AB  - The Canal del Dique, located on the Colombian Caribbean Coast, can be seen as an "artificial" branch of the River Magdalena. Since its inception in 1650, it has undergone a series of interventions aimed at optimising river navigation between Cartagena and the interior of the country, little consideration having been paid to institutional, economic, social and environmental impacts. This paper presents a systemic assessment of environmental impact (SAEI) methodology, based on systemic parameterisation of the environment, proposed by Vega [2011], for the strategic environmental assessment of policy, plans, programmes or large-scale projects, considering a case study of the Canal del Dique environmental rehabilitation as proposed by the Colombian government. Information arising from the framework of an inter-administrative agreement between the Universidad Nacional de Colombia and the Regional Autonomous Corporation for the Rio Grande de la Magdalena (CORMAGDALENA) was used for studying the environmental restoration of and navigation in the Canal del Dique [UN-LEH, 2008]. The authors developed and summarised SAEI regarding six alternatives for hydrosedimentological management in the canal to obtain results concerning environmental impairment or improvement regarding each factor considered, and the degree of aggressiveness or betterment involved in each alternative. Alternative 4, an enhanced version of current condition (ECC) would have produced the greatest environmental benefit (i.e. limited dredging plus optimising channel-wetland interconnection) requiring the narrowing of three straight reaches along the canal and the construction of a sluice-gate system in the Strait of Paracuica (near the town of El Recreo).

AB  - Background: Tuber magnatum, the Italian white truffle, is the most sought-after edible ectomycorrhizal mushroom. Previous studies report the difficulties of detecting its mycorrhizas and the widespread presence of its mycelium in natural production areas, suggesting that the soil mycelium could be a good indicator to evaluate its presence in the soil. In this study a specific real-time PCR assay using TaqMan chemistry was developed to detect and quantify T. magnatum in soil. This technique was then applied to four natural T. magnatum truffieres located in different regions of Italy to validate the method under different environmental conditions.
   Results: The primer/probe sets for the detection and quantification of T. magnatum were selected from the ITS rDNA regions. Their specificity was tested in silico and using qualitative PCR on DNA extracted from 25 different fungal species. The T. magnatum DNA concentration was different in the four experimental truffieres and higher in the productive plots. T. magnatum mycelium was however also detected in most of the non-productive plots. Ascoma production during the three years of the study was correlated with the concentration of T. magnatum DNA.
   Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest that the specific real-time PCR assay perfected in this study could be an useful tool to evaluate the presence and dynamics of this precious truffle in natural and cultivated truffieres.

AB  - Sustainable forest management usually involves the use of criteria and indicators (C&I) allowing the monitoring, reporting and assessment of management activities at national, regional and forest management unit levels. Experiences of such concepts are scarce in Nepal, particularly with regard to the evaluation of management activities within a Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) framework. In this contribution we describe how a MCA approach can be used to efficiently exploit information, knowledge, and preferences of stakeholders to address community forest management problems. Beside rating and ranking techniques, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to examine the importance of six criteria and forty-four indicators in a sustainable forest management context with a broad range of stakeholder groups. An evaluation of four management strategies in the Shree Gyneshwar community forest user group allows to demonstrate the relevance of changing priorities for different criteria. A passive adaptive management strategy focusing on a multiple use of natural resources and the introduction of production-oriented measures were identified as the most preferable option. The results of this study show that the multi-criteria analysis approach, and in particular the AHP, can assist decision-makers in efficiently evaluating management problems and generating ideas for the long-term strategic planning process of community forest management, even under complex socio-economic and ecological conditions. In that context, compromise solutions enjoy a higher possibility of being successful, taking into account the different views of stakeholder groups.

AB  - Under microcosm conditions, changes in the soil microbial biomass, respiration rates, and nitrogen pools as indicators of potential non-target effects of entomopathogenic nematodes on soil, were evaluated. Two tests were conducted using soil collected from the field with no history of entomopathogenic nematode application. Treatments consisted of applications of Steinernema carpocapsae All strain in the presence or absence of the wax moth Galleria mellonella larva as a target insect host, compared with the untreated control (soil only). In the second experiment an insecticide treatment (trichlorfon) was added. Microbial biomass (total nitrogen), and mineral nitrogen (NH4-N, NO3-N) were measured using standard methods up to 32 days and soil respiration up to 64 days in both experiments. No negative effect was detected in the soil microbial biomass, respiration and nitrogen pools after application of S. carpocapsae. However, a significant increase in ammonium was measured during almost the entire period of the test in the nematode plus larva treatment, not shown in the other treatments. This high level of ammonium in the nematode plus larva treatment showed that entomopathogenic nematodes can indirectly affect system-level processes in soil and adds evidence on the importance of indirect interactions affecting functions in soil food webs. The application of the insecticide trichlorfon significantly suppressed the microbial biomass and nitrification process. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Natural selection has different fitness consequences when it acts during different life cycle stages of an organism. In social insects, for example, the colony foundation and early colony growth is a critical time period with high probability of failure. Here we used colonies of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris L. to test whether selective episodes at different life cycle stages result in differences in colony performance and fitness. The timing of a selective episode was varied by field exposure of colonies, either permanently or during a short period at three different colony life cycle stages - early, middle, or late in the cycle. We found that selective episodes at different life cycle stages did not affect maximal size, fitness or survival of colonies, or the time span between colony foundation and reproduction. Instead, the colonies were able to compensate for costs encountered by delaying reproduction. This might have important fitness consequences, since later emerging sexuals might be faced with harsher environmental conditions and increased costs of finding a mate. In addition, an important component of selection might be parasitism and the resulting resource allocation to the immune system. We here measured the generalized immune response (i.e. encapsulation response) of early produced workers as an indicator of a colony's capacity to defend against parasitism. Encapsulation response correlated positively with eventual colony size and fitness, indicating that this measure of "immunocompetence" correlates with important life history traits.

AB  - Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) refers to a suite of methods that is increasingly being applied worldwide for sustainable groundwater management to tackle drinking or irrigation water shortage or to restore and maintain groundwater ecosystems. The potential for MAR is far from being exhausted, not only due to geological and hydrogeological conditions or technical and economic feasibility but also due to its lack of acceptance by the public and policymakers. One approach to enable the safe and accepted use of MAR could be to provide comprehensive risk management, including the identification, analysis, and evaluation of potential risks related to MAR. This article reviews current MAR risk assessment methodologies and guidelines and summarizes possible hazards and related processes. It may help planners and operators select the appropriate MAR risk assessment approaches and support the risk identification process. In addition to risk assessment (and subsequent risk treatment) related to the MAR implementation phase, this review also addresses risk assessment for MAR operation. We also highlight the limitations and lessons learned from the application and development of risk assessment methodologies. Moreover, developments are recommended in the area of MAR-related risk assessment methodologies and regulation. Depending on data availability, collected methodologies may be applicable for MAR sites worldwide. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2022;00:1-17. (c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Enclosures, mowing, and sustainable grazing were used to help restore biodiversity and the production of the natural grasslands in China. The effects of grassland management on invertebrate diversity and its associated environmental factors were less reported in northern China. The relationship between the activity-density of carabid beetles and environmental factors was conducted under three different grassland management regimes (typical enclosure, enclosed mowing, and farmer grazing practice) in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, northwestern China, from May to September 2017. Eighteen species from nine genera were collected in all regimes. The largest size of species and individuals occurred in mid-August, and species diversity and abundance were significantly greater in the typical enclosure area and the enclosed mowing area compared to the grazed area. The dominant species were Carabus vladimirskyi and Poecillus gebleri in enclosure areas and mowing areas while was Carabus glyptoterus in grazing areas. The key environmental factors associated with the activity-density of carabid beetles were soil organic matter, phosphorus, plant coverage, and plant density in enclosure areas and mowing areas. But soil temperature and pH were the main factors in grazing areas. This study implied that conservation of biodiversity requires consideration of different environmental condition in different grassland management regimes. Moreover, soil and vegetation restoration were more important for enhancing biodiversity in a grazed area than in enclosures and mowed areas in northwestern China.

AB  - Drought is a natural hazard that can inflict significant damage to agriculture, society, economy, and ecosystems. The assessment of the persistence of drought severity (PDS) assists in understanding the characteristics of droughts better and enables the development of associated prediction tools and models. This work explores the persistence and spatial-temporal variability of drought severity (DS) in the diverse dryland of Iran. Using monthly precipitation and temperature data of 44 synoptic stations from 1989 to 2018, relationships between DS coefficient of precipitation variation, aridity, and the persistence percentage are determined by the application of the standardized precipitation index (SPI), the dryland index, and the Hurst exponent (H). The results confirm the persistence of droughts in Iran as H exceeded the 0.5 threshold for all stations. The PDS average in Iran is 0.78 with high regional variability reflective of different climatic conditions and geographical locations. An inverse relationship exists between the long-term coefficient of variation of monthly precipitation and PDS in the hyper-arid and arid regions of watersheds. Higher PDS values and increasing trend in the DS are detected in dry-subhumid areas. Also, the effect of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a teleconnection metric, on the DS displays high spatial and temporal variability in Iran. The results show that the PDS is consistent with the spatial variation of DS changes during the period of 2009-2018.

AB  - Anaerobically-pretreated cardboard wastewater (APCW) contains significant residuals of organics, nitrogen species and coarse suspended solids, making the effluent quality not complying for disposal. This is the 1st investigation for treating APCW by an auto-aerated immobilized biomass (AIB) reactor packed with sponge media and ventilated naturally. The optimum hydraulic retention time (HRT) was 4.3 h, achieving CODtotal, CODsoluble, TSS, VSS, TKN, carbohydrate(total), and carbohydrate(soluble) removal efficiencies of 63.0, 58.8, 71.6, 66.0, 25.5, 38.0, and 33.5%, respectively. The bronopol (2-bromo-2-nitropropan1,3-diol) supplementation to the APCW feed reduced those removal efficiencies by 20%-40%. The mitigation of bronopol toxicity was illustrated regarding the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) to protect the bacterial biomass against the severe environment. The FTIR bands revealed the presence of bound EPS at 1633 and 1403 cm(-1) and free EPS at 1035 and 862 cm(-1). The alkanes (C-H) peaks could be an indicator for the biodegradation of bronopol into formaldehyde by the sponge-retained biomass. An artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed and optimized to predict the COD removal efficiency based on the reactor's operational conditions, attaining high accuracy (R-2 : 0.90). The model findings verify the applicability of ANN to simulate the performance of sponge-packing systems, retaining various aerobic, anoxic, and anaerobic species. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity are a prominent area of research in climate change. However, little is known about the effects of abrupt climate change and climate catastrophes on them. The probability of occurrence of such events is largely unknown but the associated risks could be large enough to influence global climate policy. Amphibians are indicators of ecosystems' health and particularly sensitive to novel climate conditions. Using state-of-the-art climate model simulations, we present a global assessment of the effects of unabated global warming and a collapse of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) on the distribution of 2509 amphibian species across six biogeographical realms and extinction risk categories. Global warming impacts are severe and strongly enhanced by additional and substantial AMOC weakening, showing tipping point behavior for many amphibian species. Further declines in climatically suitable areas are projected across multiple clades, and biogeographical regions. Species loss in regional assemblages is extensive across regions, with Neotropical, Nearctic and Palearctic regions being most affected. Results underline the need to expand existing knowledge about the consequences of climate catastrophes on human and natural systems to properly assess the risks of unabated warming and the benefits of active mitigation strategies. Julian Velasco et al. use climate model simulations to show how the collapse of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and unabated global warming under the RCP 8.5 scenario affect the global distribution of 2509 amphibian species. These results show severe and synergistic impacts of global warming, with particularly strong effects shown in the Neotropical, Nearctic and Palearctic regions.

AB  - Stone crushing processes release particulates and associated noxious substances in our surroundings that are continuously destructing environmental conditions and ecosystem health. Morpho-anatomical changes in some medicinally important native species (Aerva javanica, Calotropis procera, Digera muricata, Euphorbia prostrata, Euploca strigosa, and Peganum harmala) exposed to heavy dust pollution were evaluated. These species selected on the basis of their ubiquitous distribution in the area. Two sites were selected in the Kirana Hills, Sargodha, one near stone crushers within 500-m radius (polluted) and the other 4 km away from the crushers (control) varying significantly in amount of dust particles received. A decrease in plant height of all species from dust-polluted sites was observed. Reduction in height was more prominent in species like C. procera and D. muricata. Stem sclerification increased in C. procera and E. prostrata from the polluted site that is an indication of better tolerance to dust pollution. C. procera showed increased stem and leaf epidermis, stem sclerenchyma, and stem vascular bundles, which can increase resistance to dust pollution. E. strigosa was the most sensitive species in which all morpho-anatomical factors decreased. Survival of plant species depended on specific structural modifications in dermal, mechanical, parenchymatous, and vascular tissue. Overall, dust pollution severely affected plant morphological and micro-morphological traits, but the response of selected species to dust pollution was variable. It is concluded that stem and leaf anatomical traits like size of dermal and storage tissue thickness and stomatal density are good indicators for biomonitoring of dust pollution.

AB  - Heavy metals are an important pollutant group. Adsorption is one of the methods used to remove heavy metals from the environment. Mosses were preferred as bio-indicators because they have the capacity to accumulate many elements by their high surface-to-volume ratio. Leucodon sciuroides (Hedw.) Schwagr. (LS) are mosses that play an important part of the ecosystem and are collected from the Ida Mountain (Kazdag) region of canakkale (Turkey). For the purpose of determining the adsorption capacity of heavy metal ion (Pb2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Cu2+) analysis conditions, pH, contact time, and adsorbent amounts were determined and the maximum adsorption capacity was calculated with the help of the relevant isotherms. Heavy metal concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. It was determined that the optimum adsorption for mosses was 30 min at pH = 6.0 (the pH at which maximum adsorption occurs). The adsorption event shows that some divalent cations fit the Freundlich isotherm and some fit the Langmuir isotherm model. A pseudo-second-order reaction best fits the kinetic data for metal ions. Among the six metal ions studied, the highest adsorption was observed in Pb2+ and Cu2+ cations. According to the competitive adsorption results, the moss has a great advantage in determining the Pb(2+ )and Cu2+ cations industrially as well as other metals and in removing other metal impurities from the environment. Also, LS is exploited as a biosorbent to remove metal ions from aqueous solutions and can be used as a biomarker.

AB  - Lake littoral environments are heterogeneous, and different organisms typically show specific responses to this environmental variation. We examined local environmental and spatial factors affecting lake littoral biodiversity and the structuring of assemblages of phytoplankton, zooplankton and macroinvertebrates within and among three basins of a large lake system. We explored congruence of species composition and species richness among the studied organism groups to evaluate their general indicator potential to represent spatial variation in other groups. We expected that effects of water chemistry on plankton assemblages were stronger than effects of habitat characteristics. In contrast, we anticipated stronger effects of habitat on macroinvertebrates due to their mainly benthic mode of life. We also expected that within-basin spatial effects would be strongest on macroinvertebrates and weakest on phytoplankton. We predicted weak congruence in assemblage composition and species richness among the organism groups. Phytoplankton assemblages were mainly structured by the shared effects of water chemistry and large-scale spatial factors. In contrast to our expectations, habitat effects were stronger than water chemistry effects on zooplankton assemblages. However, as expected, macroinvertebrate species composition and richness were mainly affected by habitat conditions. Among-group congruence was weak for assemblage composition and insignificant for richness. Albeit weak, congruence was strongest between phytoplankton and zooplankton assemblages, as we expected. In summary, our analyses do not support the idea of using a single organism group as a wholesale biodiversity indicator.

AB  - The domestic usage of water generates approximately 310 km(3) of wastewater worldwide (2015, AQUASTAT, Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations). This sewage contains an important organic load due to the use of this water; this organic load is characterized using a standard method, namely, the biological oxygen demand measurement (BOD5). The BOD5 provides information about the biodegradable organic load (standard ISO 5815). However, this measurement protocol is very time-consuming (5 days) and may produce variability in approximately 20% of results mainly due to variation in the environmental inocula.
   To remedy these limitations, this work proposes an innovative concept relying on the implementation of a set of rigorously selected bacterial strains. This publication depicts the different steps used in this study, from bio-indicator selection to validation with real wastewater samples. The results obtained in the final step show a strong correlation between the developed approach and the reference method (ISO 5815) with a correlation rate of approximately 0.9. In addition, the optimization of the experimental conditions and the use of controlled strains (8 selected strains) allow significant reduction in the duration of the BOD5 analysis, with only 3 h required for the proposed method versus 5 days for the reference method. This technological breakthrough should simplify the monitoring of wastewater treatment plants and provide quicker, easier and more coherent control in terms of the treatment time.

AB  - Land managers face the challenge of conserving medicinal plants that may be threatened by harvest pressure, often with limited biological information available to inform management decisions. Osha (Ligusticum porteri) is an important medicinal plant whose roots are harvested as an herbal remedy for flu, sore throat, and other illnesses. However, little is known about population structure, root production, or the capacity of osha to recover from harvest in different environmental contexts. We compared osha population structure and root production within a gradient of canopy cover from meadow to forested habitat. We experimentally harvested roots of mature osha plants and recorded osha recolonization of pits created by root harvest. Prior to harvest, the number and percent cover of reproductive plants and the number of flowering stems per plot were higher in the meadow than in forested habitat. Canopy cover had a significant negative relationship to these variables, suggesting that osha populations benefit from increased light availability. Average root weight per plant in meadow plots was three times higher than in forested plots. One year after harvest, the majority of all harvest pits across the canopy cover gradient were recolonized by osha. Our results suggest that osha population structure and root production are significantly influenced by canopy cover, but that plants have a high capacity for post-harvest recolonization under variable light conditions. These results demonstrate the need to account for environmental factors that influence population structure when addressing concerns about the overharvest of wild medicinal plants.

AB  - Given the widespread degradation of aquatic systems caused by land-use changes associated with palm oil production in South-East Asia, it is imperative to identify and study the remaining undisturbed rivers and streams. Stream macroinvertebrates are reliable indicators of environmental health. Linking the community structure of these organisms to natural hydraulic and geomorphic conditions (categorized as biotopes) is vital for the conservation and restoration of streams. This study characterizes the effects of biotopes on macroinvertebrate community structure in three streams within Ulu Temburong National Park in northern Borneo. Biotopes within these streams were categorized as either bedrock (waterfalls and cascades) or mixed substrate (riffles and pools). In total, 119 taxa were collected from all sampled biotopes, but not all taxa were collected from each stream. Biotopes were statistically distinct in terms of taxonomic richness, but not mean individual density or average community biomass. There were differences in community structure between waterfalls, cascades, pools, and riffles. The survey suggests that pool and riffle biotopes were more vulnerable to scouring flows and had similar community structure, while waterfalls and cascades likely experienced lower sheer stress during floods and had similar macroinvertebrate communities. This study has found that classification and mapping of macroinvertebrates with biotope theory in pristine, tropical streams is a useful framework for simplifying the many linkages between ecology, geomorphology, and hydrology. These natural patterns increase our understanding of tropical streams and can be used to assess the impacts of forest degradation.

AB  - Natural resource vulnerability to climate change can depend on the climatology and ecological conditions at a particular site. Here we present a conceptual framework for incorporating spatial variability in natural resource vulnerability to climate change in a regional-scale assessment. The framework was implemented in the first regional-scale vulnerability assessment conducted by the US Forest Service. During this assessment, five subregional workshops were held to capture variability in vulnerability and to develop adaptation tactics. At each workshop, participants answered a questionnaire to: 1) identify species, resources, or other information missing from the regional assessment, and 2) describe subregional vulnerability to climate change. Workshop participants divided into six resource groups; here we focus on wildlife resources. Participants identified information missing from the regional assessment and multiple instances of subregional variability in climate change vulnerability. We provide recommendations for improving the process of capturing subregional variability in a regional vulnerability assessment. We propose a revised conceptual framework structured around pathways of climate influence, each with separate rankings for exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. These revisions allow for a quantitative ranking of species, pathways, exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity across subregions. Rankings can be used to direct the development and implementation of future regional research and monitoring programs. The revised conceptual framework is equally applicable as a stand-alone model for assessing climate change vulnerability and as a nested model within a regional assessment for capturing subregional variability in vulnerability.

AB  - Silvicultural operations increasingly aim to achieve desired water-related ecological services of forests and forest soils. Therefore, the effects of forest stand density, site, and soil depth on the water flow types were studied by conducting dye tracer experiments in two montane beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests located in the Western Carpathian Volcanic Range, Central Slovakia. Prevalent flow types were identified under usual weather conditions. Brilliant Blue FCF dye tracer was periodically applied in powder form on 1-m(2) plots in forest stands with natural and reduced stand densities, as well as in clear-cuts. When cumulative precipitation reached approximately 100 mm, soil pits were excavated. The dye patterns on the exposed profiles were photographed, and dye coverage, relative dye concentration, and stain widths were determined at various soil depths using image analysis. These patterns were used to discriminate two flow types. Continuous vertical dye plumes were interpreted as an indicator of surface-controlled flow type, which includes heterogeneous infiltration and macropore flow. The matrix-controlled flow type includes both homogeneous and heterogeneous matrix flow, as well as fingering. The log-linear analysis revealed that forest stand density and soil depth were significantly related to the soil water flow type. Preferential flow resulted from heterogeneous infiltration and fingering in the clear-cuts, from heterogeneous infiltration in the natural stands, and from macropore flow in the shelterwood stands. Distinct humus forms and skeleton fraction played a crucial role for various flow patterns observed in these beech stands.

AB  - During the last 50 years, the Spanish Mediterranean coast has experienced a massive influx of tourism that has affected the ecosystems adjacent to the coastline, triggering processes of regression and fragmentation. The changes between 1956 and 1996 are characterized and quantified here in a part of the coast next to Torredembarra (NE Spain) that occupies 470 ha. For this zone, maps of vegetation for 1956, 1985, and 1996 were prepared with a common legend of 14 units. A numerical matrix was generated with the Geographic Information System to detect-the spatial-temporal variations between units; furthermore, several landscape indicators and parameters were assessed. All of them show evidence of the accelerated substitution of an agricultural landscape and extensive areas of coastal vegetation by an urban landscape: agricultural land diminished by 64.3% and coastal vegetation by 55.3%, whereas urban areas increased by 2326.5%. If present conditions persist, in the next 30 years urban areas will occupy 87% to 100% of the territory. We also emphasize the importance of a reserve zone (natural area of interest) of 45 ha in the conservation of some coastal natural habitats listed in directive 92/43/EC. At present, this reserve creates a "buffer" effect that restrains the regression of these habitats and shows in addition a spatial continuity lacking in unprotected sectors. We also warn of the risk of disappearance of unprotected natural habitats in the short term due to urban growth and summer tourism.

AB  - In deserts, pond cladocerans suffer harsh conditions like low and erratic rainfall, high evaporation, and highly variable salinity, and they have limited species richness. The limited species can take advantage of ephippia or resting eggs for being dispersed with winds in such habitats. Thus, environmental selection is assumed to play a major role in community assembly, especially at a fine spatial scale. Located in Inner Mongolia, the Ulan Buh desert has plenty of temporary water bodies and a few permanent lakes filled by groundwater. To determine species diversity and the role of environmental selection in community assembly in such a harsh environment, we sampled 37 sand ponds in June 2012. Fourteen species of Cladocera were found in total, including six pelagic species, eight littoral species, and two benthic species. These cladocerans were mainly temperate and cosmopolitan fauna. Our classification and regression tree model showed that conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and pH were the main factors correlated with species richness in the sand ponds. Spatial analysis using a PCNM model demonstrated a broad-scale spatial structure in the cladoceran communities. Conductivity was the most significant environmental variable explaining cladoceran community variation. Two species, Moina cf. brachiata and Ceriodaphnia reticulata occurred commonly, with an overlap at intermediate conductivity. Our results, therefore, support that environmental selection plays a major role in structuring cladoceran communities in deserts.

AB  - Peat bog pools are rare and fragmented in the Western Balkans. Thus, aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity and the implications for microhabitat loss in these ecosystems are poorly known. Aquatic oligochaetes, widely used as indicators, were sampled using a benthos net in the largest and oldest Croatian bog, in four main water body types: a pond, a deep pool, a shallow pool and a ditch. As these microhabitats lack spatial replication both in the studied bog and in the region, we applied a nested study design with replicates sampled over time. We found a species-rich aquatic oligochaete fauna, with 11 taxa recorded. Oligochaete communities were strongly affected by vegetation complexity and the morphology of bog water bodies, namely, their size and depth. As revealed by generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs), taxon richness and abundance were significantly higher in the ditch than in other water body types. This could be attributed to the vegetation complexity, supporting many different niches and providing allochthonous food supplies for oligochaetes. The various bog pools contribute to regional biodiversity and promote distinct patterns in the spatial distribution of oligochaetes. However, the predominance of ubiquitous oligochaetes, with high taxon richness, might indicate the degradation of the studied peat bog. This was further confirmed by the spread of vascular plants to the bog area and higher pH water values. All these warning signals suggest that hydro-ecological conditions should be urgently improved in order to preserve communities in the bog studied.

AB  - Using panel data of 30 provinces and regions in Mainland China (excluding Tibet) from 2006 to 2016, the Spatial Durbin Model was employed for the empirical research, and the spatial impact of fiscal decentralization and environmental decentralization on regional carbon emissions were analyzed from the perspective of promotion pressure of officials. The empirical study concludes: ; Fiscal decentralization, both within the region and in its neighborhood, will contribute to carbon emissions in the region; Environmental decentralization will help reduce carbon emissions, while environmental decentralization in neighboring regions will increase carbon emissions in the region; The promotion pressure of officials plays a positive role in moderating the impact of fiscal decentralization on carbon emissions, and at the same time weakens the suppression of carbon emissions by environmental decentralization; From a regional point of view, there is a positive relationship between fiscal decentralization and carbon emissions in various regions; but environmental decentralization has obvious spatial heterogeneity. The research suggests that reducing the degree of local fiscal decentralization, investment in major infrastructure projects involving high carbon emissions should be relatively centralized; appropriately increase the environmental management authority of local environmental protection agencies, fully use the advantages of local environmental protection departments to protect the environment according to local conditions; gradually improve the assessment system for local officials, moderately reduce the proportion of fiscal revenue and GDP assessment in areas with fragile ecological environment, and increase incentives for ecological performance assessment, put the development of low-carbon economy into practice.

AB  - Conservation Agriculture approach could be strategic for Soil Quality (SQ) conservation under the Mediterranean conditions of Southern Europe's environments. In this study, we reported the results obtained during a 2-year field experiment (split-plot design) of a 7-year experiment started in 2010-2011, combining two tillage practices (Conventional Tillage (CT) and Zero Tillage (ZT)) with two crop sequences (Wheat monocropping (WW) and Wheat-Faba bean (WF)). SQ was monitored through the selection of some chemical, physical, and biological indicators measured by both visual - Visual Soil Assessment (VSA) - and standard field or laboratory measurements. ZT produced higher values for some VSA indicators, i.e., 'soil structure and consistence' and 'earthworms counts', as well as for soil organic carbon content (0.84vs. 0.75% in ZT and CT, respectively). CT+WW and CT+WF treatments released significantly higher CO(2)fluxes of 35% and 41% than ZT+WW and ZT+WF, respectively. No clear effect of soil tillage practices on community-level physiological profiles was observed; conversely, WF induced higher values of well-color development, richness (R), and Shannon-Weaver index (H) than WW. Under dry Mediterranean areas, ZT practices, especially when combined with the other conservation principles (i.e., crop rotation), seem to ameliorate several SQ indicators already after 7-year period of adoption, allowing a positive trend for soil preservation.

AB  - This study analyzes the environmental benefits that a nitrogen fertilizer based on activated biochar has in comparison to other traditional fertilizers (urea, ammonium nitrate (AN), ammonium sulfate (AS) and diammonium phosphate (DAP)). With this aim, activated biochar was generated from residual biomass (barley straw) through physical activation and the resulting biochar was combined with mineral fertilizer to synthethise the fertilizer. This new product was subjected to environmental assessment by means of two different approaches, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and nitrogen footprint procedure, both of which considered standard conditions typical of Mediterranean climate and wheat and corn as the fertilized crops. Emission factors of traditional fertilizers were obtained from internally developed models, which were in turn based on real data from literature. As for emission factors of the new product, they were calculated basing on experimental results. Fertilizer impacts in terms of acidification, eutrophication and climate change were estimated, thus revealing a great performance of activated biochar over other fertilizers in terms of reactive nitrogen (Nr), reaching a maximum saving rate of 63% in the amount of Nr released by volatilization and leaching. In addition, this work offers a methodology for environmental analysis of fertilizers and provides useful quantitative indicators for the environmental benefit and the saving of reactive nitrogen, which could contribute to the development of new commercial low N-emissions fertilizers.

AB  - Since the production of food and beverages is energy-intensive, the political, economic, ecologic and social conditions are posing a challenge to the manufacturing industry. Small- and medium-sized companies in particular lack the time and knowledge to identify and implement suitable energy efficiency measures. With the help of computer-aided solutions, decision-makers can pursue numerous approaches and make well-founded decisions. The aim of this review is to summarise and critically discuss current analysis and prediction methods concerning energy and media consumption in the beverage industry. To date, there have been no tools or approaches available that permit a simple, holistic analysis and prediction. Breweries serve as a good example for the beverage industry due to numerous and various complex processes. To identify energy-saving potential, the main consumers and consumption structures within the brewery are presented. Current approaches such as simulations, pinch analyses, benchmarks and real-time operating systems are briefly explained, and the relevant publications related to the beverage industry described and categorised. The critical comparison of the different approaches clearly shows that simulation enables a holistic analysis and prediction of energy and media consumption in the brewery. Since the data basis is mostly insufficient and this method requires expert knowledge, we propose a holistic modelling and simulation approach. An easy-to-use and context-free modelling environment should enable the generation of a simulation model, with limited expertise or effort.

AB  - Micropaleontological studies of the Black Sea, including ostracod records, have suggested that early Holocene salinity values were between similar to 5 and 10 practical salinity units (psu), contrasting with present values of 18-22 psu. However, more precise paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on ostracod assemblages require additional information related to their modern ecological affinities. This study uses modern species information collected from samples with living fauna to interpret the fossil Holocene assemblages of two sediment cores, Ak-2575 and Ak-521, collected from the northeastern outer shelf of the Black Sea. A total of 37 ostracod species are recorded in the fossil assemblages, with 2 related to freshwater/oligohaline environments, 23 from Caspian-type environments, and 12 from environments similar to the Mediterranean. Three distinct assemblage zones are identified from the Caspian type dominating in the early Holocene up to 7.4 cal ka BP, a mixed assemblage of Caspian type and Mediterranean type from 7.4 to 6.8 cal ka BP, and a progressive dominance of Mediterranean species from 6.8 cal ka BP. It is very likely that the dominant control of ostracod species occurrence during the period up to similar to 6.8 cal ka BP is salinity. A range of factors including temperature, biotope, and sedimentation rates influenced the species distribution over the last 6.8 cal ka BP.

AB  - The small wastewater treatment plant is a device or group of devices whichthrough mechanical, biological, and chemical processesreduces the pollution load to the values specified in the Regulation of the Minister of the Environment. The aim of this research is to show the relationship between the growth ofthe biomass and the effectiveness of removing contaminants from wastewater in individual wastewater treatment systems. The results of activated sludge volume after 30min settling, microscopic analysis, and quantitative and qualitative parameters of biomass in the aeration chambers were analyzed in this article. During the research, one of the reactors was converted into a hybrid reactor (SBR filled with plastic carriers, which support the process of nitrification). A microscopic analysis of the biomass was conducted to evaluate the operation of activated sludge and biofilm. Flocs of activated sludge in the SBR were characterized by irregular shape and high biodiversity. The appearance of rotifers testified about the good condition of the sludge. The microscopic analysis of biomass of the hybrid reactor showed a negative effect of the applied biopreparation. Microorganisms such as bacteria and ciliates were observed in the biomass. In summary, the structure of the biofilm and activated sludge floc is very sensitive to the system parameters and external factors. Biofilm develops more slowly than the activated sludge. Introduction of the moving bed into the reactor of activated sludge should be made in the summertime.

AB  - Long-term sustainability and a declining trend in productivity of rice-wheat rotation in the Indo-Gangetic plain, often direct towards the changes in soil quality parameters. Soil quality is decided through few sensitive soil physical, chemical and biological indicators as it cannot be measured directly. The present investigation was carried out to develop a valid soil quality index through some chosen indicators under long-term influences of tillage, water and nutrient-management practices in a rice-wheat cropping system. The experiment consisted of two tillage treatments, three irrigation treatments, and nine nutrient management treatments for both rice and wheat, was continued for 8 years. The index was developed using expert-opinion based conceptual framework model. After harvest of rice, the CFSQI-P (productivity) was higher under puddled situation, whereas CFSQI-EP (environmental protection) was more under non-puddled condition and 3-days of drainage was found promising for all the indices. No-tillage practice always showed higher soil quality index. The treatments either receiving full organics (100 % N) or 25 % substitution of fertilizer N with organics showed higher soil quality indices. Puddling, irrigation after 3 days of drainage and substitution of 25 % recommended fertilizer N dose with FYM in rice could be practiced for maintaining or enhancing soil quality. No-tillage, two irrigations, and domestic sewage sludge in wheat can safely be recommended for achieving higher soil quality.

AB  - Marine threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculatus L., 1758) have repeatedly colonized Holarctic freshwater environments after the retreat of the Pleistocene glaciers, and based on their ability to move rapidly between salinities have apparently retained a robust osmoregulatory apparatus that can cope with both short- and long-term exposure to non-native salinity environments. Standard metabolic rate (SMR), measured as oxygen consumption at rest, can be used as an indicator of the cost of osmoregulation when fish are exposed to new environmental conditions. Following freshwater colonization, reduction in the number of lateral plates, an antipredator defence structure, is common. Completely plated fish dominate in the sea, low-plated fish dominate in fresh water, and partially plated fish often dominate in brackish water environments. In a laboratory experiment, we estimated SMR in locally adapted populations from salt, brackish, and freshwater environments at three different salinities (0, 15, and 30 practical salinity units (PSU)). In addition, we tested for correlations between SMR and lateral plate number and lateral plate genotype at the Ectodysplasin locus for stickleback originating from the brackish water population. Contrary to our expectations, no differences were found in SMR between any of the experimental groups in our experiment. Apparently, the threespine stickleback is able to move among salinity environments without large short-term metabolic costs, irrespective of their environment of origin.

AB  - Problems with water resources security (WRS) resulting from water scarcity are occurring worldwide, and the most feasible solution to such problems is to increase the productivity of limited water resources through rational water use allocation within the affected region. In this study, an optimal water allocation model (OWAM) based on WRS assessment was developed and applied to improve the water use benefits in Zhangjiakou Region of northern China in 2020. The OWAM was an optimal linear programming model that comprehensively considered eco-environmental and socio-economic benefits. Some WRS assessment indicators that can be easily adjusted, including the ratio of ecological water to total water demand, surface water pollution index, exploitation ratio of water resources, water supply per capita, industrial water scarcity, and agricultural water scarcity, were incorporated into the OWAM as constraining conditions. The model had different solutions corresponding to four WRS statuses (quite safe, basically safe, unsafe, and extremely unsafe). The results indicated that optimal water allocation determined using this model met the domestic and environmental water demand, and led to increased water use benefits within the region when compared with before allocation. The benefits of basically safe status were bigger than those of unsafe status. In contrast to the conventional OWAM, the developed model could help to assure sustainable water use at the regional scale when used in combination with WRS assessment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Development of blood leukocyte gene transcript profiles has the potential to expand condition assessments beyond those currently available to evaluate wildlife health, including sea otters Enhydra lutris, both individually and as populations. The 10 genes targeted in our study represent multiple physiological systems that play a role in immuno-modulation, inflammation, cell protection, tumor suppression, cellular stress-response, xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, and antioxidant enzymes. These genes can be modified by biological, physical, or anthropogenic impacts and consequently provide information on the general type of stressors present in a given environment. We compared gene transcript profiles of sea otters sampled in 2008 among areas within Prince William Sound impacted to varying degrees by the 1989 'Exxon Valdez' oil spill with those of captive and wild reference sea otters. Profiles of sea otters from Prince William Sound showed elevated transcription in genes associated with tumor formation, cell death, organic exposure, inflammation, and viral exposure when compared to the reference sea otter group, indicating possible recent and chronic exposure to organic contaminants. Sea otters from historically designated oiled areas within Prince William Sound 19 yr after the oil spill had higher transcription of genes associated with tumor formation, cell death, heat shock, and inflammation than those from areas designated as less impacted by the spill.

AB  - Patterns of habitat use by spider crab juveniles, Maja brachydactyla, from two geographic areas on the NW coast of the Iberian Peninsula were studied through the analysis of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope relations in muscle and hepatopancreas. Main potential preys of spider crab juveniles in rocky and sandy habitats and different organic matter sources in coastal food webs were also analysed. Isotopic ratios showed no difference between rocky and sandy habitats. The use of carapace colour and epibiosis as an indicator of habitat use was not Supported by our data. These results Suggest that movements between the two habitats are much more frequent than Suggested in previous studies. In the coastal food web, two main trophic compartments were identified according to their organic matter source: one based on plankton and seaweeds (rocky habitats), and one based on sedimentary particulate organic matter (sandy bottoms). By means of the model of Phillips and Gregg (2003), it was found that juveniles of Maja brachydactyla from both habitats consumed approximately two thirds of the preys in rocky habitats and one third in sedimentary habitats. The results indicate that in exposed environments large juveniles spend most of the time on sedimentary bottoms. where they find more refuge, moving frequently to nearby rocky Substrates to feed.

AB  - The influences of metal contamination, fish size, season, and region on tissue metabolic capacities and protein concentrations were examined in yellow perch from two metal gradients (Sudbury, Ontario, and Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, Canada) in two seasons (spring and summer). In general, increased tissue Cu and Cd contamination was associated with lower aerobic capacities, suggesting direct metal inhibition of aerobic enzymes. However, our data also revealed that tissue Ni contamination positively affected aerobic capacities, possibly due to oxidative damage to mitochondrial membranes leading to compensatory increases in the activity of mitochondrial enzymes. Tissue aerobic capacities decreased, but anaerobic capacities increased, with size. Tissue protein concentrations and metabolic capacities were also influenced by season. A novel finding of this study is that size-corrected tissue enzyme activities can differ markedly in yellow perch sampled in the same season in similar lakes, but separated by a few hundred kilometers. Overall, the results from this large dataset support that tissue metabolic capacities are under seasonal and regional influences, but are also affected by metal contamination. Our study indicates that tissue metabolic enzyme activities should be considered as a tool for ecological risk assessment studies aiming at detecting metal stress in wild fish. However, fish should be sampled over a short period, and reference sites should be close to contaminated sites.

AB  - In 1992, a study was begun to compare the effect of landfarming vs. natural attenuation on the restoration of soil that had been contaminated with crude oil. Each of three lysimeters was filled with a sandy loam topsoil, and crude oil was applied to two of the lysimeters. One of the contaminated lysimeters was tilled, watered, and received a one-time application of fertilizer (N, P, K). No amendments were added to the second contaminated lysimeter, and the third was left uncontaminated. The lysimeters were monitored for 6 months and then left unattended.
   In 1995 and again in 1997 we sampled these lysimeters to evaluate the long-term effects of contamination and bioremediation. In 1995 we found marked effects on soil chemistry, bacterial, fungal, nematode, and plant populations and a higher rate of bioremediation in the fertilized-contaminated lysimeter (Lawlor et al., 1997). Data from 1997 and previously unreported data from 1995 are the subject of the current report. In 1997, low densities of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were found in all the lysimeters and little loss of TPH from the two contaminated lysimeters, suggesting a decreased rate of bioremediation. Nevertheless, there were increases in diversity and number of functional groups of bacteria, nematodes, and native plant species. However, molecular analyses revealed marked differences remained in the composition of dominant eubacterial species, and tests of soybeans indicated field conditions remained unsuitable for these plants.

AB  - Stability of a soil property to perturbation comprises both resistance and resilience. Resistance is defined as the ability of the soil to withstand the immediate effects of perturbation, and resilience the ability of the soil to recover from perturbation. Functional stability is used here to describe the stability of a biological function to perturbation, rather than the stability of physical structure or chemical properties. The function chosen for this study was the short-term decomposition of added plant residues, and the perturbations were copper and heat stresses. Previous studies had shown that functional stability was reduced greatly in soils with experimentally reduced biodiversity. The objective of this study was to determine the relative sensitivity of functional stability and potential indicators of biological status to detect alteration of held soils by various environmental impacts. Functional stability, protozoan populations and substrate mineralisation kinetics, were measured on paired soils with: high or low plant species diversity; hydrocarbon pollution or not; extensive or intensive agricultural management practices. Substrate mineralisation kinetics were poorly related to the soil's antecedent conditions and were stimulated significantly by hydrocarbon pollution. Protozoan populations were potentially useful for detecting differences within soil type, but will require greater taxonomic input to be most useful. Functional stability particularly resistance, was able to quantify differences between and within soils. The potential development of the technique in relation to soil health is discussed.

AB  - The basic principles of the physics of shock waves are summarised, showing how shock pressures, shock and post-shock temperatures, and shock durations can be estimated in the case of large meteorite impacts on Earth. In a second part, the pertinence of laboratory high-pressure dynamic experiments for simulating large meteroite impact events and for calibrating their physical conditions is discussed. It is concluded that most shock features are common to natural and laboratory shocks, although the lifetime of experimental shocked states is shorter by several orders of magnitude. Then, a review is made of the major shock effects observed in minerals and rocks. Quartz has been by far, the most extensively studied shock mineral. particularly, planar deformation features (PDFs), interpreted as resulting from relaxations at the shock front, are unambiguous shock indicators, for shock pressures approximately between 15 and 35 GPa. At higher pressures, the formation of high-pressure polymorphs of SiO2 in shocked quartz is also discussed. Shock effects in some other selected minerals, although less extensively studied, are also reviewed, with special emphasis on the discovery of diamonds at impact sites and of all the high-pressure polymorphs of olivines an pyroxenes, including silicate perovskite, in shocked meteorites. Finally, the controversial links between large impacts and major environmental effects are discussed in a fourth part. ((C) Academie des sciences/Elsevier, Paris).

AB  - High-speed railway (HSR) express freight train service sites selection is critical to the development of China's Third Party Logistics market. In this paper, we formulate an improved entropy-cloud model based approach to solve the HSR express sites selection problem for the first time. The basic data of the indicators, for example, existing railway network conditions, traffic environment, express freight market demand, and policy, will be used as the inputs. We apply improved entropy method to obtain each subindicator's weight. The cloud model will be used to select and classify each station under evaluation.

AB  - Micromorphological studies of reclaimed solonchakous solonetzes at the Dzhanybek Research Station with a sampling interval of 20 years are carried out to evaluate recent trends in the development of pedogenic processes in these soils. Soil microfabrics and composition and, particularly, salt pedofeatures are shown to be sensitive indicators of processes and conditions at the interface between the bulk solid soil and the porous volume. For the reclaimed solonetzes, it has been found that their arable horizons became more homogeneous; the diversity and amount of calcareous and gypsiferous pedofeatures in the soil profiles decreased, and the ameliorative effect became more pronounced after 20-year reclamation.

AB  - Since 1980, Lake Geneva has been recovering from eutrophication as indicated by the decrease of phosphorus concentrations. Oligochaete communities, sampled in 1996 from the submarine EA.-Forel, were used to monitor the recovery of deep sediments (185 m - 300 m). Biomass of oligochaetes decreased with depth. Species indicative of oligotrophic conditions (mostly Spirosperma velutinus and Stylodrilus heringianus) were abundant between 185 m and 240 m, but scarce deeper. This indicates that the biological recovery of sediments proceeds smoothly shallower than 240 m, but is delayed by the persistence of low oxygen concentrations at greater depths.

A survey was carried out in two nature reserves in the park, Mlynicka Valley and Studene Valleys, during the 2012 and 2013 summer seasons. The questionnaire focused on several topics relevant for visitor management. In this paper we present partial results of the survey, focusing on visual simulations for crowding and vegetation loss. Findings from both study areas point towards the need for management action since preferred conditions for both indicators had been exceeded.

AB  - Data on expectations collected by business surveys offer the opportunity to test the rational expectation hypothesis. Tests directly based on qualitative data are not powerful because of the nature of the data. An alternative method is proposed in this paper. We apply the usual orthogonality conditions of rationality to the unobservable variables which are assumed to trigger the categorical responses of surveys when they cross certain thresholds. To implement the test, an original estimation method for latent variable models using indicators is required. The results show that the Hypothesis is not always rejected for the expectations of changes in demand drawn from surveys of French manufacturing industry.

It was proven that, on average, the temperature of spent cooling water was higher by 6.3 degrees C than the temperature of natural waters. Oxygen conditions were favorable for water biocenoses, whereas concentrations and transformations of biogenic elements were characteristic for eutrophized waters. Average annual primary production of spent cooling water equaled 0.300 mgC.dm(-3).h(-1) and exceeded by 27% primary production of water that had not been subject to thermal pollution.

AB  - An increased level of serum creatine kinase has been considered as an indirect sign of muscular disorders but it may be an indicator of other diseases (malignant hyperthermia, tumors or endocrinopathy). Some patients present with a stationary clinical condition and absence of muscular symptoms, in whom the unique abnormality is hyperCKemia that is not associated with any biological or genetic diagnosis of MD.

LA  - English
AB  - Nitrification is crucial for the content of inorganic nitrogen in soil and hence of considerable ecological and agricultural importance.  The first step in the nitrification process, the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite, is particularly sensitive to chemicals, and the ammonium oxidation activity of soils may thus be used as an indicator of chemical disturbances.  A method for the determination of potential nitrification has been tested that measures ammonium oxidation specifically and under optimal conditions, has a good reproducibility, and makes it possible to screen a large number of chemicals during a short period of time.  The method has been tested with a number of pesticides.  Dithiocarbamate fungicides gave the most pronounced inhibition of ammonium oxidation.

AB  - This article draws attention to a number of critical issues that exist in the current Australian research context which simultaneously enable and constrain children's participation in research. These include prevailing understandings of children and childhood, the emerging research assessment environment and the ethical frameworks that regulate children's involvement in qualitative research. The discussion is framed by a number of questions that remain unsettled for the authors as they attempt to pursue research with and for children and young people that is unselfconsciously focused on 'improving' rather than 'proving' the social conditions that shape their lives.

AB  - No accumulation of heavy metals was revealed in the deep (7.5 m) central zone of a eutrophic peatbog. Ti and W are the most dispersed elements in the peat deposit; Fe, Mo, and Mn are the most accumulated elements. The distribution of heavy metals during peat genesis depends on the quality of sorption humus barriers, and the redox zonality of the peat deposit and, hence, is indicative of the redox stages of boo evolution. Mo is a universal indicator element; its distribution in the peat profile clearly differentiates the redox conditions in both oxidative and reductive environments.

AB  - Woody vegetation is an important environmental component in most landscapes.  The occurrence of some forms of woody cover is indicative of resource degradation whereas degradation is indicated by lack of cover in other situations.  A capacity to measure cover, and hence change, to an acceptable level of accuracy is thus an important indicator of resource degradation under most conditions.  A means of estimating the percentage cover within individual resolution elements of scanner data has been developed and evaluated, with the results achieved being reported in this article.  These results are sufficient for the technique to be included as an operational component in a rangelands monitor in New South Wales.

AB  - A good indicator of biological activity is required for the activated sludge process to operate efficiently; in biological treatment plants.  The relationship between dehydrogenase activity (DHA) using INT (2-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(p-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride and oxygen-uptake rate (OUR) on the laboratory-scale experiment was investigated for 3 months.  Both DHA and OUR increased in the presence of substrate, but a substrate in excess had no adverse effect on them.  Although the condition of activated sludge varied from the bulking stage to the flocculation stage during the experimental period, a good linear relationship (DHA = 0.145.OUR+22.0, r = 0.849, n = 62) between DHA and OUR was observed.

Fertilization affects population densities and the community structure of soil coenoses markedly so that sensitive groups or species of mites and collembolans (Isotomidae, e.g. Isotomiella minor) can be used as bioindicators for soil condition changes. While pure N-fertilizers decrease abundance, species-composition and diversity, well chosen ''slow release'' fertilizers (e. g. Biomag, Biomag with Bactosol) can positively influence soil coenoses and their turnover activities.

AB  - Even under conditions of large scale production domestic cattle retain social requirements evolved by their free living ancestors. Social behaviour and group structure therefore now require special adaptations and influence performance, especially if the groups of animals are too large or too dense, or when group memberships change. The decision between socially beneficial and socially deleterious rearing strategies is of special importance. For that purpose, a wide range of stress indicators has to be studied and reference systems have to be examined in which the genetically determined potential of performance can be realised. In this way, it can be established whether anonymity can really substitute for a secure social environment.

Four dimensions constitute MSWEI: governance; gravimetry and logistics; sorting, valuation, and composting; and final disposal. The MSWEI reached 37.6%, corresponding to an inadequate MSW management system. The main MSW management guidelines include the development of environmental education; selective collection, sorting of dry recyclable materials and shipping to the capital Luanda; composting of the organic waste; creation of an inter-municipality consortium to share the costs of a landfill.

AB  - The environmental gentrification hypothesis predicts that environmental quality improvements in poor communities may spur gentrification and the displacement of residents. The author analyzes the relationship between hazardous site cleanups and gentrification in Portland, Oregon, during the 1990s. Using resident-defined neighborhoods as the unit of analysis, the author finds that there is no relationship between the extent of gentrification a neighborhood experiences and the perceived or actual environmental improvement that precedes it. Based on this evidence, the author suggests that similar types of cities may be able to improve environmental conditions relatively equitably without exacerbating concerns related to gentrification and social justice.

AB  - Numerous indices have been developed to assess water quality and the impact of programs to improve quality. The Index of Watershed Indicators (IWI) is one such index created by the US Environmental Protection Agency to assess watershed vulnerability and condition in the United States. The credibility and applicability of subjective indices such as IWI depends upon their ability to withstand tests that challenge their internal consistency and interpretation. This paper critiques IWI on the basis of these tests and other considerations, and suggests that explicitly basing the index on multiattribute utility theory and methods could help resolve many of these difficulties.

AB  - In this paper, we describe a method employing motion-sensing radio transmitters for recording and identifying behavioural patterns and activity of Atlantic salmon spawning under natural conditions. Simultaneous video monitoring verified recorded activity patterns originating from behaviours such as fighting, nest digging and quivering. The method described here enables more accurate determination of the timing and location of spawning compared to conventional location tracking. Motion-sensing transmitters can also be applied to monitor other species and types of behaviour, and therefore the use and development of such methods deserves further attention in behavioural studies.

AB  - Uncertainty is inherent in extrapolating from effects upon the individual to alterations in ecological structure or function. Subtle differences in individuals within a population can give rise to significant evolutionary events. Populations are part of ecological structures, systems that are clearly complex, requiring an understanding of the interacting components, stochastic inputs and spatial scales. A series of patch-dynamic models is used to illustrate the importance of spatial arrangement and initial population size in predicting effects at a landscape level. The importance of understanding the spatial structure of a population in uncertainty reduction is addressed.

AB  - Government programs that help agricultural producers manage risk may have environmental consequences. In recent years, premium subsidies for crop insurance have been increased substantially to encourage greater producer participation. Using detailed, producer-level crop insurance contract data in four regions, we investigate whether adverse environmental effects have resulted from these increased subsidies. We find some association between environmental effects and insurance contracts. On average, however, we find that environmental effects are generally small and as often beneficial as adverse. More importantly, we find that results are specific to local conditions and to particular environmental indicators and may be hidden in aggregate analysis.

AB  - Radiocarbon data from 150 archaeological excavations in the now hyper-arid Eastern Sahara of Egypt, Sudan, Libya, and Chad reveal close links between climatic variations and prehistoric occupation during the past 12,000 years. Synoptic multiple-indicator views for major time slices demonstrate the transition from initial settlement after the sudden onset of humid conditions at 8500 B. C. E. to the exodus resulting from gradual desiccation since 5300 B. C. E. Southward shifting of the desert margin helped trigger the emergence of pharaonic civilization along the Nile, influenced the spread of pastoralism throughout the continent, and affects sub-Saharan Africa to the present day.

AB  - This literature survey was undertaken by the Sugar Milling Research Institute in South Africa in 1996, but covers experience in other parts of the world,
   It concludes that crop damage caused by frost is largely dependent on the severity and duration of the freeze and is influenced by environmental conditions at the time (e.g. drought, humidity, post-freeze temperature and cane infection),
   As far as milling cane quality is concerned, the usual products of cane deterioration are evident, with cane tops being particularly affected so that topping practices become important,
   Acidity, gums (or dextran) and ethanol have been used with varying degrees of success as indicators of post-freeze deterioration.

AB  - The modelling system LADM, consisting of a prognostic mesoscale model and a Lagrangian dispersion model, has been used to assess the impact of existing and proposed emitters in a region of complex terrain. The highest ground-level concentrations of sulphur dioxide are predicted to occur in stable conditions when elevated plumes impact on local terrain. Early-morning fumigation and convective knockdown of plumes also lead to high concentrations. Under normal background levels of hydrocarbons, it is found that maximum ozone values occur 100 km downwind towards the end of the day, and that addition of further NOx sources would not increase these maxima.

AB  - The analysis of the benthic foraminiferal assemblages recovered from the Jurassic sequence exposed at Jhurio Dome, Kutch, reveals the presence of six types of major morphogroups, some of them subdivided into subgroups. Changes in benthic foraminiferal morphogroups, including life habitat (from epifaunal to deep infaunal) and nutritional behaviour (from herbivores to omnivores, suspension-feeders to bacterial scavengers and detritivores to primary weed fauna) are mainly influenced by fluctuations in nutrient flux, oxygen availability, salinity and bathymetry and are reliable indicators to interpret palaeoenvironmental fluctuations during the deposition of the sediments.
   The Middle to Upper Jurassic sequence of Jhurio Dome is subdivided into four palaeoecological intervals on the basis of benthic foraminiferal morphogroup associations. Deposition in Palaeoecological interval I commenced with a transgressive phase in the outer shelf region with normal salinity as well as high oxygen and nutrient availability. Palaeoecological interval II witnessed fluctuating hyposaline conditions, depleted oxygen and low nutrient availability in a regressive episode in the middle shelf environment. Palaeoecological interval III is considered to have been deposited in a transgressive phase in the deepest part of the outer shelf with high salinity, increased levels of oxygen and nutrient flux. Palaeoecological interval IV, representing the upper part of the studied sequence is characterised by normal salinity, decreased oxygen levels, and high nutrient influx in a regressive middle shelf environment. The morphogroup analysis shows that, during the deposition of the analysed stratigraphic intervals, the environmental conditions at the sediment depositional site did not remain stable as indicated by the fluctuating shoreline on a tectonically rather unstable oceanic shelf.

AB  - Introduction: Tuberculosis remains a major health problem worldwide, killing thousand adults and children every year mainly in developing countries as Brazil. The disease is socially determined, caused mainly by inequalities as overcrowding, bad conditions of housing, unemployment, and limited access to health care. The aim of this study was to identify the social inequalities associated with the onset of tuberculosis in disease-prone territories in a city from the Northeast. Methodology: This was an ecological study, which has gathered patients diagnosed with tuberculosis through secondary data source in a city from the northeast of Brazil. The GAMLSS statistical model has been applied considering as response variable the count of Tuberculosis cases and the independent variable, the social conditions. The double Poisson distribution was considered in the analysis. The best model fitted was selected according the Akaike information criterion value. For all tests, thep value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: 460 patients with diagnosis of tuberculosis were identified, which represents an incidence of 36.3 cases/100,000 in males and 20.7 cases/100,000 in females. Regarding social inequality associated with tuberculosis, income (households with per capita income between 1/8 and 3 minimum wages), gender and age (Proportion of males under 15 years of age) were associated with the disease. Conclusions: The findings evidenced the social determinants associated with tuberculosis, with a greater occurrence of the disease in areas with mostly male children and low-income families, these issues must be managed within and beyond the health sector, which is mandatory for the Tuberculosis elimination.

AB  - Broiler productivity is dependent on a range of variables; among them, the rearing environment is a significant factor for proper well-being and productivity. Behavior indicates the bird's initial response to an adverse environment and is capable of providing an indicator of well-being in real-time. The present study aims to identify and characterize the sequential pattern of broilers' behavior when exposed to thermoneutral conditions (TNZ) and thermal stress (HS) by constant heat. The research was carried out in a climatic chamber with 18 broilers under thermoneutral conditions and heat stress for three consecutive days (at three different ages). The behavior database was first analyzed using one-way ANOVA, Tukey test by age, and Boxplot graphs, and then the sequence of the behaviors was evaluated using the generalized sequential pattern (GSP) algorithm. We were able to predict behavioral patterns at the different temperatures assessed from the behavioral sequences. Birds in HS were prostrate, identified by the shorter behavioral sequence, such as the {Lying down, Eating} pattern, unlike TNZ ({Lying down, Walking, Drinking, Walking, Lying down}), which indicates a tendency to increase behaviors (feeding and locomotor activities) that guarantee the better welfare of the birds. The sequence of behaviors 'Lying down' followed by 'Lying laterally' occurred only in HS, which represents a stressful thermal environment for the bird. Using the pattern mining sequences approach, we were able to identify temporal relationships between thermal stress and broiler behavior, confirming the need for further studies on the use of temporal behavior sequences in environmental controllers.

AB  - The study section at the Casa de Piedra locality (Neuque ' n Basin) is located near the Colorado River, southwestern sector of La Pampa province, Argentina. The section is assigned to the Roca Formation, which records a shallow marine environment linked with Atlantic transgressions. It includes a new record of dinoflagellate cysts of the Danian Sea, in northern Patagonia. Most of the recognized taxa have a Late Cretaceous - Danian stratigraphic range in the Southern Hemisphere. The great similarity with the dinoflagellate cysts recorded in the uppermost Pedro Luro Formation, Colorado Basin allowed inferring a Late Danian age for the Roca Formation in the Casa de Piedra section. This age is also supported by the presence of Vozzhennikovia apertura (FAD: 65.10 Ma) and Cerodinium diebelli (LAD: 61.05 Ma) and by other micofossils data including foraminifers and nannofosils. The sedimentary facies and the dinoflagellate cysts identified suggest a neritic environment ranging from marginalmarine with scarce fluvial influence to outer neritic conditions. Taking into account the sporomorphs content, the paleoenvironment conditions would be similar to those of the North-west and Colorado Basins for the Danian, with a forest of Ulmaceae (Verrustephanoporites simplex) and montane forest (Podocarpaceae, Rutaceae). The sporomorph assemblages indicate warm paleotemperatures (subtropical-tropical). The high similarity of dinoflagellate cyst records between Roca and Pedro Luro Formations would suggest a probable link between Neuque ' n and Colorado basins during Danian times. This connection has been postulated by several authors and could be related to the Neuque ' n embayment through the Huincul fault.

AB  - Over the last 5 decades, natural populations of pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and chum (O. keta) salmon were the most abundant salmon species returning to Washington, USA. Pink salmon predominantly returned in odd years, and chum salmon stocks that interacted with pink salmon exhibited strong even- and odd-year variations in abundance, size, age-at-maturity, and productivity (recruits-per-spawner). We investigated the effects of competition between pink and chum salmon originating from Washington during different life-history phases. Overall, chum salmon returns were 34% lower in pink salmon (odd) years compared to non-pink salmon (even) years. Chum salmon productivity tended to be below average for odd broods, especially along the Washington coast where there are no pink salmon populations, suggesting that competition during overlapping marine periods established their distinct even- and odd-year patterns. We evaluated long-term trends in chum (and pink) salmon productivity using correlation and time series analysis and examined the influence of ocean indicators on those trends. In general, chum salmon productivity increased between brood years 1968 and 1989 and was positively related to summertime Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), but declined between brood years 1990 and 2012 and was negatively related to the PDO. Pink salmon productivity had no directional trend, but exhibited declines over the last decade and was negatively related to the PDO over the entire time series. Chum salmon productivity was also negatively related to pink salmon abundance, supporting the conclusion that ocean conditions and competition accounted for brood-year differences in chum salmon age-at-maturity and lower returns in odd versus even years.

AB  - Structural damage in a bridge is defined as a significant deviation in the structural response from its standard operating conditions, not explainable by variations in external environmental and operational effects. However, environmental effects such as temperature fluctuations can cause significant seasonal variations in the structural response of a bridge and can mask its changes due to structural damage. This poses a challenge for structural health monitoring of bridges where reliable diagnosis of damage or deterioration is often related to isolation of the responses. To address it, a statistical damage-detection methodology is introduced where strain data are modelled using a dynamic harmonic regression time-series model. Prediction intervals of multi-step ahead forecasts from the dynamic harmonic regression model are then used as statistical control limits within which the observed phenomenon should fall under standard operating conditions. This single recursive structural health monitoring framework for automatic fitting and multi-step ahead forecasting of 1-min interval time-series strain data includes recorded temperature values and diurnal trends as regressors in the model to account for environmental variations. The potential of this method as a robust automatic structural health monitoring strategy is demonstrated on strain data sampled at 1-min interval from a full-scale damaged pre-stressed concrete bridge - before, during and after repair. The proposed method can capture both sudden and daily changes in structural response due to temperature effects, and a rolling multi-step ahead interval forecast was able to identify damage on back-cast data transitioning from a healthy state to a damaged state.

AB  - This study includes information about the most common freshwater and marine species from the genusCladophorasuch as classification, taxonomy and morphology, ecology, occurrence and distribution, population and community structure, harvesting and culture conditions, chemical composition, and utilization. Habitat requirements and development optima are different for species belonging to the commonly recorded genusCladophora. The majorityCladophoraspecies are distributed throughout the world, in both the moderate and tropical zones. Of the species noted from Europe, only 15 are characterized for freshwaters, both flowing and standing. In small water bodies, these green algae are very common and occur almost everywhere: in lakes, dam reservoirs, large rivers occur mainly in the coastal littoral zone. A commonly occurring species of macroscopic green algae isCladophora glomerata. Habitat parameters have shown that the distribution pattern of filamentous green algae taxa is determined by two different gradients: (i) depth-temperature, light availability, oxygen concentration; and (ii) trophy-nitrate and orthophosphate concentration. A fast growth rate ofCladophorais very effective under good light condition and high concentration of nutrients. Species of the generaCladophorahave been determined to be early spring or summer organisms. The biomass ofCladophoracan be successfully applied as a raw material for production of value-added products. In this review,Cladophoraspecies are discussed in terms of their chemical composition, as well as potential applications in many areas, for example human and animal health, agriculture (organic fertilizers, biostimulants of plant growth, feed additives), environmental protection (bioindicator of pollution/contamination, sorbent of pollutants from wastewater), renewable source of energy (biogas, bioethanol), and high-tech composite materials.

AB  - This study was conducted with the aim of investigating phosphorus release from pomace or solid olive waste in the presence of phosphorus solubilizing Pseudomonas bacteria. A multi-level factorial experiment with complete randomized design was employed in three replications. A calcareous soil was mixed with 2 and 4 g pomace per 100 g soil (W2 and W4, respectively) and inoculated with indicator and soil isolated Pseudomonas sp. (10(6) cell g(-1)) (Pf and Pi, respectively). Soil without pomace and Pseudomonads were also included as control (W0Pn). Mixtures incubated in sterile and non-sterile conditions for 4 months. Sampling was carried out at 0, 2, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 86 and 120 days and some soil biochemical properties were measured. The effects of pomace, bacteria, incubation time and their interactions were significant on pH, EC, basal respiration, organic carbon (OC), available phosphorus (P-ava) and phosphatase activity (p <= 0.01). Pomace increased soil OC content in both non-sterile and sterile conditions. The maximum amount of P-ava in non-sterile mixtures was observed in W4Pi (133.25 mg kg(-1)). Pomace and phosphorus solubilizing bacteria addition to soil increased phosphatase activity. Although P-ava concentration was highest in W4 treatments during the incubation period, its trend was ascending in W2 treatments. It seems that 2 g pomace per 100 g soil is enough for improving biological properties and phosphorus availability. Overall, the application of pomace with P-solubilizing bacteria can be a solution to increase soil available P level, reduce dependency on chemical P fertilizers and sustainable management of such solid wastes.

AB  - In this study, a geothermal power plant endowed with actual operational conditions and its equipment are evaluated using exergoenvironmental analysis from the perspective of environmental impact. Environmental impacts related to equipment (including construction, operation/maintenance and disposal), exergy destruction and pollution formation are taken into consideration. Moreover, effects of ambient temperature and brine input temperature with respect to environmental impact factors of the system are also discussed. Though this analysis, relative difference of specific environmental impacts, exergoenvironmental factor and total environmental impact are determined as 122% and 2.5% and 2285 Pts/h, respectively. The results of the study show that 98% of total environmental impact for the geothermal power plant is the cause of exergy destruction of the equipment involved. For this reason, improvement of exergetic efficiency for equipment should be considered rather than construction, operation/maintenance and disposal changes of system equipment. Hence, it is probably possible to have a higher capacity plant by getting a better condenser performance, as well as strengthening the vaporizers and the pumps. Besides, approximately 44 Pts/h of non-condensable gas-NCG (CO2 mostly) released from vaporizer to atmosphere caused environmental impact of the system to be measured as high environmental impact value of electricity equal to 0.108 Pts/kWh. In conclusion, conditions during which the ambient temperature decreases and brine input temperature increases, the system's environmental impacts concurrently decrease. This study is expected to serve as a guidework for researchers involved in environmental impacts of geothermal power plants and improvement of the plants in terms of environmental impact.

AB  - Quantitative estimates of crop growth for regionally dominant cropping systems are imperative for various agricultural applications. Here, we studied growth patterns for maize, soybean, sorghum, and winter wheat grown under optimal growing conditions in South-Central Nebraska during two growing seasons (2016-2017). The objectives were to measure and compare cropspecific growth indicators such as canopy height (CH), leaf area index (LAI) and aboveground biomass (AGB), crop growth rate (GR), relative growth rate (RGR) and their normalized (LAI per plant[LAIpP], LAI per canopy height[LAIpCH], AGB per plant [AGBpP], and AGB per canopy height [AGBpCH]), and integrative forms (net assimilation rate [NAR] and leaf area ratio [LAR]). Crop-specific sub-seasonal magnitudes and patterns were found, which were uniform across years. Crop growth indices were empirically modeled using heat accumulation (NCTU), owing to strong correlation (mostly R-2 > 0.80) and transferability. Sensitivity of biomass production between sampling events to heat accumulated between these events was quantified, which was higher for C4 crops (2.9-3.3 g m(-2) degrees C-1) than C3 crops (0.64-1.01 g m(-2) degrees C-1). Empirical models for estimating relatively complex growth indices were presented using indices such as CH and LAI. Moreover, LAR and RGR were highly correlated (R = 0.86) across all crops, while NAR and RGR were moderately correlated (R = 0.43), although substantial cropspecific variability existed among these indices. The data, comparisons and models presented are the first investigated values for these crops in Midwest under uniform conditions, and are valuable for applications in remote estimation of crop growth, crop models, crop resource use, and other related applications.

AB  - Salinity is one of the major abiotic environmental stress factors affecting plant growth and development. Centipedegrass (Eremochloa ophiuroides [Munro)] Hack.) is an important warm-season turfgrass species with low turf maintenance requirements, but is sensitive to salinity stress. To explore salt tolerant germplasms in centipedegrass and better understand the growth and physiological responses of centipedegrass to salinity, we conducted anatomic observation and phytochemical quantification, examined growth parameters, and investigated photosynthetic machinery and antioxidant system in two phenotypically distinct centipedegrass accessions under NaCl salt stress. The morphophenotypical difference of the stems in the two accessions mainly depends on whether or not a thickened epidermal horny layer with purple colour was formed, which was caused by anthocyanin accumulation in the tissue. Successive salinity treatment was found to result in an inhibition of leaf growth, a marked decrease in photosynthesis, chlorophyll contents, and the maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm). Under the same treatment, purple-stem accession (E092) showed a lower degree of inhibition or decrease than green-stem one (E092-1). With the exception of malondialdehyde level, both proline content and antioxidant enzymes were upregulated to a greater extent in E092 following exposure to salinity condition. Meanwhile, significant enhancements of anthocyanin accumulation and total protein synthesis were detected in E092 after salt treatment, but not in E092-1. These results demonstrated that E092 favor better accumulation of anthocyanins under salinity condition, which contribute to salt tolerance by adjusting physiological functions and osmotic balance, and better maintenance of high turf quality. Hence, genetic phenotype can be utilized as a key indicator in E. ophiuroides breeding for salt-tolerance.

AB  - The shelf life of pasteurized milk is generally determined through microbiological analysis. The objective of this study was to correlate microbial quality parameters then to design predictive models for shelf life of pasteurized milk. We analyzed pasteurized milk (3.9% fat) for aerobic plate counts (APCs), psychrotrophic bacteria counts (PBCs), and Bacillus spp. counts at 5, 7, 10, 13, 15, and 19 (1 degrees C) to the end of storage time. We also monitored titratable acidity, pH, and, lipase, and protease activity and correlated this with APC, which is the principal index defining shelf life. Results indicate that the shelf life of pasteurized milk was 24, 36, and 72 h at 19, 15, and 13 degrees C respectively, as determined by APC and acidity indicators. However, milk stored at lower temperatures of 5, 7, and 10 degrees C had longer shelf life of 30, 24, and 12 d, respectively. A sharp increase in titratable acidity, while decrease pH were observed when APCs reached 5.0 log(10) CFU/mL at all storage temperatures. Lipase and protease activities increased with storage temperature. At 5 and 7 degrees C, however, protease activity was very low. Therefore, we eliminated this parameter from our quality parameters as a potential spoilage indicator.
   Practical ApplicationFindings of this research are useful for monitoring the quality of commercial pasteurized milk, particularly in locations where environmental conditions make longer storage difficult. The study also provides valuable information for development of colorimetric shelf life indicators.

AB  - The brackish Bafa Lake located in the southwestern part of Turkey is under stress because of both natural and untreated wastewater effluents. The purpose of this research is to determine spatiotemporal distributions of some physicochemical variables in water column (temperature, salinity, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, NH4-N, NO2-N, NO3-N, oPO(4)-P, TPO4-P, chlorophyll-a, total suspended solids) and sediment (TN, TC, TOC, TP) and their relationships at coastal stations. In the water column, nitrate and phosphate concentrations showed seasonal variations with high values recorded in winter period. Ammonium was determined as a main source of TIN component. During summer period, a large amount of total phosphorus was found as dissolved organic form. However, in the winter period, inorganic phosphate levels increased at sampling stations. N limitation was a common feature throughout the lake where P-limitation was only observed in summer period. The total phosphorus levels which showed hypereutrophic condition at the western part of the lake changed between 1.55 and 4.99 mu M and did not remain in the range for uncontaminated condition. In the lake sediment, a strong relationship was found between TOC and TC levels. Generally, the mean TOC concentrations constitute small amount of TC values in the sampling stations. The results also indicated that a strong correlation exists between TOC and TN values, and TN was greatly regulated by organic sources. In the lake, TOC: TN ratios changed between 5 and 13; the ratio greater than 10 could be an indicator of algal and land plant sources mixing as an organic matter.

AB  - Antioxidative status, cellular metabolic stress and neurotransmitter enzyme assay as a pollution biomarker in Oreochromis mossambicus collected from Bhima river were investigated. O. mossambicus was collected from 18 different sites of Bhima river, which differ in their extent and type of contamination load. The antioxidative status were determined such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-s-transferase (GST) in the liver, gill, brain, gonad and kidney. All the studied parameters indicated potent signals for contamination of the aquatic water body. The antioxidative status was substantially high (p < 0.01) in the fish collected from Bhima river. The cellular stress enzymes such as lactate dehdrogenase (LDH), and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) in liver, gill, brain, gonad and muscle were remarkably (p < 0.01) elevated in O. mossambicus collected from Bhima river. The brain acetylcholine esterase (AChE) was noticeably inhibited (p < 0.01) whereas lipid peroxide (LPO) elevated in fish collected from a few sites. We also used morphological study as biomarkers indicators such as condition factor (CF), hepatosomatic index (HSI), gonadosomatic index (GSL). The results of condition factor and gonadosomatic index are significantly (p < 0.01) poor and hepatosomatic index was significantly (p < 0.01) elevated in O. mossambicus. The finding of the present investigation provides a rational application of oxidative stress, cellular stress, neurotransmitter, lipid peroxide and some morphological parameters to be used as biomarkers for biomonitoring the contamination of trace elements in polluted aquatic environment.

AB  - Given the large number of chemicals under regulatory scrutiny, models play a crucial role in the screening phase of the environmental risk assessment. The sewage treatment plant (STP) model SimpleTreat 3.1 is routinely applied as part of the European Union System for the Evaluation of Substances to estimate the fate and elimination of organic chemicals discharged via sewage. SimpleTreat estimates tend to be conservative and therefore only useful for lower-tier assessments. A probabilistic version of SimpleTreat was built on the updated version of the model (SimpleTreat 3.2, presented in a parallel article in this issue), embracing likeliest as well as worst-case conditions in a statistically robust way. Probabilistic parameters representing the variability of sewage characteristics, STP design, and operational parameters were based on actual STP conditions for activated sludge plants in Europe. An evaluation study was carried out for 4 chemicals with distinct sorption and biodegradability profiles: tonalide, triclosan, trimethoprim, and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate. Simulations incorporated information on biodegradability simulation studies with activated sludge (OECD 314B and OECD 303A tests). Good agreement for both median values and variability ranges was observed between model estimates and monitoring data. The uncertainty analysis highlighted the importance of refined data on partitioning and biodegradability in activated sludge to achieve realistic estimates. The study indicates that the best strategy to refine the exposure assessment of down-the-drain chemicals is by integrating higher-tier laboratory data with probabilistic STP simulations and, if possible, by comparing them with monitoring data for validation.

AB  - Concentration of heavy and toxic metals Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb and Hg were determined in liver and muscles of Rutilus frisii kutum and their relationships with growth parameters (length, age, condition factor) and hepatosomatic index were examined. Thirty-six fish samples were collected from February through March 2009 caught by beach seine in the southwest parts of the Caspian Sea. Atomic absorption and Hg determined concentrations of Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu by vapor method. Cadmium was recorded only in liver samples. Range of other metals in muscle tissue were ND -0.591, 0.001-0.013, 11-26 and 0.729 -7.261 mu g.g(-1)dw for Pb, Hg, Zn and Cu respectively. Highest levels of Pb, Zn, and Cu were recorded in muscles Hg and Cd in liver samples. Growth parameters showed a significant relationship with Zn and Cd concentrations in liver samples and only Zn concentrations in muscle samples. There was a positive significant correlation between concentration of Cd in liver and physiological indices (p<0.05). Although higher concentration of Pb was recorded in this study in comparison to previous studies, based on Provisional Tolerable Weekly and daily Intake of fish for human health, kutum is considered safe for human consumption. Considering the results of this study it seems reproductive status of the fish influences heavy metals concentration in liver and muscles of kutum and therefore concentrations of some metals such as Zn and Cu in liver samples may not be a reliable bioindicator for environmental pollution.

AB  - A study to characterize the distribution of vehicle related air pollution in proximity to a major arterial road was undertaken to inform local land use planning and policy regarding separation distances that could help reduce exposure for new sensitive land use development. Measurements of criteria air contaminants were made at ground level, 10 m, 30 m, and 60 m from curb side, and at 9 m height, 10 m from curb side along a traffic corridor carrying over 34,000 vehicles per day. Pollutant decay with distance or height was not statistically significant for 03, CO, or SO2. No clear distance decay pattern emerged for PM2.5. Compared to concentrations at ground level 30 m from curb side, concentrations at 10 m, 60 m, and 10 m at 9 m height were 83%, 45% and 54% higher, respectively. For NO, NO2, and NOx, however, there was a statistically significant decline in concentrations with distance with the decay most apparent from 30 m to 60 m from the road. Concentrations at 10 m from curb side at 9 m height were equivalent to (all wind conditions) or less than (downwind conditions) those at 30 m and ground level. These findings suggest that for protection of public health in the near road environment, vertical distance is an important determinant of exposure to pollutants that are key indicators of traffic related air pollution. This has implications for sensitive land use development in proximity to high volume traffic corridors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Leaf water potential (LWP) is an important indicator of plant water status. However, its determination via classical pressure-chamber measurements is tedious and time-consuming. Moreover, such methods cannot easily account for rapid changes in this parameter arising from changes in environmental conditions. Spectrometric measurements, by contrast, have the potential for fast and non-destructive measurements of plant water status, but are not unproblematic. Spectral characteristics of plants vary across plant development stages and are also influenced by environmental factors. Thus, it remains unclear whether changes in leaf water potential per se can reliably be detected spectrometrically or whether such measurements also reflect autocorrelated changes in the leaf water content (LWC) or the aerial plant biomass. We tested the accuracy of spectrometric measurements in this context under controlled climate chamber conditions in series of six experiments that minimised perturbing influences but allowed for significant changes in the LWP. Short-term exposure of dense stands of plants to increasing or decreasing artificial light intensities in a growth chamber more markedly decreased LWP than LWC in both wheat and maize. Significant relationships (R-2-values 0.74-0.92) between LWP and new spectral indices ((R-940/R-960)/NDVI; R-940/R-960) were detected with or without significant changes in LWC of both crop species. The exact relationships found, however, were influenced strongly by the date of measurement or water stress induced. Thus, global spectral relationships measuring LWP probably cannot be established across plant development stages. Even so, spectrometric measurements supplemented by a reduced calibration dataset from pressure chamber measurements might still prove to be a fast and accurate method for screening large numbers of diverse lines.

AB  - In many species, reproductive success, resistance to food shortage and immune response to parasitism depend on body nutrient reserves. Thus, determining body fuels is important for studying the impact of the environment on animal fitness. As an alternative to the usual biochemical methods, we have defined models for estimating body composition in rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). The accuracy of the indices obtained on a source group was tested on an independent group. The models were applicable regardless of age, sex or season. The intact body mass already accounted for 90% of the protein variability. The most accurate equation combining dry body mass and interscapular fat mass explained 99% of the protein variations. Intact body mass and the kidney fat index were poor estimators of lipid stores (r(2) = 0.45) but 90% of the variation was explained by an equation combining the interscapular fat mass and the hind leg length. None of the predictive equations significantly over- or underestimated body reserves. The usefulness of the models was assessed by estimating fasting endurance during winter. Individual estimates, ranging from two to eight days, did not differ by more than 0.5 day from the fasting endurance obtained from actual mobilisable body nutrients. In such lean species ( adiposity 2 - 4%), proteins may account for up to 40% of the available energy reserves and survival is likely to be linked to the continuous availability of food resources. These results stress the need to determine proteins and not only lipids to have a pertinent tool for the management of wild animal populations, particularly in lean species.

AB  - State-and-transition models are increasingly being used to guide rangeland management. These models provide a relatively simple, management-oriented way to classify land condition (state) and to describe the factors that might cause a shift to another state (a transition). There are many formulations of state-and-transition models in the literature. The version we endorse does not adhere to any particular generalities about ecosystem dynamics, but it includes consideration of several kinds of dynamics and management response to them. In contrast to previous uses of state-and-transition models, we propose that models can, at present, be most effectively used to specify and qualitatively compare the relative benefits and potential risks of different management actions (e.g., fire and grazing) and other factors (e.g., invasive species and climate change) on specified areas of land. High spatial and temporal variability and complex interactions preclude the meaningful use of general quantitative models. Forecasts can be made on a case-by-case basis by interpreting qualitative and quantitative indicators, historical data, and spatially structured monitoring data based on conceptual models. We illustrate how science- based conceptual models are created using several rangeland examples that vary in complexity. In doing so, we illustrate the implications of designating plant communities and states in models, accounting for varying scales of pattern in vegetation and soils, interpreting the presence of plant communities on different soils and dealing with our uncertainty about how those communities were assembled and how they will change in the future. We conclude with observations about how models have helped to improve management decision-making.

It is undergoing rapid transformation, which has severe implications for human settlement in and around the lagoon and the socio-economic condition of the state. Monitoring of these transformations has been undertaken through satellite remote sensing techniques as well as field observations in order to develop spectral signatures for coastal lagoonal features such as water types, turbidity and vegetation types. IRS 1B LISS - 1 digital data on 07-12-93, 11-10.94, 29-01-95, 27-04-95, 10-07-96 and 23-05-98 have been used. Digital image analysis has been carried out using the IBM RS 6000 Image Analysis System having V6.1 EASI/PACE software. Maximum likelihood classification has been used to classify the lagoon where ground truth observations have been integrated with the remote sensing data. The lagoon has been classified into different classes varying from a minimum of 9 categories during January 1995 to a maximum of 15 classes during July 1996. The time rate of change of different classes has been studied by estimating their area, which suggests that the vegetation growth in the lagoon is alarming. Algorithms have also been applied for developing different lagoonal indices which act as indicators of ecological changes. Two equations, predicting depth and total suspended solid concentration, have been validated with observed data.

AB  - Feedlot cattle consuming large amounts of feed and gaining weight rapidly generate significant amounts of metabolic heat. In summer, failure to dissipate this heat leads to heat accumulation and heat stress. Respiratory rates, panting scores, and behavioral changes are useful indicators of heat stress in cattle. Ceasing cattle movement, providing supplementary water tanks in the pens, cooling the pen surface, and manipulation of nutrition and feeding management should be considered to mitigate the risk and manage a heat stress crisis. Removing manure from the pens and provisions of shade have been found to be beneficial for cattle exposed to hot climates.

AB  - A highway network is valuable for the society it serves, and should be maintained so as to keep this value at an optimum level. This study was performed to contribute to the planning of highway pavement maintenance work, associated with the Pavement Management System application in Turkish State Highways. In this study, pavement performance was modeled, taking into consideration traffic loads, environmental conditions, and the longitudinal evenness value which is accepted as the pavement performance indicator by the General Directorate of Highways in Turkey. Then, using this model, it is planned to estimate the total maintenance costs (per lane-km) of Turkish State Highways according to maintenance year and type.

AB  - Accessibility has become a key issue in modern urban planning. This paper aims to identify the impact of differences in spatial accessibility on the development of the built environment in cities. Using a few simple accessibility indicators, it tries to map out in a quantitative way the detailed implications of accessibility conditions for built-up areas, on the basis of a 25 m x 25 m grid cell approach. The statistical tool used here is logistic regression, followed by a GIS representation of the empirical results for four Dutch cities: Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam, and Utrecht.

AB  - An increase of water temperature due to global warming is expected to be stressful for many aquatic species such as cold-water fishes. Otolith asymmetry is known to be a proxy of fish stress. However, Cottus gobio Linnaeus, 1758 inhabiting potentially stressing (i.e. warm) thermal conditions did not present a higher level of asymmetry in their otoliths than other ones. Local adaptations to thermal stress of the different populations studied or a weak a priori definition of the thermal tolerance of this species are discussed.

AB  - The marine Miocene (Serravallian) deposits of El Camp de Tarragona (Catalonia, Spain) have yielded many specimens of the rosetted trace fossil Dactyloidites ottoi (GEINITZ). The features that they show allow to recognize that D. ottoi is an endogenic feeding trace fossil with a central shaft and several branched radial elements with protrusive spreiten. The sedimentary environment where the rocks hosting the trace were deposited in the studied outcrop, is very similar to those of other localities where the icknospecies has been founded formerly. So, D. ottoi can be considered a good facies indicator for shallow marine, energetic environments, usually in warm climatic conditions.

The clinopyroxenes under study were compared with megacryst clinopyroxenes in basalts and minerals in their deep-seated xenoliths and clinopyroxenes in lamproites and minettes. the coexisting clinopyroxene-pyrope pair was studied. Besides the author also studied the origin of clinopyroxenes in kimberlites, P-T conditions for their formation and their reflected tectonic environments of the kimberlite formation. He suggests that this mineral is an indicator for diamond exploration.

KW  - TOURISM DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Rural ecotourism has become an important development trend, and it is also an important engine to promote rural revitalization. The focus of rural ecotourism development is to select characteristic tourism resource points. These days in China Tourism Resource Classification, Survey and Evaluation (GB/T18972-2003) is the national standard used to determine the level of rural tourism resources. However, this standard can only provide the types and grades of benchmarking resources mechanically; it cannot determine the value of or give a ranking for the core resource points of rural ecotourism, and has no practical significance for the further development of rural tourism products. At present, the relevant research literature focuses mainly on the economic value of tourism resources and the development strategy and mode of tourism resources, while there is less quantitative analysis of the evaluation of tourism resources elements. Based on a review of relevant literature and an interpretation of China's national standards, this paper sorts out the core evaluation indicators for rural ecotourism, and constructs an evaluation system of rural ecotourism resources at three levels: target level, factor level and evaluation index level. The importance of each index in the evaluation system is sorted by using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the Decision Alternative Ratia Evaluation System (DARE) and the Delphi method. The results show that human cultural conditions and natural conditions are the core elements of rural ecotourism resources, and the importance of natural scenery and cultural objects are most prominent. The research results can provide significant evidence and references for the evaluation of characteristic tourism resources and the creation of characteristic tourism products in future rural ecotourism planning.

AB  - Hematological and biochemical reference intervals are an important tool for health assessment and treatment decision-making in veterinary medicine. Lack of information about reference intervals (RI) in mules force professionals to apply reference intervals developed for horses or donkeys, with the risk of misinterpretation. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine hematological and biochemical RI for healthy mules and compare them with those proposed in literature for horses, donkeys and mules. A total of 142 healthy mules (mixed breed mares x Baudet du Poitou) of both sex, all between 7 and 22 years of age and between 290 and 500 kg of live weight were sampled and 32 blood parameters analyzed in order to calculate reference intervals according to the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) and the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standards. The values obtained for Chilean mules were within the RI in three of the 21 variables where data was available for UK donkeys and for three of 22 RI available for working horses in Pakistan; no similarities were found with those from Portuguese mules. In the case of Chilean working horses RI, mules values were within range for 11 of 25 variables. The differences found in blood biochemistry may be explained by husbandry conditions, diet, type of work and biological features. Differences between mules' reference intervals and those from donkeys and working horses highlight the importance of having specific reference values for this equid hybrid and the need to develop further research in mules under different working conditions and genetic background.

AB  - In this communication results of an ecological study of soil Oribatida from Northern Tripura, India have been incorporated. Soil samples were collected fortnightly from two sites over a period of one year (July 2016 to June 2017). An attempt has been made to determine the extent to which macro vegetation, edaphic variables and local microclimatic conditions influence the community structure of Oribatida. Among the 14 species under 12 genera identified, species of the genera Scheloribates, Protoribates and Galumna were the major contributors representing 34.27%, 16.93% and 7.58% of the total population, respectively. Species of Scheloribates and Protoribates were common and dominated in both sites. The oribatid abundance exhibited an irregular and significant trend of fluctuation with a maximum in winter and a minimum in the monsoon period. Out of four edaphic variables analyzed, only the organic matter content and pH showed a positive and significant correlation with oribatid abundance, while temperature and moisture revealed a significant negative correlation. It was interesting to note that although the study sites were close to each other and were more or less similar in topological, edaphological and climatological conditions, with a little variation in distance and vegetation cover they exhibited variations in both oribatid species abundance and diversity. The reason behind the seasonal variation and differences in abundance and species diversity in the studied sites was highlighted. Further extensive and comprehensive research on oribatids is needed in the region of Tripura.

AB  - Several previous studies have investigated the use of the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions in plant materials as indicators of palaeoclimate. However, accurate interpretation relies on a detailed understanding of both physiological and environmental drivers of the variations in isotopic enrichments that occur in leaf water and associated organic compounds. To progress this aim we measured delta O-18 and delta H-2 values in eucalypt leaf and stem water and delta O-18 values in leaf cellulose, along with the isotopic compositions of water vapour, across a north-eastern Australian aridity gradient. Here we compare observed leaf water enrichment, along with previously published enrichment data from a similar north Australian transect, to Craig-Gordon-modelled predictions of leaf water isotopic enrichment. Our investigation of model parameters shows that observed O-18 enrichment across the aridity gradients is dominated by the relationship between atmospheric and internal leaf water vapour pressure while H-2 enrichment is driven mainly by variation in the water vapour-source water isotopic disequilibrium. During exceptionally dry and hot conditions (RH < 21%, T > 37 A degrees C) we observed strong deviations from Craig-Gordon predicted isotope enrichments caused by partial stomatal closure. The atmospheric-leaf vapour pressure relationship is also a strong predictor of the observed leaf cellulose delta O-18 values across one aridity gradient. Our finding supports a wider applicability of leaf cellulose delta O-18 composition as a climate proxy for atmospheric humidity conditions during the leaf growing season than previously documented.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of handling, confinement and crowding on HSP70 production in an intertidal crab. HSP70 has been widely used as a biochemical indicator of thermal stress; however studies on the effect of experimental conditions and handling on HSP70 expression are very scarce. The response of marbled crab. Pachygrapsus marrnoratus, collected in the Portuguese coast, was investigated through an experiment in captivity, where 42 juveniles (10-19 mm of carapace width) were confined in an experimental container (60 x 42 x 10 cm) and exposed to three treatments: 1) increasing temperatures and periodic handling, 2) only to periodic handling and 3) no handling, for 12 h. The objective of this work was to investigate whether the HSP70 production measured in an increasing temperature experiment is a response to temperature alone or whether manipulation, confinement and crowding during the experiment also increase HSP70 production. Three individuals were sampled after t = 0, t = 4, t = 6, t = 8, t = 10 and t = 12 h, for the quantification of HSP70 production in the hemolymph, in the three trials. It was concluded that while temperature has a significant effect on HSP70 production, periodic handling does not, nor does confinement to the experimental container or crowding. It can thus be concluded that experimental conditions and handling are not parasitic variables in experiments with this species considering increasing temperatures. P. marmoratus can thus be used as a model species in climate warming experiments involving handling, confinement and crowding. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The lesser kestrel Falco naumanni is a globally threatened colonial bird that has suffered a generalized population decline in Europe. Recent studies have suggested that the land-use changes linked to agriculture intensification are the main factors accounting for the population regression. However, there has been little analysis of the role of pesticide applications. In this study, we examined the consequences of a malathion treatment in a wild population of lesser kestrels, specifically its effects on breeding performance, adult survival and population size. We found that the larger the area treated with malathion around the colony, the lower the size and the body condition of the fledglings, although no effects were found on the number of fledged chicks per pair or their sex ratio. Survival of adult males, but not females, was lower in the malathion-treated areas. These results show that organophosphorus pesticides applied at standard rates might disrupt the lesser kestrel population dynamics by reducing their breeding performance and increasing adult mortality in a sex-biased way. The proportional area treated around the colony did not affect colony size in the following year, indicating that an increased adult male mortality was not enough to lead to a detectable population size reduction and/or that the arrival of immigrants could have masked it. Both the direct malathion toxic effects and the expected reduction in prey availability due to fumigation are likely to underlie the observed effects. Hence, keeping non-treated buffer areas around kestrel colony centers should be a strictly applied conservation measure to avoid the observed negative side effects of malathion applications.

AB  - Forest litter and soil may contain >10 X 10(6) individual nematodes center dot m(-2) and, regionally, >400 species. Root-feeding nematodes may be pathogenic to young plants; microbial-feeding nematodes may increase turnover of the microbial pool; predacious and omnivorous nematodes represent higher trophic levels. The spatial distribution and abundance of nematode species in forests reflect soil type, soil fertility, climate, canopy and understorey plant species, litter depth, forest age, and management. Nematodes may be important in forest nurseries; they occur throughout the rooting depth of forest trees; hyphal-feeding species may influence mycorrhizae; and insect-vectored Bursaphelenchus species are a quarantine risk. Nematode populations interact with those of other soil animals (e.g., mites, tardigrades, enchytraeids, and protozoa). The diversity and abundance of the nematode assemblage make nematodes a useful indicator of soil condition and soil processes. Information available from forest systems suggests that, as long as physical disturbance is minimized and remaining trees or herb layer moderate the microclimate, logging and other forestry operations have only transitory effects on nematode populations. Extreme disturbance, such as bulldozing and slash-and-burn management, can significantly reduce nematode abundance and diversity. In contrast, management that enhances growth of understorey or herb layer can stimulate nematode populations. Each of these changes can be related to changes in food resource availability and environmental conditions, such as soil temperature and moisture. Although details of soil nematode contributions to nutrient processes in forest soils are sparse, that their populations are maintained through cycles of moderate management practices suggest that their beneficial contributions will also be maintained.

AB  - Quahog parasite unknown (QPX) is a protistan parasite that causes significant mortalities among hard clams. Mercenaria mercenaria, in the northeastern United States and Canada. This pathogen has been successfully isolated from clams from different geographic locations, and ill vitro cultures are being used in investigations of the parasite's genetic makeup, virulence and environmental tolerances. Many of these investigations require an easily reproducible, quantitative method to rapidly measure QPX cell viability and proliferation. Therefore, a fluorometric microplate technique was developed using fluorescein diacetate (FDA) as an indicator of cell viability. The developed technique provides a good estimate of the biovolume of live QPX cells. Fluorescent signals are correlated with the number and the size of individual QPX cells. Optimal experimental conditions included an FDA concentration range of 30-50 mu M with an incubation period of 15-30 min in the dark. This FDA assay was used to investigate the dynamics of ill vitro growth of QPX. Results showed that the growth dynamic is different among QPX isolates. For instance, exponential growth lasted for 1 week in two QPX isolates cultured from clams collected from New York and Massachusetts: whereas a third isolate (from New York) grew exponentially during 2 weeks under similar experimental conditions. While there are limitations to ill vitro studies that must be recognized, research using cultured QPX cells is indispensable and will probably lead to significant progress ill our knowledge of the biology and physiology of this parasite.

AB  - Seedling emergence from soil seed bank was studied during 3 growing seasons 1997-1999 in: 1) 60 plots in 3 parts of the Potentillo albae-Quercetum patch: A - with Carpinus betulus (hornbeam) present only in the herb layer (canopy cover ca. 50-60%), B - after tree felling, at present with hornbeam dominating the shrub layer (cover > 90%), C - invaded by hornbeam 30-40 years ago (cover ca. 90%), and in 2) 60 soil samples from objects A, B, C kept in an unheated glasshouse. The results suggest that the seed bank realised in natural conditions is poorer in species with high light requirements (the Ellenberg indicator values for light (L greater than or equal to 6) and their seedlings in comparison with the potential seed bank estimated in glasshouse conditions (field: A - 24; B - 17; C - 7, glasshouse : 44; 38; 32 species / 2 m(2), field: 321; 108; 14, glasshouse: 785; 1205; 177 seedlings / m(2), respectively). Contrarily, more species and seedlings with moderate light demand (L = 3-5) appeared in the field plots (field: A - 26; B - 25, glasshouse: 20; 14 species / 2 m(2), field: 1014; 310, glasshouse: 328; 71 seedlings / m(2)). The shading by hornbeam negatively influences the size of the seed bank (field: A - 1743; B - 1226; C 680, glasshouse: 1547; 3274; 459 seedlings / m(2)) and its species richness (field: A - 55; B - 48; C - 19, glasshouse: 76; 59; 56 taxa / 2 m(2)).

AB  - Chemostats were used to study the effects of carbon and nitrogen limitation and specific growth rate on 16S rRNA synthesis and cellular fatty acid (CFA) profiles in four human intestinal bacteria (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Clostridium bifermentans and Cl. difficile). Cellular fatty acid synthesis varied with dilution rate and nutrient availability in different species, but these cellular constituents were relatively stable phenotypic characteristics in Bact. thetaiotaomicron, where branched chain and hydroxy CFA were good taxonomic markers. Conversely, CFA in the Gram-positive bacteria varied markedly with changes in growth environment. For example, in chemostats, cyclopropane CFA were only synthesized in Cl. bifermentans and Cl. difficile under N-limited conditions. Similarly, Dimethyl acetal (DMA) fatty acids in Bif. adolescentis were primarily produced during N-limited growth, and this was inversely related to dilution rate. At low growth rates, 16S rRNA concentrations (mug rRNA per ml culture) correlated with viable bacterial counts, but were more closely related to specific growth rate when expressed as a function of cell mass (mug rRNA per mg dry weight bacteria). However, this did not reveal differences in bacterial population size and rRNA concentration in C-limited cultures. Thus, at low dilution rates, C limitation strongly reduced rRNA synthesis in Cl. bifermentans, despite viable cell counts being similar to those in N-limited cultures. These results indicate that, while 16S rRNA is a useful indicator of microbial activity, cell growth rate does not necessarily relate to rRNA concentration under all nutritional conditions. Consequently, bowel habit and diet will affect both CFA and rRNA content in bacteria isolated from intestinal samples, and this should be taken into consideration when interpreting such data measurements.

AB  - Coastal marshes are important blue carbon reservoirs, but it is unclear how vegetation shifts associated with tidal restoration and sea level rise alter soil microbial respiration rates and bacterial community composition. Within 20 Connecticut salt marshes (10 without tidal restrictions, 10 tidally restored), we sampled three vegetation zones dominated by Spartina alterniflora (short-form, < 30 cm tall), S. patens, and Phragmites australis to estimate microbial respiration rates (SIR, substrate-induced respiration; carbon mineralization), root zone bacterial 16S rRNA genes, and a suite of plant and soil characteristics. Carbon density was greater in unrestricted marshes than tidally restored marshes and was the only parameter that differed among sites with varying restoration histories. We observed strong differences among vegetation zones, with vegetation being a top predictor of both SIR and carbon mineralization. Electrical conductivity (EC) was also a top predictor for SIR, and we observed strong, positive correlations between EC and both metrics of microbial respiration, with elevated rates in more frequently inundated S. alterniflora than P. australis zones. We also observed distinct root zone microbial communities associated with vegetation zones, with greater abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria in Spartina spp. zones. Our findings suggest that dominant salt marsh vegetation zones are useful indicators of hydrologic conditions and could be used to estimate microbial respiration rates; however, it is still unclear whether differences in microbial respiration and community composition among vegetation zones are driven by plant community, environmental conditions, or their interactions.

AB  - PM2.5 and ozone (O-3) are two major pollutants that are worsening air quality in China. Using Guangzhou as a case study, we analyzed the meteorological data and air quality data for 2014-2016 obtained by 4 weather stations and 10 environmental monitoring stations, respectively, and assessed the influence of significant meteorological parameters on the hourly PM2.5 concentration and the daily maximum 8-hour-averaged (MDA8) O-3 concentration. Calculating each factor's critical values for these concentrations, we found that the hourly PM2.5 concentration tended to increase when the relative humidity was > 50%, the hourly rainfall intensity was <= 0.6 mm hour(-1), or the wind speed was <= 1.8 m s(-1) but otherwise decreased, whereas the MDA8 O-3 concentration tended to increase when the sunshine duration was > 4 hours, the maximum temperature was > 29 degrees C, or the average daily wind speed was <= 1.8 m s(-1) but otherwise decreased. The wind direction was also a crucial factor, as Guangzhou typically experienced severe air pollution when westerlies prevailed. Applying the critical values of these various meteorological parameters as indicators of air quality, we discovered that the least favorable weather conditions during the study period occurred in 2014. These results further our understanding of the relationship between weather conditions and pollutant concentrations. Following the novel approach proposed in this study, meteorological parameters can be utilized to forecast the air quality or compare the effects of weather on pollution between different years.

AB  - The main condition for personal and mental development of a child is preservation of speech function or, in case of speech pathology, correction and development of all its structural components as a full-fledged means of communication. The purpose of the study is to scientifically substantiate, develop and experimentally test psychological and pedagogical conditions and methods of formation of speech activity in children with autistic disorders of older preschool age. There were highlighted effective methods for speech activity formation: creation and maintenance of a speech environment; constant speech support of a child; teaching a child to express thoughts in any way possible; use of stimulants and incentives in order to increase motivation for speech activity; use of available child's vocalizations; use of echolalia and a tendency to stereotypical repetition of actions; stimulation of speech activity against the background of emotional recovery; development of speech activity by imitation; activation of passive vocabulary and its gradual translation into active; fostering initiative and desire for self-realization. The indicators of the formation level of speech activity components in EG compared with CG, respectively, are: motivation: high not found, sufficient: + 8.6%, average: + 19%, low: + 14.3%, zero - 41.9%; initiative: high not found, sufficient: + 10.7%, medium: + 13.8%, low: + 9.5%, zero - 34%; content: high: + 4.3%, sufficient: + 17.6%, medium: + 12.9%, low: - 27.3%, zero - 7.5%. The best indicators were achieved by children of the experimental group, which gives reason to assert the effectiveness and feasibility of using the proposed methodology for formation of speech activity in the process of correctional developmental education of children with autistic disorders.

AB  - The article considers the phenomenon of soil cover spatial heterogeneity and its influence on the lands productivity of the Right-Bank Forest-Steppe of Ukraine. The basic patterns of existence and functioning of micro-depressions (potholes) on chernozem soils, directly on the agricultural fields of the research farm "Velikosnitinske" in Kiev region are determined. It has been found that one of the most important reasons of vegetation and crop yields variegation of the experimental farm field crop rotations is that microrelief elements of various shapes and depths are common here. The main factor affecting soils and vegetation is the water regime of such micro-depressions, which differs significantly from the water regime of lowland territories. Depending on the redistribution of atmospheric moisture over the topography of the field, the agroecological condition, properties and biological activity of the soil, the physiological state of the plants vary changing indicators of the size and quality of the crop. UAV (drones), GPS-receiver and satellite images Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, internet weather service rp5 were the instruments for studying the dynamics of the water regime of micro-depressions and the state of vegetation. It was determined that the uneven distribution of moisture in agrolandscapes leads to the formation of various soil differences and has a significant effect on crop formation and the duration of the growing season of crops. Research results can be used in precision farming and in compiling detailed soil maps. It is proposed to use the identified patterns in the development of technologies for growing crops under conditions of spatial heterogeneity of the water regime of soils.

AB  - There are limited reports about the impacts of long-term cropping and land-use systems (CLUS) on soil properties and nutrient stocks under smallholder farmers' conditions in developing countries. The objective of this research was to examine variation in soil properties and OC and TN stocks across the different CLUS in Dura sub-catchment, northern Ethiopia. Surveys and discussions on field history were used to identify nine CLUS, namely, tef (Eragrostis tef (Zucc) Trot)) mono-cropping (TM), maize (Zea mays L.) mono-cropping (MM), cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis)-maize intercropping (IC1), red beet (Beta Vulgaris)-maize intercropping (IC2), cauliflower-tef-maize rotation (R1), onion (Allium cepa L.)-maize-onion rotation (R2), tr eated gully (TG), untreated gully (UTG), and natural forest system (NF). A total of 27 composite soil samples were randomly collected from the CLUS for soil analysis. Data were subjected to one-way analysis of variance and PCA. The lowest and highest bulk density was determined from NF (1.19 Mg m(-3)) and UTG (1.77 Mg m-3), respectively. Soil pH, EC and CEC varied significantly among the CLUS. The highest CEC (50.3 cmol(c) kg(-1)) was reported under TG followed by NF. The highest soil OC stock (175.3 Mg C ha(-1)) and TN stock (13.6 Mg C ha(-1)) were found from NF. The PCA chosen soil properties explained 87% of the soil quality variability among the CLUS. Such soil properties and nutrient stocks variability among the CLUS suggested that introduction of suitable management practices that sustain the soil system of the CLUS with poor soil properties and nutrient stocks are crucial for the study area conditions.

AB  - Due to the environmental concerns and new energy policies, worldwide expectations for energy production utilizing photovoltaic (PV) systems are increasing significantly. The aluminum electrolytic capacitor (AEC) is extensively used in filtering application for power electronic converters in PV systems since they can achieve the highest energy density with the lowest cost. However, the lifetime of an AEC is limited due to the electrolyte vaporization. The degradation of AECs challenges the efficiency and reliability of a PV system. Therefore, the health-monitoring of AECs is indispensable for the PV systems to operate reliably. In this paper, an online AEC-monitoring scheme based on magnetic-field sensing is proposed for PV systems under various working conditions. The AEC-monitoring technique using the equivalent series resistance (ESR) and capacitance (C) as the health indicators were developed for the power electronic converters in PV systems. The proposed methodology considering the voltage drops on C can improve the accuracy in ESR-estimation and achieve the estimation of C. The simulation results with Simulink verified that the proposed method was capable of estimating the health indicators accurately over various levels of solar irradiance and ambient temperature. The tunneling magnetoresistive (TMR) sensors were pre-calibrated from -25 to 100 degrees C for implementation in PV systems. The experimental results proved that TMR sensors could measure the current of AECs effectively to achieve the precise estimations of the health indicators using the proposed technique. This technique is non-invasive, compact, and cost-effective since it can be realized with the TMR sensors or other MR sensors.

AB  - Brazilian coastal zone comprises more than 8,000 km of extension, which together with the tropical climate, increase the interest of the coastal tourism in the coastal zone. Consequently, the demand for services in coastal cities, such as basic sanitation, is also increasing. In this way, the evaluation of the beach waters quality is of great relevance, since the contact with contaminated water can raise the exposure to pathogenic microorganisms and with this the transmission of waterborne diseases. The objective of this study was to evaluate the balneability of two beaches (Enseada and Sao Lourenco, municipality of Bertioga, Sao Paulo State, SP, Brazil) using sanitary conditions as indicators. The soil coverture and sanitary sewage system were related to the quality of the beach waters. For the analyzed period (2010 to 2016) a direct correlation (R = 0.58 and R = 0.46) was observed between the monitoring stations balneability using the criteria of the "Conselho Nacional do Meio Ambiente" (National Council of the Environment) CONAMA 274/2000 and the World Health Organization, respectively, and the index of the sanitary sewage system for the region, similarly, the coefficient of determination (R-2) presented values of 0.34 and 0.21. The results of the applied methodology allowed a satisfactory evaluation of the water quality of selected beaches and suggested that the Sao Lourenco beach has a better sanitary sewage system and, consequently, a better bathing water quality and lower risks to the bathers health, while the Enseada Beach presented regular indices due to the lack of a sewage collection system in most of this settlement area.

AB  - The coals and coal-bearing mangrove sediments of Sandakan Formation have been evaluated for their source rock potential, paleoredox conditions and source of organic input, as well as the age and paleovegetation distribution using geochemical and petrographical methods. The studied samples were generally rich in organic carbon, which varied from 0.60 (massive mudstone) to 62.37 wt% (coal). The studied samples have vitrinite reflectance (R-o) ranging from 0.31 to 0.49% and Tmax values ranging from 353 to 436 degrees C indicating an immature to very early mature stage for hydrocarbon generation. The sediments were dominated by Type III kerogen, with some Type II/Ill kerogen, suggesting a significant land plant contribution to the organic matter. The bimodal distribution displayed by gas chromatogram, with a clear odd/even carbon number and skewed to higher molecular weight carbon (nC(31)), Indicating a transitional depositional environment. The variation in pristane/phytane ratio, varied from 0.71 to 2.97, suggesting an alternating anoxic and oxic deposition conditions. The presence of marine dinoflagellate cyst in the mangrove and offshore mudstones were consistent with the relatively higher sulphur content in the studied samples which indicate marine inundations.
   Palynomorph recovered in this study, with abundant mangrove and freshwater types of pollen, suggesting a biogeographical distribution of ancient mangrove vegetation that expanded landward into the freshwater peat swamp setting and hinterland. The presence of marker species, viz. Florschuetzia levipoli, F. meridionalis and F. semilobata delineated an Early Miocene to Middle Miocene age for the Sandakan sediments.

AB  - A new enzymatic assay method that uses deconjugation enzymes was developed to evaluate the presence and extent of conjugated pharmaceuticals in the form of glucuronide conjugates or sulphate conjugates in river environments. First, acetaminophen glucuronide (Ace Glu) and acetaminophen sulphate (Ace Sul) were used as model conjugated pharmaceuticals to determine the appropriate combination of deconjugation enzymes and reaction conditions, including temperature, duration and pH. Next, we applied the defined method to 19 pharmaceuticals grouped into nine therapeutic classes that were chosen based on previously detected levels and frequencies in sewage and river water. The enzymatic decomposition profile varied widely depending upon the enzyme preparations available. The effect of the water reaction temperature was small between 5 and 40 degrees C, and the reaction proceeded in for both glucuronide conjugates and sulphate conjugates at an approximately neutral pH (corresponding to usual river water conditions) within 1 h. Application of the method to environmental samples showed that some pharmaceuticals were present in both glucuronide conjugate and sulphate conjugated forms, although glucuronide conjugates were the primary forms in the river water environment. Water treatment systems at sewage treatment plants were found to be effective for the removal of these conjugated compounds. The present results should be valuable in the environmental risk assessment of conjugated pharmaceuticals and in keeping river environments clean. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that enables the evaluation of the pharmaceutical deconjugation potential in a river environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Despite the importance of nitric oxide (NO) in vascular physiology and pathology, a high-throughput method for the quantification of its vascular generation is lacking. Objective: By using the fluorescent probe 4-amino-5-methylamino-2,7-difluorofluorescein (DAF-FM), we have optimized a simple method for the determination of the generation of endothelial nitric oxide in a microplate format. Methods: A nitric oxide donor was used (3-morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride, SIN-1). Different factors affecting the method were studied, such as the effects of dye concentration, different buffers, time of reaction, gain, and number of flashes. Results: Beer's law was linear over a nanomolar range (1-10 nM) of SIN-1 with wavelengths of maximum excitation and emission at 495 and 525 nm; the limit of detection reached 0.897 nM. Under the optimized conditions, the generation of rat aortic endothelial NO was measured by incubating DAF-FM with serial concentrations (10-1000 mu M) of acetylcholine (ACh) for 3 min. To confirm specificity, N-omega-Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME)the standard inhibitor of endothelial NO synthasewas found to inhibit the ACh-stimulated generation of NO. In addition, vessels pre-exposed for 1 h to 400 mu M of the endothelial damaging agent methyl glyoxal showed inhibited NO generation when compared to the control stimulated by ACh. Conclusions: The capability of the method to measure micro-volume samples makes it convenient for the simultaneous handling of a very large number of samples. Additionally, it allows samples to be run simultaneously with their replicates to ensure identical experimental conditions, thus minimizing the effect of biological variability.

AB  - To understand better the adaptation strategies of intra-annual radial growth in Pious halepensis and Pious sylvestris to local environmental conditions, we examined the seasonal rhythm of cambial activity and cell differentiation at tissue and cellular levels. Two contrasting sites differing in temperature and amount of precipitation were selected for each species, one typical for their growth and the other represented border climatic conditions, where the two species coexisted. Mature P. halepensis trees from Mediterranean (Spain) and sub-Mediterranean (Slovenia) sites, and P sylvestris from sub-Mediterranean (Slovenia) and temperate (Slovenia) sites were selected. Repeated sampling was performed throughout the year and samples were prepared for examination with light and transmission electron microscopes. We hypothesized that cambial rhythm in trees growing at the sub-Mediterranean site where the two species co-exist will be similar as at typical sites for their growth. Cambium in P halepensis at the Mediterranean site was active throughout the year and was never truly dormant, whereas at the sub-Mediterranean site it appeared to be dormant during the winter months. In contrast, cambium in P. sylvestris was clearly dormant at both sub-Mediterranean and temperate sites, although the dormant period seemed to be significantly longer at the temperate site. Thus, the hypothesis was only partly confirmed. Different cambial and cell differentiation rhythms of the two species at the site where both species co-exist and typical sites for their growth indicate their high but different adaptation strategies in terms of adjustment of radial growth to environmental heterogeneity, crucial for long-term tree performance and survival.

AB  - Plantago fengdouensis is an endangered plant native to islands along the Yangtze River in the Three Gorges Reservoir of China, and P. asiatica is a weed mainly distributed in temperate zone of Asia. Because of contrasting distribution, tissue- and species-specific responses to waterlogging stress of these two accessions were tested in term of changes of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, membrane lipid peroxidation, free proline, and antioxidant defense systems. Our results suggested that the roots of P. fengdouensis had better tolerance to waterlogging stress than that of P. asiatica, while the leave of P. fengdouensis were more sensitive to waterlogging stress than that of P. asiatica in term of contents of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide radical (O-2(-)), hydroxyl radical (OH), and malondialdehyde (MDA). The roots of two Plantago species could more efficiently accumulate reduced glutathione (GSH) than leaves under waterlogging conditions. The leaves and roots of P. fengdouensis were more positive responses to waterlogging stress those of P. asiatica in term of GSH. P. fengdouensis were more tolerant to waterlogging stress in term of free praline levels and activities of catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APx), and glutathione reductase (GR) than P. asiatica, especially in root systems. The root systems of P. fengdouensis had more tolerant to waterlogging stress than that of P. asiatica, which may be positively related to its natural inhabiting conditions. Our results may be used as indicators of reconstruction of the ex situ populations of the conserved P. fengdouensis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Agricultural production monitoring plays a key role in a variety of economic and environmental practices including crop yield forecasting, identifying risk of disease and application of chemicals. Remote sensing has the potential to provide accurate crop condition information across large areas and has the ability to deliver information products in a timely within-season manner. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) frequencies are unaffected by most atmospheric conditions, making use of this technology of interest to crop monitoring. In this study, RADARSAT-2 polarimetric SAR responses of 21 parameters are compared with dry biomass of canola, corn, soybean, and spring wheat crops over a 6-week period for a site in western Canada. Dry biomass was targeted as this variable is a strong predictor of crop productivity. During the period of biomass accumulation, significant correlations with dry biomass were observed for most SAR parameters, for corn, canola, and soybeans. These findings are of interest as they could be used to target fungicide applications (canola) and to determine silage yields and resistance to disease (corn). For spring wheat, linear cross polarization and circular cross polarization backscatter, volume scattering and pedestal height were able to detect when wheat entered the milking stage which could prove useful as an indicator for the timing of spring wheat harvest. This study demonstrates that polarimetric SAR responds to accumulation of dry biomass, but as well that several radar parameters can uniquely identify changes in crop structure and phenology.

AB  - Models of birdsong are useful in the study of developmental and evolutional mechanisms of vocal learning behaviour. Knowledge of these mechanisms is important for understanding the evolutionary adaptation strategies of organisms. The Bengalese finch sings a complex song believed to have evolved by domestication because the song of its wild ancestor, the white-backed munia, was very simple. There is evidence that the song complexity is used as an indicator of male quality during mate selection. Because songbirds learn their song as juveniles, development of the song system is affected by developmental stress. Therefore, song traits may reflect developmental conditions and that may be honest sexually selected signals. We compared the level of the stress hormone corticosterone between Bengalese finches and white-backed munias. Results showed that Bengalese finches had lower circulating corticosterone levels than white-backed munias. Relaxation from natural selection pressures and the addition of artificial selection due to domestication may have decreased the corticosterone levels and allowed for the evolution of the complex song in the Bengalese finch. Two subtypes of corticosterone receptors, the glucocorticoid receptor and mineralocorticoid receptor, showed expression in song nuclei of the Bengalese finch brain. Thus, these results suggest the possibility that song development is regulated by corticosterone via binding to the corticoid receptors. Song-nuclei-related expression of corticoid receptors might have had an increasing developmental condition-dependent influence on song traits. Thus, our results suggest that decreased stress hormone levels secondary to domestication might account for one reason why songs became complex in Bengalese finches.

AB  - There is an analysis of the physico-chemical properties and the chemical composition of precipitation in a forest geoecosystem in acid immision conditions. The data used in the analysis was collected between 2000 and 2010. In that period, a drop in the immision scale of S-SO2 in the atmospheric air had been observed, which consequently was one of the reasons for a drop in the precipitation acidity. The conclusion was that rainwater, after penetrating treetops and trunks, undergoes a significant transformation whose intensity depends on species composition of the forest stand. Statistically relevant differences were found in coniferous stands, in which a substantial drop in pH was noted, in addition to an increase in the load of components accumulated in the soil in relation to atmospheric precipitation. The calculated indicators of the eco-chemical state of waters (Ma%) have revealed that throughfall waters in coniferous stands and fir and beech stemflow contain significant amounts of aluminium, manganese, iron and hydrogen ions in the sum of cations. Also the indicator of acid-neutralizing capacity (ANCaq) shows that these waters are more enriched with sulfate, nitrate and chloride ions than bulk precipitation. The recorded variation eventuates from processes related to dry and humid deposition, as well as ion-exchange processes occurring within the stand. The obtained results point to an intensification of chemical denudation within the trunks, triggering disadvantageous changes in both biotic and abiotic part of the ecosystem. The effects of the increased inflow of souring agents to the soil through stemflow are significant acidification of the top mineral soil horizon and an increase in the hydrolytic acidity.

AB  - Freshwater inputs often play a more direct role in estuarine phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) accumulation than nitrogen (N) inputs, since discharge simultaneously controls both phytoplankton residence time and N loading. Understanding this link is critical, given potential changes in climate and human activities that may affect discharge and watershed N supply. Chlorophyll a (chla) relationships with hydrologic variability were examined in 3-year time series from two neighboring, shallow (< 5 m), microtidal estuaries (New and Neuse River estuaries, NC, USA) influenced by the same climatic conditions and events. Under conditions ranging from drought to floods, N concentration and salinity showed direct positive and negative responses, respectively, to discharge for both estuaries. The response of chla to discharge was more complex, but was elucidated through conversion of discharge to freshwater flushing time, an estimate of transport time scale. Non-linear fits of chla to flushing time revealed non-monotonic, unimodal relationships that reflected the changing balance between intrinsic growth and losses through time and along the axis of each estuary. Maximum biomass occurred at approximately 10-day flushing times for both systems. Residual analysis of the fitted data revealed positive relationships between chla and temperature, suggesting enhanced growth rates at higher temperatures. N loading and system-wide, volume-weighted chla were positively correlated, and biomass yields per N load were greater than other marine systems. When combined with information on loss processes, these results on the hydrologic control of phytoplankton biomass will help formulate mechanistic models necessary to predict ecosystem responses to future climate and anthropogenic changes.

AB  - While the influence of climate, vegetation, management and abiotic site factors on total carbon budgets and turn-over is intensively assessed, the influences of these ecosystem properties on the chemical complexity of soil organic matter (SOM) remains poorly understood. This study addresses the chemical composition of NaOH-extracted SOM from maritime temperate forest sites in Flanders (Belgium) by pyrolysis-CC/MS. The studied forests were chosen based on dominant tree species (Anus sylvestris, Fagus sylvatica, Quercus robur and Populus spp.), soil texture and soil-moisture conditions. Differences in extractable-SOM pyrolysis products were correlated to site variables including dominant tree species, management of the woody biomass, site history, soil properties, total carbon stocks and indicators for microbial activity. Despite of a typical high intercorrelation between these site variables, the influence of the dominant tree species is prominent. The extractable-SOM composition is strongly correlated to litter quality and available nutrients. In nutrient-poor forests with low litter quality, the decomposition of relatively recalcitrant compounds (i.e. short and mid-chain alkanes/alkenes and aromatic compounds) appears hampered, causing a relative accumulation of these compounds in the soil. However, if substrate quality is favorable, no accumulations of recalcitrant compounds were observed, not even under high soil-moisture conditions. Former heathland vegetation still had a profound influence on extractable-SOM chemistry of young pine forests after a minimum of 60 years. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The diatoms Odontella sinensis, Coscinodiscus wailesii and Thalassiosira punctigera are the most common examples of non-indigenous phytoplankton species in the European Seas. We investigated their seasonal and inter-annual distributions at two fixed stations in the northeast English Channel (1998-2005). The climate conditions along our 8-y time series and those during the first historical outbreaks in Europe were reconstructed. Odontella sinensis was preferentially found in late summer and early autumn, especially after 2003. A change in the climate in 1903 may have favoured the development of O. sinensis that until then had gone unnoticed due to the low sample coverage. Coscinodiscus wailesii was preferentially found in winter and early spring, with a maximum in April 2001 (720 cells L(-1)). This coincided with exceptionally high precipitation rates, river discharges and a cold winter (negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation). Thalassiosira punctigera was sporadically found between autumn and early spring, with a peak in mid-December 2005 after abnormal autumn weather. The blooms of C. wailesii and T. punctigera in 1977-79 coincided with the arrival of the 'Great Salinity Anomaly' into the English Channel, negative NAO phase and higher river discharges. In addition to an introduction from sub-arctic waters, these two diatom species may remain as residual populations under 'normal' hydroclimatic conditions, misidentified, overlooked in the past and favoured after atypical climate periods. The consideration for these diatoms being labelled as introduced or non-native species is questionable.

AB  - In a process termed quorum sensing, bacteria use diffusible chemical signals to coordinate cell density-dependent gene expression. In the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, quorum sensing controls hundreds of genes, many of which encode extracellular virulence factors. Quorum sensing is required for A aeruginosa virulence in animal models. Curiously, quorum sensing-deficient variants, most of which carry a mutation in the gene encoding the central quorum sensing regulator lasR, are frequently isolated from acute and chronic infections. The mechanism for their emergence is not known. Here we provide experimental evidence suggesting that these lasR mutants are social cheaters that cease production of quorum-controlled factors and take advantage of their production by the group. We detected an emerging subpopulation of lasR mutants after approximate to 100 generations of in vitro evolution of the A aeruginosa wild-type strain under culture conditions that require quorum sensing for growth. Under such conditions, quorum sensing appears to impose a metabolic burden on the proliferating bacterial cell, because quorum-controlled genes not normally induced until cessation of growth were highly expressed early in growth, and a defined IasR mutant showed a growth advantage when cocultured with the parent strain. The emergence of quorum-sensing-deficient variants in certain environments is therefore an indicator of high quorum sensing activity of the bacterial population as a whole. it does not necessarily indicate that quorum sensing is insignificant, as has previously been suggested. Thus, novel antivirulence strategies aimed at disrupting bacterial communication may be particularly effective in such clinical settings.

AB  - The species composition and relative abundance of aquatic macrophytes was evaluated in five Cape Cod, Massachusetts, freshwater kettle ponds, representing a range of trophic conditions from oligotrophic to eutrophic. At each pond, aquatic vegetation and environmental variables (slope, water depth, sediment bulk density, sediment grain size, sediment organic content and porewater inorganic nutrients) were measured along five transects extending perpendicular to the shoreline from the upland border into the pond. Based on a variety of multivariate methods, including Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA), an indirect gradient analysis technique, and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), a direct gradient approach, it was determined that the eutrophic Herring Pond was dominated by floating aquatic vegetation (Brasenia schreberi, Nymphoides cordata, Nymphaea odorata), and the algal stonewort, Nitella. Partial CCA suggested that high porewater PO4-P concentrations and fine-grained sediments strongly influenced the vegetation of this eutrophic pond. In contrast, vegetation of the oligotrophic Duck Pond was sparse, contained no floating aquatics, and was dominated by emergent plants. Low porewater nutrients, low sediment organic content, high water clarity and low pH (4.8) best defined the environmental characteristics of this oligotrophic pond. Gull Pond, with inorganic nitrogen-enriched sediments, also exhibited a flora quite different from the oligotrophic Duck Pond. The species composition and relative abundance of aquatic macrophytes provide good indicators of the trophic status of freshwater ponds and should be incorporated into long-term monitoring programs aimed at detecting responses to anthropogenically-derived nutrient loading.

AB  - During the last few years sponges have been proven to be suitable model organisms for biomonitoring programmes. Previously it was reported that the marine sponge Suberites domuncula reacts to cadmium, both under controlled laboratory conditions and in the field with an increased expression of the heat-shock protein 70 and with DNA damage. In this study it is shown that this sponge contains a cadmium-binding protein with a M-r of 24 000. Cloning studies detected a gene in S. domuncula, termed SDMTL, which encodes a putative polypeptide, MTL_SUBDO, that shares high sequence similarity with metallothioneins (MTs) from Metazoa. The open reading frame displays a polypeptide with a calculated size of M-r of 17 103. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the sponge molecule, termed MT-like (MTL) protein, is related to the metazoan MTs. Under laboratory conditions, no expression of the SDMTL can be detected. After 1 d, incubation of the sponges with cadmium (200 mu g l(-1)) already revealed a dramatic upregulation of the MTL gene in S. domuncula. Subsequent studies in the field, the area around Rovinj (Croatia), demonstrated a correlation between the environmental load with cadmium (accumulation of this metal in the animals) and the expression of the gene encoding the 'detoxifying' cadmium-binding protein, MTL, in the test animals. These data suggest that the discovered MTL gene from S. domuncula is a sensitive indicator for environmental, bioavailable cadmium.

KW  - CRETACEOUS-TERTIARY BOUNDARY
AB  - Analysis of Maastrichtian dinoflagellate assemblages from the upper Ripley and Providence Formations in two cores from southwestern Georgia show changes that can be related to fluctuations in relative sea-level and in depositional environments. Sediments in the USGS Ft. Gaines Core were deposited in transitional zone to nearshore and estuarine environments close to a major fluvial source, whereas co-eval sediments in the USGS Albany Core were deposited in middle to outer shelf environments, laterally displaced away from any fluvial source.
   Lower Maastrichtian assemblages in the Ft. Gaines Core contain common Senegalinium obscurum and Cerodinium pannuceum. These point to overall transgressive conditions in the lower Providence, whereas decreases in percent marine phytoplankton indicate individual progradational episodes. The upper Providence of the Ft. Gaines Core shows a marked decrease in dinoflagellate species abundance and percent and absolute abundances of marine phytoplankton, with a concurrent increase in relative abundance of Achomosphaera-Spiniferites cysts. These indicators point to a relative regression and shoreward movement of facies through the upper Maastrichtian.
   Lower Maastrichtian assemblages in the more seaward Albany Core are dominated by Chatangiella? robusta, Exochosphaeridium bifidum, and Cerodinium pannuceum, and have a very high percent marine phytoplankton signal. These are interpreted to represent transgressive conditions with no progradation of the shoreline. The upper Providence shows high species abundance, increasing dominance by Achomosphaera-Spiniferites cysts, individual abundance peaks of several different species, and a decrease in percent marine phytoplankton, indicating an overall relative sea-level regression through the upper Maastrichtian.
   Comparison with dinoflagellate assemblages from Maryland suggest that high abundances of Areoligera cysts at about the lower/upper Maastrichtian boundary may reflect the level of maximum transgression in the middle of the Maastrichtian. Three new species are described: Florentinia perforata, Yolkinigymnium expansum, and Palambages trilicius.

AB  - A benthic macroinvertebrate and sediment chemistry study of the St. Clair River from Lake Huron to Lake St. Clair was conducted in the spring of 1985. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the environmental quality of the nearshore areas and assess the effectiveness of industrial and municipal abatement programs that have been implemented since 1977.
   A total of 112 macroinvertebrate taxa was collected from the river. Classification analysis indicated that 7 macroinvertebrate communities were evident in the river. Discriminant analysis suggested that physical habitat characteristics explained the distribution of 4 benthic communities, while sediment contaminants explained the distribution of 3 benthic communities. These analyses showed that the environmental quality of a 12 km stretch of the river along the Canadian shoreline had been degraded, probably by industrial waste discharges and spills. Toxic conditions were evident along the waterfront of Dow Chemical Canada Inc., probably a result of the combined effects of chlorinated organics, oils and greases, and mercury (historical contaminant) in the sediments. In contrast, the invertebrate fauna throughout the remainder of the St. Clair River reflected meso-eutrophic conditions, typical of a large, unstressed river.
   A comparison of the environmental quality as reflected by the benthic invertebrate fauna in 1985 with that in 1977 suggests that the abatement programs implemented over the past decade have improved the environmental quality along the Canadian side of the river. The total length of river adversely affected by waste discharges from Canadian industries and municipalities decreased from 21 km in 1977 to 12 km in 1985.

AB  - As a combined result of land subsidence and sea level rise in the vicinity of the City of Venice there has been a net decrease in the difference between the mean elevations of land and sea of about 30 centimetres over the past century.  This has resulted in an increased incidence of flooding in Venice with occasional disastrous consequences, as in November 1966 when storm and tide conditions combined to flood the Piazza San Marco to depths exceeding one metre.  Among the solutions proposed to solve the flooding problem is a modular tidal barrier that is designed to close the three major entrances to the shallow lagoon in which Venice is situated.  Because the lagoon is highly eutrophic and circulation is driven primarily by the tide in the Adriatic Sea, there is concern that operation of the barriers could exacerbate an already serious problem of pollution.  The lagoon currently receives the untreated waste water from Venice with an organic loading equivalent to more than 400,000 persons during the tourist season, industrial discharges from the Port of Marghera, and non-point accretions of nutrients from adjacent agricultural areas.  Preliminary investigation of the effects of the proposed barrier scheme using mathematical hydrodynamic and water quality models suggests that prolonged isolation of the lagoon from the sea, if this should become necessary for flood protection, may enhance primary production and induce unfavorable water quality conditions.  This paper presents results of this investigation and offers suggestions for further refinement and application of the models to assist in the environmental impact assessment which must be performed prior to barrier construction.

AB  - Oil shales contain organic matter from many sources, deposited under a variety of environmental conditions, which influence the potential for their commercial exploitation. Variations in organic matter type within the oil shales of the Lowmead Basin have been identified with reference to an integrated physico-chemical classification. The pyrolytic yield of the oil shales has been shown to correlate better with this classification than with a purely chemical classification. While the pyrolytic yield, in litres per metric tonne (l/mt), is satisfactory as a commercial assessment of the oil shales, the addition of TOC data is an additional indicator of the potential quantity and quality of the shale oil.

AB  - Specifically designed benthic chambers have been used to test whether the exposure for 48 hrs to polluted Lake Orta sediments could affect survival and reproduction behaviour of Daphnia obtusa and Echinogammarus stammeri. In situ results have been coupled to lab testing with Microtox, seed germination and root elongation (lactuca sativa, Cucumis sativus, Lepidium sativum), and invertebrates (Daphnia obtusa, D. magna, E. stammeri) acute toxicity tests.
   The technique and results here reported indicate the utility of in situ testing and suggest that under certain conditions this kind of test may be more realistic (avoiding sample manipulation in the lab) than traditional laboratory toxicity tests.

These resting stages (referred to as stomatocysts, statospores, or simply cysts) are known to be excellent indicators of past and present environmental conditions. This study focuses on the stomatocysts found in sediment traps and sediment cores from high-Alpine Lake Silvaplana (southeastern Swiss Alps, 1792 m a.s.l.). We describe 21 stomatocyst types using scanning electron microscopy that are new to science or that were not identified with certainty following the guidelines of the International Statospore Working Group.

It is our view that an assessment of reference conditions can be useful in the ERA process, for both prospective and retrospective ERAs, given adequate resources and acknowledgement and understanding of the limitations and uncertainties associated with this information. Suggestions and considerations for incorporating reference area information into an ecological risk assessment are discussed.

AB  - The up to 450 m-thick Upper Jurassic Lemes Formation includes organic-rich deep-water (max. similar to 300 m) sedimentary rocks deposited in the Lemes Basin within the Adriatic Carbonate Platform (AdCP). The Lemes Formation was investigated regarding (1) bio- and chemostratigraphy, (2) depositional environment, and (3) source rock potential. A multi-proxy approach-microfacies, Rock-Eval pyrolysis, maceral analysis, biomarkers, and stable isotope ratios-was used. Based on the results, the Lemes Formation is subdivided from base to top into Lemes Units 1-3. Deposition of deep-water sediments was related to a late Oxfordian deepening event causing open-marine conditions and accumulation of radiolarian-rich wackestones (Unit 1). Unit 2, which is about 50 m thick and Lower early Kimmeridgian (E. bimammatum to S. platynota, ammonite zones) in age, was deposited in a restricted, strongly oxygen-depleted basin. It consists of radiolarian pack- and grainstones with high amounts of kerogen type II-S organic matter (avg. TOC 3.57 wt.%). Although the biomass is predominantly marine algal and bacterial in origin, minor terrestrial organic matter that was transported from nearby land areas is also present. The overlying Unit 3 records a shallowing of the basin and a return to oxygenated conditions. The evolution of the Lemes Basin is explained by buckling of the AdCP due to ophiolite obduction and compressional tectonics in the Inner Dinarides. Lemes Unit 2 contains prolific oil-prone source rocks. Though thermally immature at the study location, these rocks could generate about 1.3 t of hydrocarbon per m(2) surface area when mature.

AB  - The characteristics of residential environments that may affect health are posited to contribute to social and race/ethnic inequities in health through the differential allocation of health-promoting resources and health-harming conditions that stem from macro-level processes that systematically sort large groups of the American population into different neighborhoods. However, few studies have examined how exposure to these neighborhood conditions is inequitably experienced by individuals over adulthood. Longitudinal studies are well positioned to contribute to our understanding of the accumulation of neighborhood (dis)advantages and their impact on health throughout the life course but must first overcome the challenge of measuring differences in neighborhood context across time and between population groups. Using a longitudinal cohort of Black and white U.S. adults followed over a 25-year period with linked census tract data, we computed a Neighborhood Vulnerability Index (NVI) that combines multiple indicators of neighborhood risk into one composite score and tested the assumption of configural, metric, and scalar invariance both longitudinally and between race/gender groups. Using confirmatory factor analysis, we identified a two-dimensional model for neighborhood vulnerability and computed an index that demonstrated multiple levels of race, gender, and race-by-gender invariance (chi(2) 1000.48, df 15, RMSEA 0.07, SRMR 0.02, CFI 0.98, TLI 0.97, AIC 751,272). Inequities in exposure to neighborhood vulnerability between Black and white men and women at the neighborhood level has important implications for understanding the root of social, health, and economic disparities that have persisted in the U.S. over the past several decades.

AB  - Porous asphalt mixture can be used as a road surface paving material with the remarkable advantage to prevent water accumulation and ponding. However, the performance of porous asphalt mixture in low temperature environment has not been thoroughly investigated, and this forms the subject of research in the present study. The mineral aggregate gradation of porous asphalt mixture was designed based on Bailey method, and the low temperature performance of porous asphalt mixture was studied by means of the low temperature bending test. The factors affecting the low temperature performance of porous asphalt mixture were analyzed through the orthogonal experimental design method, and the effects of porosity, modifier content, aging condition, and test temperature on the low temperature performance of porous asphalt mixture were evaluated. The results showed that the modifier content was the most important factor affecting the low temperature performance of porous asphalt mixture, followed by the test temperature, while the porosity and the aging condition were the least. Among the three performance evaluation indicators, namely the flexural tensile strength, maximum bending strain, and bending stiffness modulus, the maximum bending strain had the highest sensitivity to the porosity. It can be seen from the single factor influence test of porosity that there existed an approximately linear relationship between the maximum bending strain and the porosity of porous asphalt mixture, and the maximum bending strain decreased with increasing porosity. Furthermore, in order to ensure the good working performance of porous asphalt mixture in low temperature environment, the porosity should also satisfy the required limits of the maximum bending strain.

AB  - This study presents how human-altered hydrographical settings (flow restrictions) impacts the natural distribution and community structure of copepods in the Kochi Backwaters (KBW), the largest monsoonal estuary along the southwest coast of India. This study is primarily based on an extensive seasonal sampling in the KBW and their comparison with a historical data set. Thannermukkom Barrage (TB) was built in the southern section of the KBW in the 1970s to prevent saline water intrusion to the upstream during the non-monsoon periods. Thirteen locations (1-4 in the downstream, 5-9 in the midstream, and 10-13 in the upstream) were sampled in this study over the entire stretch of the KBW during the Pre-Southwest Monsoon (PRM), Southwest Monsoon (SWM), and Post-Southwest Monsoon (PSWM). The overall effect of TB in the KBW is a seaward push of mesohaline conditions during all seasons with varying intensities. In response to the seaward push of mesohaline conditions, copepods Acartiella keralensis, Acartia plumosa, Acartia sp., Pseudodiaptomus annandalei, Pseudodiaptomus serricaudatus, Euterpina acutifrons and Oithona brevicornis showed a corresponding spatial shift for their highest abundance and diversity from midstream during PRM to the downstream during the SWM/PSWM. Multivariate and IndVal analysis demarcated many indicator species of copepods of different hydrographical settings in the KBW. A comparison with the historical data set showed that there is an apparent long-term change in hydrography, copepod composition and community structure in the upstream of the KBW due to TB.

AB  - Regional climate change impacts show a wide range of variations under different levels of global warming. Watersheds in the northeastern region of the United States (NEUS) are projected to undergo the most severe impacts from climate change in the forms of extreme precipitation events, floods and drought, sea level rise, etc. As such, there is high possibility that hydrologic regimes in the NEUS may be altered in the future, which can be absolutely devastating for managing water resources and ecological balance across different watersheds. In this study, we present a comprehensive impact analysis using different hydrologic indicators across selected watersheds in the NEUS under different thresholds of global temperature increases (1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 degrees C). Precipitation and temperature projections from fourteen downscaled Global Circulation Models (GCMs) under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 greenhouse gas concentration pathway are used as inputs into a distributed hydrological model to obtain future streamflow conditions. Overall, the results indicate that the majority of the selected watersheds will enter a wetter regime, particularly during the months of winter, while flow conditions during late summer and fall indicate a dry future under all three thresholds of temperature increase. The estimation of time of emergence of new hydrological regimes show large uncertainties under 1.5 and 2.0 degrees C global temperature increases; however, most of the GCM projections show a strong consensus that new hydrological regimes may appear in the NEUS watersheds under 3.0 degrees C temperature increase.

AB  - Gaining knowledge about the condition of quality of life (QoL) in different geographical regions has always been one of the concerns of the decision-makers. Dynamic and multi-dimensional characteristics of QoL ask for new data sources to update the relevant indicators and novel methods for QoL assessment. This research presents a comprehensive framework for assessing QoL in intra-national level. To address current challenges, the focus has been on integrating subjective and objective criteria, using the geotagged Tweets as user-generated geo-contents (UGGCs) to extract some subjective criteria, and utilizing a multi-criteria decision-making framework based on the cumulative belief degree (CBD) method to integrate and provide the final output. The proposed framework is implemented to assess the QoL in the provinces of Iran as the case study. Based on the obtained results, Tehran has a better QoL status, while Sistan-and-Balouchestan and Kermanshah have rather unsuitable conditions compared to other provinces. Results show the potential of the UGGCs to cover the dynamic characteristics of QoL and to complement the official data. Also, the functional capabilities of the CBD method in integrating heterogeneous criteria, handling uncertainty, and suitably providing the final results of QoL assessment in different scenarios allow authorities to get a more comprehensive, realistic view on QoL issues. The proposed method of this research is a step toward an integrated assessment of QoL using the data shared by people in the location-based social networks which could be regarded as a novel and useful tool for administrators in the field of QoL.

AB  - Fungi can cause serious damages to historical works of art. This study aims to evaluate fungal pollution in the indoor air environment, deposited dust and surfaces of works of art in a historic house museum "Prince's Mohamed Ali museum", Giza, Egypt. Fungal pollution was evaluated at six museum's buildings differed in size, design, location and content, for 2 years of campaign. The deposited dust was collected once every 3 months, while surface swabs were collected twice, after 1 year and 2 years of exposure. Airborne fungal concentrations were evaluated using volumetric (Andersen 2 stage impactor) and gravimetric (index microbial air contamination) air samplers. Airborne fungal concentrations ranged within 47-784 CFU/m(3) and 175-40,250 CFU/m(2)/h using volumetric and gravimetric samplers, respectively. Indoor/outdoor ratio confirmed that outdoor environment was the main source of indoor fungal pollution. The rate of deposited dust was similar to 90-folds lower indoor than outdoor. Fungal concentrations associated deposited dust ranged between 10(2) and 10(4) CFU/g, representing a cause of concern. In respect to medium type, fungal diversity profile was in order of deposited dust >= airborne >= surfaces. Alternaria, Aspergillus and Cladosporium were the common fungal taxa. Secondary and tertiary fungal colonizers were detected after 2 years of exposure, indicating the presence of adequate moisture content inside the museum. No clear relationship patterns were found between microclimatic conditions and fungal culturability. The measured indoor fungal pollution and microclimatic conditions represented a problem for works of art and early indicator for fungal accumulation and biodegradation.

AB  - Populations at the edge of their species' distribution ranges are typically living at the physiological extreme of the environmental conditions they can tolerate. As a species' response to global change is likely to be largely determined by its physiological performance, subsequent changes in environmental conditions can profoundly influence populations at range edges, resulting in range extensions or retractions. To understand the differential physiological performance among populations at their distribution range edge and center, we measured levels of mRNA for heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) as an indicator of temperature sensitivity in two high-shore littorinid snails, Echinolittorina malaccana and E. radiata, between 1 degrees N to 36 degrees N along the NW Pacific coast. These Echinolittorina snails are extremely heat-tolerant and frequently experience environmental temperatures in excess of 55 degrees C when emersed. It was assumed that animals exhibiting high temperature sensitivity will synthesize higher levels of mRNA, which will thus lead to higher energetic costs for thermal defense. Populations showed significant geographic variation in temperature sensitivity along their range. Snails at the northern range edge of E. malaccana and southern range edge of E. radiata exhibited higher levels of hsp70 expression than individuals collected from populations at the center of their respective ranges. The high levels of hsp70 mRNA in populations at the edge of a species' distribution range may serve as an adaptive response to locally stressful thermal environments, suggesting populations at the edge of their distribution range are potentially more sensitive to future global warming.

AB  - The performance of Cd, Ni, and Cu release from river sediment at different pH was investigated by a leaching test using deionised water and river water as leachants. Visual MINTEQ geochemical software was used to model the experimental results to predict heavy metal release from sediments. The distribution and speciation of heavy metals in the sediments after leaching test were analyzed by Tessier sequential extraction. Leaching test results showed that the release amounts of Cd, Ni, and Cu are in the range of 10.2-27.3 mg.kg(-1), 80.5-140.1 mg.kg(-1), and 6.1-30.8 mg.kg(-1), respectively, with deionised water as leachant at different pH. As far as the river water was used as the leaching solution in the test, the results show similar metal leaching contents and tendencies to that of the deionised water as leaching solution. The results of Tessier sequential extraction indicate that Cd of residual fraction easily forms obvious precipitate under the acidic condition, especially in the range of pH 0-4 with the residual of Cd over 50% of the total Cd in the sediment. The exchangeable content of Ni decreases with the increase of pH under the range of 0-5. The Fe-Mn oxide fraction of Cu in the sediments changes significantly from pH 0 to pH 9. Based on the effect of pH on the leaching of Cd, Ni, and Cu from the polluted sediment in the tests, more accurate information could be obtained to assess the risk related to metal release from sediments once it is exposed to the changed acid/alkali water conditions.

AB  - The Nitrates Directive requires considering all possible sources of nitrogen available for crops before decision is made for the use of commercial fertilisers. Soil is one of the nitrogen supplying sources but to quantify the amounts which could be released in a plant available form and take part in yield formation is difficult. Chemical and biological methods developed for laboratory and field conditions do not always give good response or are unpractical for farm conditions. Therefore an indirect soil nitrogen supply assessment method is proposed which could use the data available for each field on every farm. The first step includes estimation of soil total organic nitrogen pool derived from indices of soil organic matter content and soil pH. The second step is the use of soil nitrogen apparent recovery factors, developed from field experiment data. Such factors were developed for winter rye and wheat, spring wheat and barley, winter and spring rape as well as potatoes and are based on 72 field experiments performed in Latvia on mineral soils within a five-year (2008-2012) period. In average, the following soil nitrogen recovery factors were obtained: for winter cereals - 3.3-3.4%, winter rape - 2.3%, spring cereals and rape - 1.8-2.6% and potatoes - 3.8%, calculated from the soil total organic nitrogen pool within 0-20 cm depth. There was strong correlation (r = 0.980, P <= 0.01) between apparent recovery values if they were calculated only based on 0-20 cm soil layer or based on 0-40 cm. Therefore it is possible to make calculations only for topsoil data which are commonly available from routine soil tests.

AB  - We designed this community-based participatory research (CBPR) project aiming to generate evidence-based research results to encourage residents living in urban low-income public housing dwellings engaging in a community-wide integrated pest management (IPM) program with the intention to improve their health and quality of life, as well as household conditions. We enrolled 20 families and their children in this study in which we utilized environmental exposure assessment (surface wipe and indoor air) tools to quantitatively assessing residential pesticide exposure in young children before the implementation of an IPM program. We analyzed those samples for 19 organophosphate (OP) and pyrethroid pesticides.
   The most commonly detected pesticides were pyrethroids, particularly permethrin and cypermethrin with average concentrations of 2.47 and 3.87 mu g/m(2), respectively. In many dwellings, we detected OPs, which are no longer available on the market; however, their levels are significantly lower than those of pyrethroids. None of the 20 families was free from pesticide contamination in their households, and pesticides were commonly detected in living room and children's bedroom.
   The correlation among household hygienic conditions, the sighting of live pests/pest debris, and the degree of indoor pesticide contamination highlights the failure of conventional chemical-based applications for pest controls. The results from the current study, as well as other recent studies, conducted in low-income public housing, child care centers, and randomly selected homes in the U.S. should accentuate the need for alternative pest management programs that incorporate safer and more sustainable protocols for pest controls.

AB  - Piriformospora indica is a root-interacting mutualistic fungus capable of enhancing plant growth, increasing plant resistance to a wide variety of pathogens, and improving plant stress tolerance under extreme environmental conditions. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which P. indica can improve plant tolerance to stresses will pave the way to identifying the major mechanisms underlying plant adaptability to environmental stresses. We conducted greenhouse experiments at three different salt levels (0, 100 and 300 mM NaCl) on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivar "Pallas" inoculated with P. indica. Based on the analysis of variance, P. indica had a significant impact on the barley growth and shoot biomass under normal and salt stress conditions. P. indica modulated ion accumulation in colonized plants by increasing the foliar potassium (K+)/sodium (Na+) ratio, as it is considered a reliable indicator of salt stress tolerance. P. indica induced calcium (Ca2+) accumulation and likely influenced the stress signal transduction. Subsequently, proteomic analysis of the barley leaf sheath using two-dimensional electrophoresis resulted in detection of 968 protein spots. Of these detected spots, the abundance of 72 protein spots changed significantly in response to salt treatment and P. indica-root colonization. Mass spectrometry analysis of responsive proteins led to the identification of 51 proteins. These proteins belonged to different functional categories including photosynthesis, cell antioxidant defense, protein translation and degradation, energy production, signal transduction and cell wall arrangement. Our results showed that P. indica induced a systemic response to salt stress by altering the physiological and proteome responses of the plant host.

AB  - The simultaneous effects of temperature and salinity on the accumulation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and oysters (Ostrea edulis) were studied under experimental conditions with different concentrations of E. coli in seawater. The experiments were carried out in 3000 L tanks, within the natural range of temperature (12 degrees C, 18 degrees C and 24 degrees C) and salinity (32 psu and 37 psu) in the coastal areas of the Adriatic Sea. Within the achieved range of E. coli concentrations in seawater (4x10-4.6x10(3) CFU/100 ml), bacteria accumulated rapidly in the bivalves, reaching the highest concentrations (plateau) after 1 h in mussels and 2 h in oysters. Under the same concentrations of E. coli in seawater, a significantly higher plateau was reached in mussels than oysters. Significant correlations between the E. coli concentration in seawater and bivalves (CR; concentration ratio) were found. The results clearly showed that CR was controlled by temperature and salinity of seawater. Changes in temperature had a strong effect on CR fluctuation, whereas in oysters an effect of changes in salinity on CR variation was also found only in oysters. The interaction between temperature and salinity was statistically significant and suggested that their simultaneous effects on CR were significantly greater than when each of these factors acted independently. The highest E. coli concentrations in mussels and oysters exceeded the concentrations in seawater by an order of magnitude at least, while the CR in mussels exceeded the CR in oysters by 7.7- to 38.5-fold.

AB  - Autonomous sensors are required for a comprehensive documentation of the changes in the marine carbon system and thus to differentiate between its natural variability and anthropogenic impacts. Spectrophotometric determination of pH - a key variable of the seawater carbon system - is particularly suited to achieve precise and drift-free measurements. However, available spectrophotometric instruments are not suitable for integration into automated measurement systems (e.g. FerryBox) since they do not meet the major requirements of reliability, stability, robustness and moderate cost. Here we report on the development and testing of a new indicator-based pH sensor that meets all of these requirements. This sensor can withstand the rough conditions during long-term deployments on ships of opportunity and is applicable to the open ocean as well as to coastal waters with a complex matrix and highly variable conditions. The sensor uses a high resolution CCD spectrometer as detector connected via optical fibers to a custom-made cuvette designed to reduce the impact of air bubbles. The sample temperature can be precisely adjusted (25 degrees C +/- 0.006 degrees C) using computer-controlled power supplies and Peltier elements thus avoiding the widely used water bath. The overall setup achieves a measurement frequency of 1 min(-1) with a precision of +/-0.0007 pH units, an average offset of +0.0005 pH units to a reference system, and an offset of +0.0081 pH units to a certified standard buffer. Application of this sensor allows monitoring of seawater pH in autonomous underway systems, providing a key variable for characterization and understanding of the marine carbon system.

AB  - Although the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, has been a very important model system for the study of intrafamilial conflict and parental strategies, a detailed understanding of the variation in parental effort that can occur both within and between pairs is lacking. In part this is because many different methods have been used by individual studies to quantify parental care (i.e. nest visit rate, time in the nest and number of feeds per visit), but these have not directly been compared. We used nestbox cameras to monitor parental visit rate and the distribution of food among the nestlings in domestic, captive wild and wild free-living zebra finches. The percentage of nest visits by parents in which they fed the nestlings was consistent, with multiple feeds to different nestlings occurring within a single visit. The quantity of food delivered and its distribution among the nestlings, however, varied greatly both within and between broods. The number of regurgitations a brood received correlated significantly with the number of individual feeds when accounting for environment, but not with nest visit rate or the duration of time parents spent in the nestbox. In captive conditions, parents visited the nest at twice the rate of wild free-living birds, overall providing nestlings with twice the amount of food. Captive conditions also led to food distribution becoming less equitable among the brood, owing to changes in the number of regurgitations per individual feed and the number of overall feeds per nest visit.

AB  - A high-resolution nested WAM/SWAN wave model suite aimed at rapidly establishing nearshore wave forecasts as well as a climatology and return values of the local wave conditions with Rapid Environmental Assessment (REA) in mind is described. The system is targeted at regions where local wave growth and partial exposure to complex open-ocean wave conditions makes diagnostic wave modelling difficult.
   SWAN is set up on 500 m resolution and is nested in a 10 km version of WAM. A model integration of more than I year is carried out to map the spatial distribution of the wave field. The model correlates well with wave buoy observations (0.96) but overestimates the wave height somewhat (18%, bias 0.29 m).
   To estimate wave height return values a much longer time series is required and running SWAN for such a period is unrealistic in a REA setting. Instead we establish a direction-dependent transfer function between an already existing coarse open-ocean hindcast dataset and the high-resolution nested SWAN model. Return values are estimated using ensemble estimates of two different extreme-value distributions based on the full 52 years of statistically downscaled hindcast data. We find good agreement between the downscaled wave height and wave buoy observations. The cost of generating the statistically downscaled hindcast time series is negligible and can be redone for arbitrary locations within the SWAN domain, although the sectors must be carefully chosen for each new location.
   The method is found to be well suited to rapidly provide detailed wave forecasts as well as hindcasts and return values estimates of partly sheltered coastal regions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Emerging and future climatic change across the Australian continent has been identified as a significant threat to the successful sustainable management of the nation's water resources. However, the impacts of climate change must be viewed within the context of past, present and future climatic variability and human agency. A qualitative screening-level risk assessment was undertaken for Australia's 325 surface water management areas by aggregating a suite of six relevant risk indicators. Four indicators addressed the antecedent conditions upon which future climate change will act. These included 50-year trends in rainfall, the status of surface and groundwater development, and catchment condition. Two indicators addressed future drivers of supply and demand; specifically, projected changes in runoff and population. The results indicate that the management challenges currently experienced in Australia's population centres and key agricultural areas such as the Murray-Darling Basin are likely to increase in future decades. Furthermore, the geographic distribution of net risk, inclusive of multiple biophysical and socioeconomic drivers, is more extensive than is suggested by consideration of surface water development and availability alone. Comparison of at-risk catchments with the spatial distribution of various social and environmental assets identified a high degree of overlap among catchment risk and human populations, water storages, irrigated agricultural land, and wetlands of international significance. This suggests that the catchments of the greatest value are also those judged to be at greatest risk. Though considerable work remains in evaluating the security of Australia's water resources to climatic and other stressors, this study provides a first-order scheme for prioritising the risks to which catchments are exposed and an assessment of how some key drivers are likely to interact to drive risk.

AB  - [ 1] A stochastic flood generator and calibrated sediment transport formulae were used to assess the decadal impact of major river rehabilitation strategies on two fraction bed material sediment flux and net storage, first-order indicators of aquatic riverine habitat, in a large river system. Model boundary conditions were modified to reflect the implementation of three major river rehabilitation strategies being considered in the Sacramento River Valley: gravel augmentation, setting back of levees, and flow alteration. Fifty 30-year model simulations were used to compute probabilities of the response in sediment flux and net storage to these strategies. Total annual average bed material sediment flux estimates were made at six gauged river cross sections, and similar to 60 km reach-scale sediment budgets were evaluated between them. Gravel augmentation to improve spawning habitat induced gravel accumulation locally and/or downstream, depending on the added mixture. Levee setbacks to recreate the river corridor reduced flow stages for most flows and hence lowered sediment flux. Flow alteration to mimic natural flow regimes systematically decreased total annual average flux, suggesting that high-magnitude low-frequency transport events do not affect long-term trends in bed material flux. The results indicate that each rehabilitation strategy reduces sediment transport in its target reaches and modulates imbalances in total annual bed material sediment budgets at the reach scale. Additional risk analysis is necessary to identify extreme conditions associated with variable hydrology that could affect rehabilitation over decades. Sensitivity analysis suggests that sorting of bed material sediment is the most important determinant of modeled transport and storage patterns.

AB  - Sub-fossils of Cladocera and Foraminifera were used to reconstruct changes since 1870 in the trophic dynamics of two brackish lakes, Glombak and Han Vejle, located in the Vejlerne nature reserve, Denmark, a site of international conservation importance. After creation of the lakes in the mid-1870s following land reclamation, the two lakes have developed quite differently; today Glombak is turbid, while Han Vejle is clear. In both lakes, stratigraphic changes in the assemblages of foraminifers and cladocerans indicate an abrupt shift from marine to brackish conditions at the end of the 19th century, coinciding with land reclamation. However, the composition of the fossil invertebrate assemblages in the 20th century implies differences in the exposure to salinity, in fish predation and in habitat diversity. In Glombak, the cladoceran record suggests relatively saline conditions in the first quarter of the last century and high macrophyte abundance followed by lower salinities and subsequently a major decrease in macrophyte abundance and an increase in fish predation during the past ca. 40 years. By contrast, in HanVejle low salinity, high abundance of macrophytes and only minor changes in fish predation seem to have prevailed throughout most of the 20th century. The results are consistent with recent contemporary data, the few historical records, as well as with trends in the records of diatoms and macrofossils. This study highlights the potential of using crustacean remains as indicators of long-term changes in the trophic dynamics of brackish lakes.

AB  - Drainage ditches and ground-water gradients in abandoned agricultural sapric peatlands (mucklands) produce distinctive vegetation patterns. Ditches in abandoned mucklands were ineffective in creating ground-water depression in adjacent soil, while ditches in a newly-cleared muckland were effective in doing so. Upon abandonment, drainage ditches are subject to bank erosion and sedimentation. Coupled with years of soil subsidence and an altered hydrologic regime, ditches lose effectiveness in draining and function merely as small-scale topographic depressions, providing linear zones of seasonally high water levels. Species are distributed on abandoned mucklands in association with soil moisture conditions induced by topographic variation at both small (i.e., ditches) and larger (i.e., site-wide) spatial scales. Vegetation that is usually restricted to moist or saturated soils had greater cover closer to or within drainage ditches or in other topographically low areas, while species with low fidelity to saturated soil dominated the remaining drier areas. Some shrub species had slightly greater stem densities either within or immediately adjacent to ditches, resulting in a ''parallel'' distribution (i.e., illustrating ditch-fidelity). Species having higher affinity to lower soil moisture conditions, such as quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), showed significantly greater stem density in areas farther away from ditches. Ground-water levels are of primary importance in affecting distribution patterns on naturally revegetating, abandoned agricultural mucklands. The accuracy of the wetland indicator status for woody and herbaceous species encountered on these abandoned mucklands is supported quantitatively by direct gradient analysis. The functioning of existing drainage ditch systems should be assessed prior to any mitigation or restoration activities.

AB  - Technology should combine into a single production process biotechnical methods of stimulating the development of functional capabilities and increasing the adaptive abilities of animals with zootechnical techniques that provide comfortable conditions and preservation of the existing stereotype of housing throughout the entire technological cycle, which makes it possible to exclude unjustified losses in productivity and contributes to more complete manifestation of genetic potential. Therefore, search is required for such technological solutions that would not interfere with the animal body, but, on the contrary, would have a stimulating nature. At all stages of the productive life of animals, searches are needed to develop new and improve existing technologies that would best meet the physiological needs of the body. The paper presents the results of researches aimed to establish the optimal feeding front for lactating cows during the period of milk production and mid-lactation. It has been determined that comfortable ethological signs, expressed in the indices of food, motor and general activity, were manifested during the period of milk production in cows with a feeding front of 0.60-0.65 m/animal. These animals showed higher indicators of milk yield. For cows in the mid-lactation, the optimal feeding front was 0.45-0.50 m/animals. It allows to create more comfortable conditions for cows during the main lactation period, which contributes to more complete implementation of the genetic potential of dairy performance. The research results can be used in design and construction of industrial dairy complexes.

AB  - The White Sea is a small semi-enclosed Arctic sea influenced by Atlantic waters. It was completely covered by the Scandinavian Ice Sheet in the Late Pleistocene and plays a key role in the reconstruction of the degradation of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet and Atlantic Water advection into the Arctic Ocean. We examined the inflow of Atlantic water into the White Sea Basin as the leading feature of postglacial sedimentation processes. Palaeoreconstructions were conducted through detailed studies of diatom assemblages in two sediment cores from the central area (PS-6042) and outer part (PS-6050) of Dvina Bay. Stratigraphic division of the core sediments was performed on the basis of palynostratigraphy and accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 dates. The composition of diatom assemblages in postglacial sediments from Dvina Bay indicate a change in the environment from a freshwater sea bay to fully marine conditions over the past 12 cal kyr. Based on the obtained results, we established that the Atlantic water started to flow into the central Dvina Bay in the first half of the Preboreal (11.7-11.3 cal ka BP), and the greatest increase in water surface temperatures in central Dvina Bay occurred during the period from the end of the Atlantic to the first half of the Subboreal. We confirmed these conclusions through comparison with previously obtained results of aquatic palynomorphs, pollen and spores, grain size analysis, and measurements of total organic carbon and biogenic silica contents, as well as through correlation with published palaeoreconstructions of the White Sea and the Arctic Ocean.

AB  - Artemisia adamsii is a weed with low palatability to livestock and is thus recognized as an indicator of rangeland degradation in Mongolia. We investigated the germination characteristics of this species, phytotoxic suppression of its germination by its own residue, and the applicability of such germination behaviour to the control of this species. We also discussed the ecological consequence of these factors regarding the vegetation dynamics of the Mongolian steppe. Germination of A. adamsii was tested at different light and temperature conditions. Germination was also tested for A. adamsii and four native grassland species in the presence or absence of A. adamsii residue. Germination of A. adamsii was light-demanding and temperature-dependent. Artemisia adamsii residue showed autotoxic but sub-fatal suppression of germination, and the chemicals causing that suppression were shown to be aqueous and volatile. Phytotoxicity of A. adamsii residue on the germination of grassland species was low, except for in Artemisia frigida. The applicability of the observed sub-fatal autotoxicity for controlling this species was likely to be low, but the elucidated germination characteristics could contribute to developing a strategy for controlling this species. The autotoxicity in A. adamsii germination was suggested to have an ecological consequence that mediates species transition from A. adamsii to other species in degraded land occupied by A. adamsii. As low-palatability A. adamsii can act as a nurse plant of palatable species under grazing conditions, the invasion of A. adamsii into disturbed grasslands may facilitate the recovery of such grasslands in terms of improving pasture quality.

AB  - Fossil phytolith assemblages in lake sediments are widely used to reconstruct past vegetation patterns and dynamics, especially in subtropical environments. However, our understanding of how hydrodynamic conditions (river input and lake basin sedimentological processes) influence the transportation and taphonomy of phytoliths in lacustrine sediments is limited. The aim of this study is to use phytolith assemblage and grain size analyses of Qingshitan Lake surface sediments to identify the distribution characteristics and main transportation modes of phytoliths in lakes. Our results show that the grain size of surface sediments changes across different lacustrine areas of Qingshitan Lake. The median diameter (Md) and volume moment mean diameter (D(4,3)) of surface sediments gradually decreases with distance from the inlet river mouth. The phytolith assemblages of surface sediments vary between sampling locations in the lake. The percentage of woody dicotyledon phytoliths decreases from the estuary delta to the central lake basin, and correlates with the Md and D(4,3) of lake sediments. We find that phytolith assemblages in the riverine delta are mainly influenced by hydrodynamic (river input) processes and record the vegetation cover of the Gongping River catchment. Assemblages in the central lake basin are affected not only by riverine influences but also by eolian transport and similarly reflect the local vegetation. Investigating the relationships between the phytolith assemblages and sediment grain sizes in lakes may make it possible to identify the phytolith source area, which is crucial information to interpret assemblages and indices.

AB  - Lichens play an essential role in northern ecosystems as important contributors to the water, nutrient and carbon cycles, as well as the main winter food resource for reindeer (Rangifer tarandus, also called caribou in North America), the most abundant herbivores in arctic and subarctic regions. Today, climate change and several types of land use are rapidly transforming northern ecosystems and challenging lichen growth. Since lichens are important indicators of ecosystem health and habitat suitability for reindeer, large-scale assessments are needed to estimate their past, present and future status. In our study, we aimed to develop models and equations that can be used by stakeholders to identify the occurrence of lichen-dominated boreal forests and to determine lichen conditions in those forests. Data were collected in Sweden and most input data are publicly available. We focused on mat-forming lichens belonging to the genera Cladonia and Cetraria, which are dominant species in the reindeer and caribou winter diet. Our models described lichen-dominated forests as being dominated by Scots pine (Pines sylvestris), having low basal area and thin canopy cover, and being located in south-and west-facing areas with high summer precipitation, low winter precipitation and temperature, and on gentle slopes. Within those forests, lichen biomass was positively related to tree canopy cover and summer precipitation, while negatively and exponentially related to intensity of use of the area by reindeer. Forest, meteorological, topographic and soil data can be used as input in our models to determine lichen conditions without having to estimate lichen biomass through demanding and expensive fieldwork.

AB  - To identify characteristics of aeolian activity and the aeolian environment in China's eastern desert region, this study collected surface sediment samples from the main desert and sandy lands in this region: the Hobq Desert and the Mu Us, Otindag, Horqin, and Hulunbuir sandy lands. We analyzed the grain-size characteristics and their relationships to three key environmental indicators: drift potential, the dune mobility index, and vegetation cover. The main sediment components are fine to medium sands, with poor (Hulunbuir) to moderate (all other areas) sorting, of unimodal to bimodal distribution. This suggests that improved sorting is accomplished by the loss of both relatively coarser and finer grains. Since 2000, China's eastern desert region has generally experienced low wind energy environmental conditions, resulting in decreased dune activity. In the Hobq Desert, however, the dry climate and sparse vegetation, in conjunction with the most widely distributed mobile dune area in the eastern desert region, have led to frequent and intense aeolian activity, including wind erosion, sand transport, and deposition, resulting in conditions for good sediment sorting. In the Mu Us, Otindag, and Horqin sandy lands, mosaic distribution has resulted from wind erosion-dominated and deposition-dominated aeolian environments. In the Hulunbuir Sandy Land, high precipitation, low temperatures, and steppe vegetation have resulted in well-developed soils; however, strong winds and flat terrain have created an aeolian environment dominated by wind erosion.

AB  - Coagulation studies were carried out simultaneously in a batch and continuous mode systems. Four coagulants of varied properties were used. Both test procedures contained the same process phases (rapid mixing. flocculation, sedimentation) and a corresponding coagulant dosage range (1.7-3.3 gAl/m(3)). In the batch mode test, the raw water composition was stable, while in the continuous mode test it was subject to changes resulting from natural variation in source water properties. The main process effectiveness measures were: color, absorbance at 254 nm, and dissolved organic carbon content. Studies in the batch mode system showed clear linear relationships between coagulant dosage and effectiveness of analyzed water contamination indicators values reduction. Tests in flow conditions confirmed the relationships found in the batch test, albeit with lesser agreement with a linear effectiveness - coagulant dosage model. Due to a comparison of coagulation results from both test systems, it was possible to determine the relationships between coagulation effectiveness obtained in continuous and batch mode systems. The linear relationships obtained show a dependence on current raw water properties and the type of coagulant used. However. in many cases, these relationships do not differ significantly as with respect to analyzed water quality indicators. The general rule is that the effectiveness observed in the continuous mode system is larger than that for the batch mode process. which is justified due to different process conditions. Determining the relationship between coagulation results obtained for different experimental procedures allows for predicting effects of changes in technical systems based on laboratory results.

AB  - The cultivation of grapevines for winemaking, known as viticulture, is widely cited as a climate-sensitive agricultural system that has been used as an indicator of both historic and contemporary climate change. Numerous studies have questioned the viability of major viticulture regions under future climate projections. We review the methods used to study the impacts of climate change on viticulture in the light of what is known about the effects of climate and weather on the yields and quality of vineyard harvests. Many potential impacts of climate change on viticulture, particularly those associated with a change in climate variability or seasonal weather patterns, are rarely captured. Key biophysical characteristics of viticulture are often unaccounted for, including the variability of grapevine phenology and the exploitation of microclimatic niches that permit successful cultivation under suboptimal macroclimatic conditions. We consider how these same biophysical characteristics permit a variety of strategies by which viticulture can adapt to changing climatic conditions. The ability to realize these strategies, however, is affected by uneven exposure to risks across the winemaking sector, and the evolving capacity for decision-making within and across organizational boundaries. The role grape provenance plays in shaping perceptions of wine value and quality illustrates how conflicts of interest influence decisions about adaptive strategies within the industry. We conclude by considering what lessons can be taken from viticulture for studies of climate change impacts and the capacity for adaptation in other agricultural and natural systems.

AB  - ObjectivesThe south coast of New Guinea has a complex prehistory known for its exchange systems that linked distinct cultural groups living along the coast, inland, and on offshore islands. Here we compare the palaeohealth of two relatively contemporaneous skeletal samples from the south coast of New Guinea (850-200 BP) that were from two ecologically different sites (one inland and one offshore island) and likely represent distinct cultural groups. We aim to elucidate health patterns that may provide information about the specific lifeways and quality of life of each community.
   Materials and MethodsOral conditions (caries, calculus, alveolar lesions, and antemortem tooth loss [AMTL]) were analyzed macroscopically to assess possible intra- and inter-population variation in oral and physiological health. The frequency of linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) was also used as a nonspecific indicator of stress to assess childhood health at each site.
   ResultsThe inhabitants from the small offshore island of Motupore, thought to be associated with Austronesian-speaking Motu tribes, displayed different patterns of oral pathological conditions (more carious lesions on the tooth crown and calculus) and LEH (lower frequencies) compared with inland people residing at the site of Nebira.
   DiscussionIt is suggested that the causes for the variation in oral and physiological health were likely multifactorial and potentially associated with variables such as the ecological and geographical settings of the sites, cultural differences, infectious disease, differential fertility and, potentially, diet. This research provides previously unknown information about possible culturally-moderated practices that affected health in the past. Am J Phys Anthropol 160:414-426, 2016.

AB  - Remote sensing observations and rover missions have documented the presence of sulphate-rich mineral associations on Mars. Many of these minerals are paleo-indicators of hydrous, acidic and oxidising environments that must have prevailed in Mars' distant past, contrary to the present conditions. Furthermore, occurrences of silica together with high Cl and Br concentrations in Martian soils and rocks represent fingerprints of chemically atypical fluids involved in processes operating on the surface or at shallow depth. From field observations at representative active volcanoes in subduction settings, supported by geochemical modelling, we demonstrate that volcanic hydrothermal systems are capable of producing Mars-like secondary mineral assemblages near lakes, springs and fumaroles through the action of acidic fluids. Water-gas-rock interactions, together with localised flow paths of water and fumarolic gas emitted from associated subaerial vents, lead to deposition of a range of sulphates, including gypsum, jarosite, alunite, epsomite and silica. Evaporation, vapour separation and fluid mixing in (near-) surface environments with strong gradients in temperature and fluid chemistry further promote the diversity of secondary minerals. The mineralogical and chemical marks are highly variable in space and time, being subject to fluctuations in ambient conditions as well as to changes in the status of volcanic-hydrothermal activity. It is concluded that active processes in modern volcanic-geothermal systems may be akin to those that created several of the sulphate-rich terrains in the early history of Mars.

AB  - The performance of a multistage treatment system for textile wastewater was investigated in this study. The processes of electrocoagulation (EC), photo-Fenton oxidation, and activated sludge biological degradation were integrated in batch mode. The integrated treatment system performance was assessed according to three response variables: dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biodegradability index. Based on preliminary tests, the EC-based wastewater treatment was suitable as the first stage of the integrated treatment system, followed by the photo-Fenton process. A lab photo-reactor was used to assess the influence of photo-Fenton variables on the process performance. Based on the better lab photo-Fenton reactor conditions, the improvement of some biological indicators related to the organics biodegradability of treated wastewater was investigated in a pilot-scale photoreactor. An activated sludge-based biological reactor at lab-scale was used as a final treatment stage, in order to achieve the legislated limits for discharge into water bodies. Partial degradation of the organic pollutants was achieved by the EC process, with a 36% reduction in COD. In the second treatment stage, a 70% biodegradability index was attained by setting the photo-Fenton reaction conditions at 100 mg Fe2+ L-1, pH 2.8, 12 mM H2O2 and 6.9 kJ L-1 accumulated energy. Finally, a residual COD of 139 mg O-2 L-1 was achieved at the outlet of the biological process, which is below the maximum limit established by the Portuguese legislation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted for two years on sandy loam soil for maize (Zea mays L.) cultivation on beds. An index called least limiting water range (LLWR) was computed to compare hydrophysical characteristics of soil under bed planted maize with those under conventionally flat planted maize. Among all four parameters of LLWR, soil water content at field capacity (fc) and wilting point (q(pwp)) did not change much, whereas soil water content at 10% aeration porosity (q(ap)) reduced significantly and soil water content at 2MPa soil strength (q(2MPa)) increased appreciably with increase in bulk density (BD). It was further observed that available water retention capacity (AWRC) did not vary appreciably with BD, whereas LLWR decreased with increase in BD, which indicated that LLWR was a true indicator of soil structural condition. Again, lower water stress period was obtained under bed as compared to conventional planting system. Field saturated hydraulic conductivity at 10 cm soil depth was 3 times of its value of 0.36 cm/hr under conventional planting. Root length density was also more in upper 45 cm in beds due to porous soil environment. These results thus indicated that bed-planting system is superior to conventional planting as it had wider LLWR indicating better water availability and improved soil structural conditions which led to enhanced root growth, and higher maize yield. The above study also confirmed that LLWR could be used as a tool for assessing the suitability of a given soil management practices in improving soil productivity.

AB  - Alum treatment is a lake restoration technique that is used to address internal phosphorus (P) loading. We evaluated the macroinvertebrate density and P release rates from sediment cores in Spring Lake, Michigan, 5 yr aft er an alum treatment and compared the findings with conditions before and 1 yr aft er application. Total macroinvertebrate density recovered to the near pre-alum level aft er the decline that was measured in 2006. Community structure also shifted, with the dominant group changing from oligochaetes before alum treatment to chaoborids in 2010. Chironomid density in 2010 was similar to pre-alum density, but this represented a decline from an elevated density measured in 2006. Ceratopogonid density increased in 2010 compared with the prior samplings, but absolute densities were very low compared with other macroinvertebrate groups. Maximum P release rates from sediment cores in 2010 averaged from 1.68 to 2.81 mg P m(-2) d(-1) under anoxic conditions. These rates are an order of magnitude lower than before alum was applied, indicating the alum application was still effectively reducing P release rates from sediments in Spring Lake. However, the release rates have increased since 2006, suggesting that alum efficacy may be declining. The NaOH-extractable soluble reactive P fraction has increased since 2006, suggesting that the aluminum hydroxide floc is successfully binding P in the sediments. Despite the low release rates of P from the sediment, water column P and chlorophyll concentrations remain elevated in Spring Lake. This points to the continued need for reductions in external P loads to Spring Lake.

AB  - The endangered European relict species complex Lathyrus pannonicus shows distinct morphological variation, reflected by the number of subspecies recognized, and complicated patterns of genetic variation. The traditionally recognized subspecies appear to possess different ecological preferences and disjunct distributions, particularly in the western range of the species. In this study, L. pannonicus was investigated by the correlation of distance matrices based on phytosociological, ecological, molecular and morphological data. Ecological characteristics of selected stands of L. pannonicus throughout Europe were assessed using 'Ellenberg values' of all the constituent taxa in phytosociological releves. Genetic distances were calculated using recently developed methods to analyse high degrees of intra-individual nuclear-encoded internal transcribed spacer variability. We found that the remarkable genetic (and morphological) diversity in L. pannonicus could not be explained solely by the fragmentation of the distributional range. Instead, patterns of morphological and genetic differentiation were a reflection of the moisture regime in the sampled stands. Two major lineages could be identified: (1) a lineage adapted to dry conditions (Ellenberg indicator F-value < 3.5) and (2) a lineage preferring moist conditions (F-value >= 4.5). Although both lineages occurred in close proximity in the Pannonian area, they appeared to be reproductively isolated in general. Further data are needed to determine whether these genetically and ecologically defined lineages, or ecospecies, within the L. pannonicus species complex can be formalized as (Linnaean) species or subspecies.

AB  - [1] Self-potential (SP) data are collected over an area of approximately 250 m 2 at the Department of Energy Savannah River Site where there is known subsurface dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) contamination. Nonpolarizing electrodes are used to measure the SP signal on a two-dimensional (2-D) surface grid with 2-m spacing in both horizontal directions, and four borehole arrays with 3.7-m electrode spacing and 25.6-m total depth. The primary contaminants, tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE), are known to undergo redox reactions in the environment. Variations in the subsurface redox conditions are proposed as an electrochemical source for the SP signals measured in this investigation. A 3-D self-potential inversion algorithm is used to find an electrical current source model, taking into account the resistivity structure derived from a 3-D spectral induced polarization survey at the same field location. The sources and sinks of electrical current can be related to the zones of relative high or low redox potential and are therefore interpreted in the context of contaminated areas. These results are reasonably correlated with DNAPL concentration data obtained from several ground-truth well measurements, indicating that the SP sources can be an indicator of contaminated areas where electrochemical source mechanisms are active. In several cases, however, the SP sources and contaminant concentrations are not correlated, reflecting the spatial variability of biogeochemical parameters in the Earth that control the SP response in addition to concentration. More extensive geochemical ground-truth information is therefore needed to validate the self-potential source inversion methodology and develop it as a predictive tool in the context of contaminated sites.

AB  - Assay protocols for RNA and DNA in crude plankton extracts using the fluorochrome SYBR Green 11 are developed here. The method is based on the fluorescence in 3 aliquots: the first measures RNA after DNA digestion; the second measures DNA after RNA digestion; and the third measures residual fluorescence after digestion of both DNA and RNA. This residual fluorescence measurement is critical for accurate calculations of the nucleic acids. Optimisation of the assay conditions are described: fluorochrome concentration, buffer composition, fluorescence stability, temperature and duration of nuclease incubation. In the optimised procedure, the assays are performed in 5 mM Tris buffer (containing 0.9 mM CaCl2-2H(2)O and 0.9 mM MgCl2-6H(2)O, pH 8.0); DNase and RNase incubations are conducted at 37 degrees C for 20 min; the fluorochrome is added to all assays at a final concentration of 3.5x10(-4) and readings are done within the 10-60 min period following the SYBR Green It addition. The study evidenced the importance of the residual fluorescence after nuclease digestion, which is especially taken into account in the calculation of the nucleic acid concentrations. Finally, the variability of the fluorescent response to different RNA and DNA standards is examined; from the performed tests, calculations are based on rRNA from calf liver and DNA from calf thymus standards. The accompanying paper (Berdalet et al., 2005) describes the development of the extraction protocol, as well as the application of both protocols in measuring RNA/DNA ratios in natural plankton samples, and a comparison with ethidium bromide based methods.

AB  - Mineral magnetic properties (SIRM, ARM, HIRM and S-ratios) are presented for two AMS C-14-dated pit-sequences of lake sediments recovered from Haoluku and Liuzhouwan (similar to 43 degreesN, 117 degreesE). The two sites fall in the semi-humid to semi-arid climate transition zone, Dali Nor area of the southeast Inner Mongolia Plateau, China. Complemented by data for loss-on-ignition (LOI), total organic carbon (TOC), carbon/nitrogen (C/N), grain-size, and pollen, these mineral-magnetic measurements provide additional insights into environmental changes occurring at this area over the last 13 500 years. Conditions were extremely dry and windy as shown by the low SIRM, ARM and HIRM and high S-ratios before 13 500 yr BP. The environment began to ameliorate gradually since then, and a further humidification occurred at similar to 10300 yr BP in Haoluku, the northern site, and at similar to 9400 yr sp in Liuzhouwan, the southern one, as implied by the increased but only moderately high SIRM, ARM and HIRM and decreased S-ratios. As indicated by the remarkably increased SIRM, ARM, HIRM and S-ratios, a deterioration commenced at similar to 5600 yr sp in Haoluku and at similar to 4700 yr BP in Liuzhouwan. In Haoluku, conditions have been generally dry and windy since similar to 5600 yr BP despite a minor amelioration at 4500-3000 yr BP. A short but marked amelioration occurred at 1200-700 yr up in Liuzhouwan. S-ratios seem to be a reliable indicator of environmental aridity for this area. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - A modelling approach is described to assess potential productivity of soils with gypsum in Quinto (northeastern Spain) for irrigated alfalfa, taking into account the environmental conditions, described during a detailed soil survey, and different management levels. The soils assessed in this article are: Xeric Torrifluvents, Xeric Torripsamments, Typic Haplogypsids, and Typic Haplocalcids. The methodology considers only two hierarchically ordered production situations. The simplest or highest situation is an alfalfa cropping system in which the production potential depends on radiation and temperature regime during the crop cycle. As these factors cannot normally be manipulated, the yield of alfalfa is only determined by its physiological characteristics, the prevailing level of irradiance and the temperature regime. Calculation of this climatic production potential (CPP) is based on the crop growth model of FAO AEZ-project. Water availability is considered optimal under irrigation, therefore yield potential in the second hierarchical production situation is determined by reducing the CPP for unfavourable soil conditions, including gypsum content, and by considering different management levels. The effect of unfavourable soil characteristics on the final land production potential (LPP), is expressed by a soil index, calculated using a parametric approach. The correlation between predicted yields and actual reported yields suggests a close resemblance between the simulated production environment and the situation in which alfalfa grows. The proposed model is useful in assessing comparative land productivity and allows an evaluation of the impact of the considered soil characteristics on the final crop production. Quantification of the major constraints allows estimation of the required inputs to increase productivity. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Oxygen and carbon isotopic measurements were obtained from microsamples of an adult Laternula elliptica, an infaunal, aragonitic, Antarctic bivalve. The deltaO-18 values of samples from the exterior surface are, on average (approximately 4.5 parts per thousand), similar to calculated values inferred to represent precipitation in equilibrium with ambient environmental conditions. This indicates that bulk samples as well as many microsamples from the exterior surface would provide reliable isotopic estimates of paleotemperatures and paleosalinities. Nevertheless, both oxygen and carbon isotopic values from discrete shell areas may be influenced by vital effects. There is a statistically significant difference in deltaO-18 values of samples along the shell margin (deposited approximately synchronously) from the posterior and ventral region of the shell, and in deltaC-13 values of samples from the anterior, posterior and ventral regions. In addition, deltaC-13 and deltaO-18 values of shell margin samples are positively and linearly related to sample distance measured from the shell umbo. This relation is opposite to that observed in studies where aragonite inorganically precipitated at a slow rate has higher deltaC-13 values than that precipitated at high rates.
   Comparison of isotopic compositions of aragonitic L. elliptica with the calcitic bivalve Adamussium colbecki collected at the same location and time demonstrates an O-18 enrichment of biogenic aragonite relative to calcite at temperatures below O-degrees-C. Isotopic values from the adult portion of the shell of A. colbecki were found to be reliable indicators of typical environmental conditions. These results demonstrate the potential usefulness of isotopic evidence from fossil L. elliptica and A. colbecki in reconstructing ancient Antarctic seawater temperature/salinity and environments.

AB  - Landscape ecologists may be faced with ranking the relative environmental quality of watersheds across a region. The rankings would be based on measured or modeled variables with inherent sources of error. This paper examines the impact of data uncertainty on the ranking assigned to watersheds. The approach is Monte Carlo simulation in which the individual variables are considered to be estimated with uncertainty. The results show that watersheds in the best and the worst condition have rankings that are robust to uncertainty but intermediate watersheds may be difficult or impossible to assign to a rank.

AB  - Quercus robur, Q. frainetto, Q. cerris and Q. petraea that predominate in forests in the Thrace region, a bridge between the Balkans and Anatolia, were sampled, elaborated and classified. The ecological conditions were estimated by bio-indicator values. Oak forests can be divided into four groups: Q. robur-Fraxinus angustifolia forests thriving in floodplains, Q. petraea forests found at higher altitudes, Q. frainetto-Carpinus orientalis forests appearing in the warmest and driest sites and Q. frainetto forests on more humid sites. It was established that the most important topographic factor is altitude, while slope and aspect are of minor importance.

AB  - Aims Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) are ubiquitous soil microorganisms playing a vital role in the functioning of agricultural ecosystems. Although AMF are generally considered to have a low host specificity, it has been suggested that modern plant breeding has selected crop genotypes that are more selectively associated with AMF, possibly resulting in modern high yielding varieties (HYV) having a lower AMF diversity than traditional crop varieties. Whether this is true for paddy rice varieties under field conditions is not known so far. Here, we aimed at comparing differences of AMF communities among modern HYV and traditional rice varieties. Methods We collected root and soil samples of five Bangladeshi rice varieties (two traditional and three modern HYV) from 40 different rice fields and quantified AMF richness, diversity and community composition through high throughput amplicon sequencing of the small subunit (SSU) of the ribosomal RNA cistron. Results Overall, 75 AMF OTUs, distributed over six AMF families with Glomeraceae as predominant family were found. After accounting for differences in soil conditions, we found that AMF diversity significantly differed among the five varieties and was higher in the traditional than modern varieties. The composition and structure of the AMF communities were distinct between the traditional and modern varieties. An indicator species analysis detected 9 OTUs significantly associated with traditional rice varieties, whereas no indicator OTUs were found for the modern HYV. Conclusions We conclude that modern breeding coupled with high fertilizer application rates provide a plausible explanation for the reduced AMF diversity and the different AMF community composition between Bangladeshi modern HYV and traditional varieties.

AB  - Life history theory predicts trade-offs in allocation between survival, maintenance, growth, and reproduction, especially when resources are scarce. Individual variation in resource acquisition can affect trade-offs, but is often unaccounted for. We quantified the fitness costs of reproduction, accounting for environmental conditions, maternal characteristics and individual variation. We analyzed 10 years of data from marked kangaroos to evaluate how reproductive allocation affected annual mass change and skeletal growth, subsequent fecundity and weaning success, and survival, accounting for maternal mass or size and forage availability. Through repeated measurements of 76-91 females, we investigated how trade-offs varied within and between individuals, assessing whether individual variation could mask population-level trade-offs. In poor environments, females that weaned an offspring lost mass. Females that nursed an offspring for > 7 months had reduced skeletal growth. Females that did not gain mass over the previous 12 months rarely reproduced, especially if they had nursed an offspring for > 7 months the previous year. Reproductive allocation had no effect on weaning success, which was very low, and did not affect maternal survival, suggesting a conservative strategy. Disentangling within- and between-individual responses revealed trade-offs within individuals, but because individuals did not vary in their responses to earlier effort, these trade-offs did not drive population trends. The interacting effects of environmental conditions, maternal characteristics and individual variation on allocation trade-offs demonstrate the importance of long-term monitoring for understanding life history variations in changing environments.

AB  - In this article identifies new sources of obtaining biological substances from plants of the genus Atraphaxis (A. spinosa) prepared in the Almaty region.
   According to well - known methods, the analysis of indicators and standards of raw material quality-humidity, total ash, sulphate ash, insoluble ash in 10% hydrochloric acid-was developed and carried out.
   Micro- and macroelements determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Analysis of the elemental composition shows that iron predominates from microelements, and sodium, potassium and calcium from macronutrients.
   Conditions for obtaining a biologically active complex from the aboveground part of Atraphaxis spinosa developed for the first time. The optimal conditions for obtaining the complex are extractant - 50% ethanol, the ratio of extractant and raw materials - 1:8, double extraction time - 48 hours, temperature - 22 - 26 degrees C.
   The lipophilic composition identified by chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Since lipophilic fractions of plant samples include such classes of compounds as fatty acids; mono-; di-; triglycerides, phospholipids, sterols, Sterol esters, glycolipids, fat-soluble vitamins, they can considered not only as nutritional products, but also as possible pharmacological agents. The content of lipophilic components - 26 organic compounds-was determined. It found that A. spinosa contains a large amount of di - (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (54.66%) and beta-sitosterol (13.11%).
   A complex study of plant resources as medicinal raw materials provides for the chemical study of biologically active substances and biological screening of extracts and individual compounds obtained from plants. In most cases, the extract showed a wide range of antibacterial activity against the used strains of microorganisms.

AB  - Spatiotemporal variability in flow determines the physical structures of habitat. During low flows, aquatic organisms can be exposed to reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations, increased water temperature, and desiccation, whereas at high flows, increased velocity and hydraulic forces on the streambed can be equally detrimental. These constraints create a mosaic of habitat that influences the distribution and abundance of aquatic biota. This mosaic can change due to stochastic events or those mediated by humans. Understanding how low and high flow conditions affect aquatic organisms is critical not only for advancing ecological knowledge but also for protecting imperiled aquatic species such as unionid mussels. The overall goal of this project was to examine how substrate and hydrologic conditions affect mussel habitat and to then use the resulting information combined with life-history traits and shell morphology (i.e., sculpturing) to better understand how flow shapes mussel assemblage structure. Using quantile regression, we found that low values of relative shear stress (RSS), a measure of substrate stability, were associated with high mussel species richness and density. Change point analysis using threshold indicator taxa analysis (TITAN) indicated species-specific preferences for varying levels of bed stability. These preferences were best explained by life-history strategy and shell morphology based on the results of a principal component analysis. Using these results, we then present a conceptual model from which to derive expectations concerning taxonomic composition, life-history strategy, and shell sculpture type based on the degree of substrate mobility using RSS and variability in RSS.

AB  - Marine carbonate delta C-13 and delta O-18 values are commonly utilized as indicators of past climate and are thought to record primary seawater conditions. However, these minerals can be altered following deposition and burial, overprinting the primary signal to reflect subsurface conditions. Whereas the influence of post-depositional alteration is widely understood in carbonate-dominated sediments (Swart, 2015), the influence has not been as widely studied in mud-rich settings. This study analyzed the carbonate delta C-13 and delta O-18 values from carbonate intervals in the Late Pennsylvanian Wolfcamp D shale unit in the Midland Basin to evaluate the impact of post-depositional alteration on the interpretation of stable isotope compositions of carbonates in a mud-rich depositional environment. Here we show the importance of using multiple indicators to fully evaluate the impact of post-depositional alteration on the interpretation of the marine carbonate delta C-13 and delta O-18 values in mud-rich environments. The extent of diagenesis in the Wolfcamp D was primarily controlled by fluctuations in benthic redox chemistry, which controlled sulfate reduction and the preservation of organic matter. These processes influenced the extent of carbonate cementation in the bacterial sulfate reduction zone and during deep-burial, making the carbonates unreliable for intra-basinal correlations. The results of this study were incorporated into a conceptual model that can likely be applied as a framework for other studies in mud-rich depositional environments.

AB  - Incubators are essential for a range of culture-based microbial methods, such as membrane filtration followed by cultivation for assessing drinking water quality. However, commercially available incubators are often costly, difficult to transport, not flexible in terms of volume, and/or poorly adapted to local field conditions where access to electricity is unreliable. The purpose of this study was to develop an adaptable, low-cost and transportable incubator that can be constructed using readily available components. The electronic core of the incubator was first developed. These components were then tested under a range of ambient temperature conditions (3.5 degrees C - 39 degrees C) using three types of incubator shells (polystyrene foam box, hard cooler box, and cardboard box covered with a survival blanket). The electronic core showed comparable performance to a standard laboratory incubator in terms of the time required to reach the set temperature, inner temperature stability and spatial dispersion, power consumption, and microbial growth. The incubator set-ups were also effective at moderate and low ambient temperatures (between 3.5 degrees C and 27 degrees C), and at high temperatures (39 degrees C) when the incubator set temperature was higher. This incubator prototype is low-cost (< 300 USD) and adaptable to a variety of materials and volumes. Its demountable structure makes it easy to transport. It can be used in both established laboratories with grid power or in remote settings powered by solar energy or a car battery. It is particularly useful as an equipment option for field laboratories in areas with limited access to resources for water quality monitoring.

AB  - The determination of a proper minimum environmental flow in a river basin is one of the most critical components of sustainable water resources management, with hydraulic and habitat modelling being the most advance methods for that analysis. The present study illustrates the ecohydraulic modelling of Nestos River Delta at the deltaic zone of a heavily modified watershed under various low flow scenarios, using the RIVER2D Model. RIVER2D is a two-dimensional, depth averaged hydrodynamic and fish habitat model, widely used in environmental flow assessment studies. A detailed digital model of the river channel and its surrounding area was developed, including all the morphological characteristics of the river channel, as well as its various sandy islets. Field surveys in combination with Digital Elevation Model data were used for the development of the digital terrain used as input to RIVER2D model. Several different steady state hydraulic simulations were conducted under typical low flow conditions, producing water depth and water velocity (direction and magnitude) maps for each discharge scenario, while results were verified with the use of field measurements. In the next step, RIVER2D was used for the fish habitat modelling of the study area, with the application of fish preference curves developed specifically for the study area. Finally, the fish habitat modelling was conducted for four different fish species, divided into two age groups, forced under the same five typical low flow conditions. Results reveal that the ecohydraulic modelling of river basins should be considered as an indispensable component in sustainable water resources management.

AB  - Bats play an important role in agroecology and are effective bioindicators of environmental conditions, but little is known about their fundamental migration ecology, much less how these systems are responding to global change. Some of the world's largest bat populations occur during the summer in the south-central United States, when millions of pregnant females migrate from lower latitudes to give birth in communal maternity colonies. Despite a relatively large volume of research into these colonies, many fundamental questions regarding their abundance-including their intra- and interseasonal variability-remain unanswered, and even estimating the size of individual populations has been a long-running challenge. Overall, monitoring these bat populations at high temporal resolution (e.g., nightly) and across long time spans (e.g., decades) has been impossible. Here, we show 22 continuous years of nightly population counts at Bracken Cave, a large bat colony in south-central Texas, enabling the first climate-scale phenological analysis. Using quantitative radar monitoring, we found that spring migration and the summer reproductive cycle have advanced by approximately 2weeks over the study period. Furthermore, we quantify the ongoing growth of a newly-established overwintering population that indicates a system-wide response to changing environmental conditions. Our observations reveal behavioral plasticity in bats' ability to adapt to changing resource availability, and provide the first long-term quantification of their response to a changing climate. As aerial insectivores, these changes in bat phenology and propensity for overwintering indicate probable shifts in prey availability, with clear implications for pest management across wider regional agrisystems.

AB  - Gibbs sampling is routinely used to sample truncated Gaussian distributions. These distributions naturally occur when associating latent Gaussian fields to category fields obtained by discrete siniulation Methods like multipoint, sequential indicator simulation and object-based simulation. The latent Gaussians are often used in data assimilation and history matching algorithms. When the Gibbs sampling is applied on a large lattice, the computing cost can become prohibitive. The usual practice of using local neighborhoods is unsatisfying as it can diverge and it does not reproduce exactly the desired covariance. A better approach is to use Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRF) which enables to compute the conditional distributions at any point without having to compute and invert the full covariance matrix. As the GMRF is locally defined, it allows simultaneous updating of all points that do not share neighbors (coding sets). We propose a new simultaneous Gibbs updating strategy on coding sets that can be efficiently computed by convolution and applied with an acceptance/rejection method in the truncated case. We study empirically the speed of convergence, the effect of choice of boundary conditions, of the correlation range and of GMRF smoothness. We show that the convergence is slower in the Gaussian case on the torus than for the finite case studied in the literature. However, in the truncated Gaussian case, we show that short scale correlation is quickly restored and the conditioning categories at each lattice point imprint the long scale correlation. Hence our approach enables to realistically apply Gibbs sampling on large 2D or 3D lattice with the desired GMRF covariance.

AB  - Resistance strategies of clonal organs, and parent and offspring shoots of Phragmites australis (common reed) to heavy metal pollution in soils are not well known. To clarify the tolerance or resistance strategies in reeds, we conducted a pot experiment with five levels of Pb concentration (0 similar to 4,500 mg kg (-1)) in flood and drought conditions. Lead toxicity had no inhibitory effect on the number of offspring shoots in flood environment; however, biomass accumulation, and photosynthetic and clonal growth parameters were inhibited in both water environment. At each treatment of Pb concentration, offspring shoots had greater biomass and higher photosynthesis indicators than parent shoots. The lowest Pb allocation was found in rhizomes. More ofthe Pb transported to above-ground parts tended to accumulate in parent shoots rather than in offspring shoots. Biomass and photosynthesis of offspring shoots, rhizome length, and the number ofbuds, rhizomes and offspring shoots in the flooded treatment were significantly greater than those in the drought treatment. Our results indicated that the tolerance strategies used by reeds, including higher biomass accumulation and photosynthesis in offspring shoots, low allocation of Pb in rhizomes and offspring shoots, and stable clonal growth, maintained the stability of population propagation and productivity, improving the resistance of reeds to Pb pollution in flood environment. However, the resistance or tolerance was significantly reduced by the synergistic effect of Pb and drought, which significantly inhibited biomass accumulation, photosynthesis, and clonal growth of reeds.

AB  - Mortality by vehicular traffic is a well-documented, worldwide threat to chelonian populations. We present a detailed analysis of the conditions and measures for prevention of turtle mortality included in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) decisions for important road constructions issued between 2008 and 2016 by the competent authority (the Ministry of the Environment and Waters, MoEW) of Bulgaria. We identified seventeen EIAs issued for priority objects of the national road network that have been finalized or are currently under construction. All EIA decisions contained specific instructions for protecting the turtle populations, including avoiding damage to eggs, nests or adults during the construction phase, avoiding fragmentation of the populations, limiting access of animals to the road to prevent direct collisions with vehicles. We focused on the instructions included in every EIA decision concerning the design of the constructions preventing access of turtles to the road. Most EIA decisions issued between 2008 and 2010 provide very detailed prescriptions for the design of solid barriers made of wood plates, or long and solid concrete walls. During the execution of the measures by the contractors, some severe technical flaws of both designs were identified. Therefore, alternative projects for implementation of the mitigation measures have been proposed. The competent authority (MoEW) had followed the local legislation requirements and issued additional ordinations for the design changes. We comment on the technical characteristics of the barriers for turtles and discuss on the functionality of some proposed and some already build constructions.

AB  - In the tropics, some agricultural lands are abandoned for economic or technical reasons, leading to the recovery of woody vegetation. Our research aimed to identify the main drivers of spontaneous recovery of vegetation in a basin located in the Colombian Andes. This was done by combining spatially explicit environmental and socioeconomic variables at landscape (e.g. distances to human settlements, to roads, and to forests and mean annual precipitation) and local scales (e.g. depth of the organic layer, soil bulk density, and canopy openness). These variables were measured in 28 temporal plots of 500 m(2) each, established in land cover transitions that showed the recovery of woody vegetation. The recovered woody vegetation between 1986 and 2012 exhibited a gregarious spatial pattern at the landscape scale. Ordination analysis showed distinct floristic composition among transitions and remnant forests, and species associated to each one through an indicator species analysis. Multivariate analyses revealed the relationship between the transitions and variables at both scales. Woody vegetation recovery occurred near remnant forests and far from human settlements at the landscape scale. The soil conditions (content and depth of the organic horizon and bulk density) were the main drivers at the local scale. Our findings also highlight the necessity to define different restoration approaches such as incorporation of sites where socioeconomic and environmental conditions favor the spontaneous recovery of vegetation into the existing network of protected areas in the region, and to implement active restoration projects in perturbed sites to accelerate the recovery process of Andean forests.

AB  - Crowding of Atlantic salmon in a net-pen before slaughter was studied from start to finish. Environmental parameters (dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, current velocity and water depth), fish behaviour, ventilation rates, blood chemistry (cortisol, pH and lactate), initial pH in white muscle and related time to onset of rigor mortis were assessed to evaluate the condition of the fish during crowding. Even though the fish in the net-pen were severely stressed before the crowding operation started, crowding led to considerably higher cortisol levels and ventilation rates. However, prolonged crowding did not significantly increase the cortisol levels further. The initial pH of the muscle also showed that the fish were severely stressed before crowding, but in this case the fish were not further stressed to exhaustion by crowding. Using fish behaviour as single stress indicator for evaluation welfare-related issues must be done with caution since under the prevailing circumstances, diametrically opposed conclusions were drawn from monitoring fish behaviour versus evaluation of acute stress (blood chemistry and muscle biochemistry). The results were discussed in terms of animal welfare, stress, fish processing, and whether choice of technology actually could improve conditions for crowded fish in cases where they are slaughtered just after crowding.
   Statement of relevance: The present research is relevant for salmon processors who are using waiting cages before slaughter. The goal was to provide background information for improving fish handling operations and choosing technology. The data are also useful in connection with various steps in the production chain where crowding is an integral part of the unit operations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Extreme variability in abundance of California salmon populations is often ascribed to ocean conditions, yet relatively little is known about their marine life history. To investigate which ocean conditions influence their distribution and abundance, we surveyed juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) within the California Current (central California [37 degrees 30N) to Newport, Oregon (44 degrees 00N]) for a 2-week period over three summers (2010-2012). At each station, we measured chlorophyll-a as an indicator of primary productivity, acoustic-based metrics of zooplankton density as an indicator of potential prey availability and physical characteristics such as bottom depth, temperature and salinity. We also measured fork lengths and collected genetic samples from each salmon that was caught. Genetic stock identification revealed that the majority of juvenile salmon were from the Central Valley and the Klamath Basin (91-98%). We constructed generalized logistic-linear negative binomial hurdle models and chose the best model(s) using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) to determine which covariates influenced the salmon presence and, at locations where salmon were present, determined the variables that influenced their abundance. The probability of salmon presence was highest in shallower waters with a high chlorophyll-a concentration and close to an individual's natal river. Catch abundance was primarily influenced by year, mean fork length and proximity to natal rivers. At the scale of sampling stations, presence and abundance were not related to acoustic indices of zooplankton density. In the weeks to months after ocean entry, California's juvenile Chinook salmon population appears to be primarily constrained to coastal waters near natal river outlets.

AB  - Game theory provides a useful theoretical framework to examine the decision process operating in the context of environmental assessment, and to examine the rationality and legitimacy of decision-making subject to Environmental Assessment (EA). The research uses a case study of the Environmental Impact Assessment and Sustain ability Appraisal processes undertaken in England. To these are applied an analytical framework, based on the concept of decision windows to identify the decisions to be assessed. The conditions for legitimacy are defined, based on game theory, in relation to the timing of decision information, the behaviour type (competitive, reciprocal, equity) exhibited by the decision maker, and the level of public engagement; as, together, these control the type of rationality which can be brought to bear on the decision. Instrumental rationality is based on self-interest of individuals, whereas deliberative rationality seeks broader consensus and is more likely to underpin legitimate decisions. The results indicate that the Sustainability Appraisal process, conducted at plan level, is better than EIA, conducted at project level, but still fails to provide conditions that facilitate legitimacy. Game theory also suggests that Sustainability Appraisal is likely to deliver 'least worst' outcomes rather than best outcomes when the goals of the assessment process are considered; this may explain the propensity of such 'least worst' decisions in practise. On the basis of what can be learned from applying this game theory perspective, it is suggested that environmental assessment processes need to be redesigned and better integrated into decision making in order to guarantee the legitimacy of the decisions made.

AB  - Ski industry has become one of the main economic activities for many mountain regions worldwide. However, the economic viability of this activity is highly dependent of the interannual variability of the snow and climatic conditions, and it is jeopardized by climate warming. In this study, we reviewed the main scientific literature on the relationship between climate change and the ski feasibility under different climate change scenarios. In spite of the different methodologies and climate change scenarios used in the reviewed studies, their findings generally point to a significant impact of climate change on ski industry caused by a reduction in the natural availability of snow as well as a contraction in the duration of seasonal conditions suitable for ski. It emphasizes that the problem is real and should not be ignored in the study and management of tourism in mountain regions. However, there were significant differences in the impacts between different areas. These differences are mainly associated to the elevation of the ski resorts, their infrastructures for snowmaking and the various climate models, emission scenarios, time horizons and scales of analysis used. This review highlights the necessity from scientist to harmonize indicators and methodology thus allowing a better comparison of the results from different studies and increase the clarity of the conclusions transmitted to land managers and policy makers. Moreover, a better integration of the uncertainty in the model's outputs, as well as the treatment applied to the snowpack in ski slopes is necessary to provide more accurate indications on how this sector will respond to climate change.

AB  - Wood ash found at archaeological sites is the most direct evidence of the presence of combustion features. The preservation of wood ash within archaeological deposits is often poor due to diagenetic processes and therefore its identification requires the use of spectroscopic methods. FTIR spectrometry is able to detect the main calcite component of wood ash, unless this is mixed with other calcitic phases of geologic origin. Using FTIR spectrometry we identified non-biogenic aragonite in archaeological heataltered sediments and lime plasters. The presence of aragonite in such conditions is unusual, as it is unlikely to crystallize at ambient temperatures and pressures or in absence of Mg. The experimental conditions which favor the nucleation of this aragonite phase were investigated with FTIR spectrometry, XRPD and SEM imaging of modern lime plaster and quicklime samples prepared in the laboratory using different calcium carbonate starting materials. We show that aragonite forms at ambient temperatures and pressures upon carbonation of calcium oxide and calcium hydroxide together with calcite and its nucleation and growth are influenced by environmental parameters, such as carbon dioxide partial pressure, relative humidity and temperature. This pyrogenic aragonite is a reliable indicator for calcareous materials exposed to temperatures above 600 degrees C, and therefore it can be used to determine the presence of heat-altered sediments and ash in the absence of structured combustion features. This mineral phase could have applications in radiocarbon dating as well. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban areas have developed under anthropogenic impact and hence feature strongly altered environmental conditions that influence today's plant species distribution. Generally, urban areas are rich in plant species, but on smaller scales richness can vary considerably. Our study aim is to identify areas of high species richness and to assess richness distribution patterns in the city of Hamburg by analyzing a floristic mapping dataset on the scale of 1 km(2). Differences in plant species richness were analyzed between three urbanization zones. With multiple regression analyses, we tested effects of urban structure, habitat, and environmental conditions on the distribution of species richness measures. Total species richness per 1 km(2) was 274 +/- 60 on average and differed only slightly between the urbanization zones. It increased with habitat diversity and decreased with Ellenberg indicator values (EIV) for nutrients (multiple R-2 = 0.31). Proportion of non-native species increased with mean annual temperature and decreased with EIVs for moisture (multiple R-2 = 0.72), while proportion of endangered species increased with EIVs for moisture and decreased with EIVs for nutrients (multiple R-2 = 0.66). Proportion of thermophilic species (multiple R-2 = 0.58) could be explained by mean annual temperature. The emerging patterns probably differ from those in other cities due to the central port harboring a particular flora. Besides the expected high proportions of non-native species, high proportions of endangered species were also found in this area. Our results contribute to identifying drivers of biodiversity in cities and can thus be used to develop measures for the conservation of urban biodiversity.

AB  - A number of anthropogenic stressors, including land use change and intensive water use, have caused stream habitat deterioration in arid and semiarid climates throughout the western U.S. These often contribute to high stream temperatures, a widespread water quality problem. Stream temperature is an important indicator of stream ecosystem health and is affected by catchment-scale climate and hydrological processes, morphology, and riparian vegetation. To properly manage affected systems and achieve ecosystem sustainability, it is important to understand the relative impact of these factors. In this study, we predict relative impacts of different stressors using an integrated catchment-scale ecohydrological model that simulates hydrological processes, stream temperature, and fish growth. This type of model offers a suitable measure of ecosystem services because it provides information about the reproductive capability of fish under different conditions. We applied the model to Silver Creek, Idaho, a stream highly valued for its world-renowned trout fishery. The simulations indicated that intensive water use by agriculture and climate change are both major contributors to habitat degradation in the study area. Agricultural practices that increase water use efficiency and mitigate drainage runoff are feasible and can have positive impacts on the ecosystem. All of the mitigation strategies simulated reduced stream temperatures to varying degrees; however, not all resulted in increases in fish growth. The results indicate that temperature dynamics, rather than point statistics, determine optimal growth conditions for fish. Temperature dynamics are influenced by surface water-groundwater interactions. Combined restoration strategies that can achieve ecosystem stability under climate change should be further explored.

AB  - To estimate the behavior of ethanol-blended dissolved BTEX hydrocarbons in groundwater, a quantitative tracing study instead of qualitative analysis was carried out by using a large sand tank, into which 2-L solution including bromide, ethanol and dissolved BTEX was injected under a controlled hydraulic condition. Mean residence time (MRT), pore volume swept by solute (V (p)), retardation coefficient (R) and biodegradation rate constant (k) of injected solutes were estimated. Compared with bromide that was used as a conservative tracer, ethanol and BTEX had shorter MRT and smaller V (p) with the sequence of EtOH < T < E < m/p-X < o-X < B < Br. Biodegradation was confirmed as evidenced by the consumptions of dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate and sulfate, and the production of acetate. The sequence of k as EtOH > T > E > m/p-X > o-X > B was just opposite to the sequences of MRT and V (p). The relationship among above sequences implies that MRT and V (p) can be used as indicators to assess in situ biodegradability of a solute. Biodegradation of a reactive solute can make its MRT shortened and V (p) shrunk. In addition, the sorption of ethanol could be neglected (R = 1.0), whereas BTEX compounds were adsorbed (R = 1.04-1.15). It should be noted that biodegradation of a solute can affect the estimation of its retardation coefficient. To our knowledge, this paper provides an available route to quantitatively estimate biodegradability of a solute in groundwater.

AB  - Escherichia coli, an important fecal indicator bacterium, is known to persist and reproduce in association with Cladophora and other macrophytic algae and environmental substrates. Recent increases in the growth of Cladophora and other macrophytic algae in many of the Laurentian Great Lakes result in the accumulation of large amounts of algal biomass along the shoreline and on beaches. While the Cladophora-E. coli association may pose substantial public health risks, detailed laboratory-based studies have not been done to investigate the bases of the interaction. This is due, in large part, to past inabilities to culture many macrophytic algae under near axenic conditions. Here we describe the development and experimental use of laboratory microcosms to study the synergistic interaction and growth of the green alga Pithophora, a close relative of Cladophora, with environmental E. coli. In the absence of exogenous organic carbon supply, the E. coli population attached to algal filaments increased approximately three orders of magnitude within 72 h of inoculation. Growth of E. coli on Pithophora appeared to be limited by dissolved nitrogen with a concentration of >= 66 mu g/mL N allowing maximal bacterial growth. In contrast, an environmental strain of Salmonella did not grow under identical conditions in the microcosms, suggesting that this bacterium requires additional growth factors not provided by Cladophora. Since the alga can be maintained in the laboratory for long periods of time, this system allows for further experimentation and understanding of macroalga-microbe interactions.

AB  - A probabilistic model for predicting Enterobacter sakazakii inactivation in trypticase soy broth (TSB) and infant formula (IF) by high-pressure processing was developed. The modeling procedure is based on a previous model (S. Koseki and K. Yamamoto, Int. J. Food Microbiol. 116: 136-143, 2007) that describes the probability of death of bacteria. The model developed in this study consists of a total of 300 combinations of pressure (400, 450, 500, 550, or 600 MPa), pressure-holding time (1, 3, 5, 10, or 20 min), temperature (25 or 40 degrees C), inoculum level (3, 5, or 7 log(10) CFU/ml), and medium (TSB or IF), with each combination tested in triplicate. For each replicate response of E. sakazakii, survival and death were scored with values of 0 and 1, respectively. Data were fitted to a logistic regression model in which the medium was treated as a dummy variable. The model predicted that the required pressure-holding times at 500 MPa for a 5-log reduction in IF with 90% achievement probability were 26.3 and 7.9 min at 25 and 40 degrees C, respectively. The probabilities of achieving 5-log reductions in TSB and IF by treatment with 400 MPa at 25 degrees C for 10 min were 92 and 3%, respectively. The model enabled the identification of a minimum processing condition for a required log reduction, regardless of the underlying inactivation kinetics pattern. Simultaneously, the probability of an inactivation effect under the predicted processing condition was also provided by taking into account the environmental factors mentioned above.

AB  - Near-infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIRS) is widely used for routine, non-destructive assessment of grain quality in cereals. In this work, we assess the use of NIRS as an indirect indicator of grain yield (GY) in durum wheat grown in Mediterranean conditions. Plants were grown under rain-fed conditions in two sites in NW Syria, Breda and Tel Hadya, and a third trial was planted at Tel Hadya under support irrigation. We measured the spectral reflectance signature between 1100 and 2500 nm in flour from the same grains harvested for yield determination. By Partial Least Squares (PLSR), we obtained a model of the association between agronomic determinations of GY and these spectra. We found significant (p < 0.001) relationships between GY and NIRS-predicted values, with r(2) = 0.36 (N = 96), r(2) = 0.72 (N = 72) and r(2) = 0.52 (N = 138) in Breda, and Tel Hadya rainfed and irrigated, respectively. Full cross validation of these models gave r(2) between 0.31 and 0.33 (p < 0.001). When we applied the models to the samples from the other two trials, we found a general decrease in their predictive ability. Compared with other grain traits ( carbon isotope discrimination, grain weight, ash and nitrogen content), NIRS showed a similar or even stronger relationship with GY, at least when validated in the same trial. We concluded that NIRS could be used to rank GY during the early generations of a breeding program, when performing yield trials is less feasible. However, further research is required to identify the environments in which this technique is more reliable, as well as to evaluate the heritability of NIRS-predicted GY.

AB  - Agricultural soils with too little soil organic matter (SOM) content are characterized by fertility problems. A number of authors have tried to specify threshold values for SOM content to indicate what is 'too little', ranging from 1 to 5%, below which yields may be affected. How much SOM content is sufficient, however, depends on a number of environmental factors. In addition, up to date farmers' perceptions were not included when developing thresholds. Therefore, this study focuses on the following three objectives: (1) to identify a risk indicator on SOM deficiency based on environmental factors and agricultural land use; (2) to test the risk indicator using farmers' perceptions and (3) to establish threshold values for SOM content based on farmers' perceptions.
   For objective 1, literature was reviewed on effects of environmental factors and land use on SOM deficiency. Findings were combined into nine options for a risk indicator on SOM deficiency, mapped at European scale. For objective 2, a farm survey was done among 1452 arable farmers in five European countries (Belgium, Germany, Austria, Spain and Italy). Associations between perceived deficiency of SOM by farmers and environmental factors, land use and the risk indicator were investigated. For objective 3, farmers' perceptions on SOM deficiency were related to the average SOM content of their fields.
   Mapping the risk indicator at European scale gives a high to very high risk of SOM deficiency for 7 to 37% of European agricultural land, mainly located in Southern and Eastern Europe. Of the farmers in our survey, 18% perceived a high to very high SOM deficiency. A weak correlation was found between the risk indicator and farmers' perceptions of SOM deficiency (0.15-0.18, Spearman's rank correlation). Stronger relations were found between separate environmental factors and perceived SOM deficiency. Apparently, having a more extreme environmental condition for one factor gives a higher chance of perceiving a deficiency of SOM than a combination of moderate environmental conditions. Based on farmers' perceptions threshold intervals for SOM content were established (sand: 1.2-4.7%, loam: 0.6-2.6% and clay: 1.0-2.4%).
   If policies on SOM management want to include benefits for productive capacity, targeting areas with a relatively high risk of SOM deficiency, more extreme environmental conditions or with very low SOM contents (below the given threshold intervals) seems most promising.

AB  - Harpacticoids are an important component of meiofaunal assemblages in springs. No information so far has been available on harpacticoid assemblages of the Western Carpathian spring fens, unique biotopes of high conservation value which cover a very long gradient of mineral content of groundwater, due to the variable geological background setting. Spring fens are isolated habitats of different age which can be assessed by radiocarbon dating of their basal sediment layers. This enables to test a possible effect of habitat age on species composition and species richness. In this study, we examined harpacticoid assemblages in 50 permanent tree-less spring fens (helocrenes) in the Western Carpathians (Slovakia and Czech Republic) in terms of species composition, total abundance, species density, and species richness. We tested mainly the effect of 12 explanatory variables describing water chemistry and temperature, climatic conditions, amount of nutrients, organic carbon, sediment structure, habitat age and size, using Canonical Correspondence Analyses (CCA) with stepwise forward selection. For the computation of species richness rarefaction was used. In total, 20 harpacticoid species were recorded with the total median density of 950 individuals in m(-2). Three significant explanatory variables, Ellenberg Indicator Values of plant community for nutrients, in situ measured pH, and average January temperature, explained together 19.0% (adj. 13.7%) of the total variance in the species composition data. The relationships of harpacticoids to these three explanatory variables were species specific and no uniform response of the total assemblage to the environmental variables was found (in terms of total abundance and number of species). The only exception was the influence of overall unfavourable conditions in the mineral-poor acidic Sphagnum-fens. Pilocamptus pilosus was significantly associated with a higher amount of nutrients and warmer climate. Nutrient enrichment was clearly indicated by a decrease or absence of crenophile Bryocamptus cuspidatus, and accompanied by an increase in ubiquitous Attheyella crassa. Moraria brevipes was confined to low pH, B. cuspidatus showed a high tolerance for low pH, whereas Bryocamptus echinatus preferred alkaline conditions. Despite a significant correlation between habitat age and species density we found no clear evidence that any colonisation driven process could influence the number of harpacticoid species within the tested time scale. We hypothesize that rather other habitat characteristics connected with age, i.e. habitat heterogeneity and stability, may be determinant for species richness. The occurrence of some species (e.g. P. pilosus, B. cuspidatus) was clearly geographically limited, but due to the spatial structuring of significant environmental variables no conclusion on dispersal limitations could be made.

AB  - Globally, waterborne gastroenteritis attributable to rotaviruses is on the increase due to the rapid increase in population growth, poor socioeconomic conditions, and drastic changes in climatic conditions. The burden of diarrhea is quite alarming in developing nations where the majority of the populations still rely on untreated surface water that is usually polluted for their immediate water needs. Humans and animals of all ages are affected by rotaviruses. In humans, the preponderance of cases occurs in children under 5 years. Global efforts in advancing water/wastewater treatment technologies have not yet realized the objective of complete viral removal from wastewater. Most times, surface waters are impacted heavily by inadequately treated wastewater run-offs thereby exposing people or animals to preventable health risks. The relative stability of rotaviruses in aquatic matrices during wastewater treatment, poor correlation of bacteriological indicators with the presence of rotaviruses, and their infectiousness at a low dose informed the proposal for inclusion in the routine microbiological water screening panel. Environmental monitoring data have been shown to provide early warnings that can complement clinical data used to monitor the impact of current rotavirus vaccination in a community. This review was therefore undertaken to critically appraise rotavirus excretion and emission pathways, and the existence, viability and persistence in the receiving aquatic milieu. The efficiency of the current wastewater treatment modality for rotavirus removal, correlation of the current bacteriological water quality assessment strategy, public health risks and current laboratory methods for an epidemiological study were also discussed.

AB  - The archaeological investigations developed in the Cadiz coast and countryside during the last 25 years have revealed a series of human occupations dating between ca 8000-3000 cal BP and ranging culturally from Late Mesolithic until Late Bronze Age. Pollen analyses have revealed an open Mediterranean landscape developed under dry conditions drifting to steppic ones. Pinus, Juniperus, Olea and evergreen Quercus are the main arboreal taxa. Mesophilous (deciduous Quercus, Ulmus, Betula) and hygrophilous plants (Salix, Alnus), are present at the base (Mesolithic) as indicators of moister conditions. Nevertheless its presence is discontinuous and exiguous throughout most of the sequence recovering only during the Bronze Age. Charcoal assemblages reveal in turn the management of diverse plant communities. Olea europaea, deciduous and evergreen oak woodlands, Mediterranean pines (Pinus pinea, P. halepensis) and Juniperus appear interspersed in an open environment given the systematic exploitation of a varied set of shrubs and scrubs: Pistacia lentiscus, Arbutus unedo, Phillyrea sp., Crataegus, Prunus spp., Fabaceae and Erica sp.
   The E-W geographical position of sites between the Bays of Algeciras and C & acute;adiz, both separated by a series of mountainous alignments, determined the early development of the evergreen oak woodlands to the east over the deciduous oak communities which are more abundant westwards, due to the decreasing humidity gradient as going eastwards.
   The various sea level fluctuations occurred during the Holocene, also determined the trajectory and character of human occupations settled on the coast.

AB  - In most small-scale fisheries (SSF), there is limited or null information about the distribution and spatial extent of the fishing grounds where the fleets operate, due to the lack of explicit spatial and temporal data. This information is key when addressing marine spatial planning and fisheries management programs for SSF. In addition to technical or biogeographic restrictions, environmental conditions in the area influence the way fishers operate. Making use of data from a pilot Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) project tested in a small-scale fleet in the Southeastern Gulf of Mexico (SGoM), for the first time in the region, we were able to learn what role environmental factors play in the distribution of potential fishing grounds for this fleet. We got tracking information of 1,608 daily fishing trips from vessels operating in four states using the VMS for 7 months. We used a correlative modeling approach to identify potential fishing grounds where this fleet operates along the SGoM, accounting for environmental variables. We assumed that environmental conditions can shape the spatial distribution of species targeted by this fleet and hence influence fishers' operations. The results indicated that net primary production and sea surface temperature were the main drivers that shape the spatio-temporal potential distribution of fishing grounds in the study site. The approach employed here seems appropriated and opens an opportunity to learn more about the factors that define the spatial distribution of small-scale fleets and their potential fishing grounds.

AB  - Coral reefs at the northern extent of Florida's coral reef tract are exposed to many localized anthropogenic influences including controlled freshwater discharges, runoff, upwelling, and seasonal environmental variability. To better understand coral responses to sublethal stressors in nearshore environments, we conducted complementary experiments to assess the impacts of estuarine runoff and temperature stress on local populations of the scleractinian coral species, Montastraea cavernosa, using Tag-Seq global gene expression profiling. In an in situ time series experiment, fate tracked colonies were sampled during periods of relatively low and high estuarine discharge over 4 years to investigate temporal trends in transcriptional patterns and to identify if coral stress indicators were regulated through time. There was significant transcriptomic variation through time, but patterns did not appear to be attributed to distance from nearby estuarine tidal flux. In an ex situ factorial experiment, clonal replicates of coral genotypes were exposed to temperature (25 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and water (offshore and estuarine discharge, representing typical oceanic conditions and episodic discharge conditions, respectively) treatments to quantify the potential individual and synergistic effects of sublethal stress on coral and algal gene expression. Comparative analyses suggested that corals and their algal symbionts were more responsive to thermal stress than to estuarine discharge, although there was evidence of a synergistic relationship between the two stressors. Strong genotype effects also demonstrated that transcriptomic responses to thermal stress were largely based on coral genotype, indicating the potential for stress resilience among certain members of coral populations from southeast Florida.

AB  - The exhaust plume capture method is a commonly used approach to measure pollutants emitted by in-use heavy-duty diesel trucks. Lower cost sensors, if used in place of traditional research-grade analyzers, could enable wider application of this method, including use as a monitoring tool to identify high-emitting trucks that may warrant inspection and maintenance. However, low-cost sensors have for the most part only been evaluated under ambient conditions as opposed to source-influenced environments with rapidly changing pollutant concentrations. This study compared black carbon (BC) emission factors determined using different BC and carbon dioxide (CO2) sensors that range in cost from $200 to $20,000. Controlled laboratory experiments show that traditional zero and span steady-state calibration checks are not robust indicators of sensor performance when sampling short duration concentration peaks. Fleet BC emission factor distributions measured at two locations at the Port of Oakland in California with 16 BC/CO2 sensor pairs were similar, but unique sensor pairs identified different high-emitting trucks. At one location, the low-cost PP Systems SBA-5 agreed on the classification of 90% of the high emitters identified by the LI-COR LI-7000 when both were paired with the Magee Scientific AE33. Conversely, lower cost BC sensors when paired with the LI-7000 misclassified more than 50% of high emitters when compared to the AE33/LI-7000. Confidence in emission factor quantification and high-emitter identification improves with larger integrated peak areas of CO2 and especially BC. This work highlights that sensor evaluation should be conducted under application-specific conditions, whether that be for ambient air monitoring or source characterization.

AB  - Observing the isotopic evolution of snow meltwater helps in understanding the process of snow melting but remains a challenge to acquire in the field. In this study, we monitored the melting of two snowpacks near Baishui Glacier No. 1, a typical temperate glacier on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. We employed a physically based isotope model (PBIM) to calculate the isotopic composition of meltwater draining from natural snowpacks. The initial condition of the PBIM was revised to account for natural conditions, i.e., the initial delta O-18 stratigraphy of snow layers before melting. Simulations revealed that the initial heterogeneity of delta O-18 in snow layers as well as ice-liquid isotopic exchange were responsible for most variations of delta O-18 in snow meltwater, whereas new snow and wind drift could result in sudden changes of the isotopic composition of the meltwater. The fraction of ice involved in the isotopic exchange (f) was the most sensitive parameter for the model output. The initial delta O-18 in the snowpack is mirrored in meltwater in case of smallfand is smoothed with a large exchange fractionf. The other unknown parameter of the PBIM is the dimensionless rate constant of isotopic exchange, which depends on water percolation and initial snow depth. The successful application of the PBIM in the field might not only be useful for understanding snow melting process but might also provide the possibility of predicting the isotopic composition of snow meltwater and improve the accuracy of hydrograph separation.

AB  - Factors that strongly affect morphological features and reproductive effort of charophytes (Charophyta, Characeae) are the depth of occurrence and light availability. Eutrophication of waters and global warming change the level and transparency of waters. As a response to light limitation, an elongation of the charophyte thallus and a decrease in the number of mature oogonia with increasing depth have been reported. The object of this study was the globally endangered charophyte Lychnothamnus barbatus, the only living representative of the genus and a sensitive bioindicator of low trophic conditions. We hypothesised that (1) the morphological variability and (2) the number of mature oogonia decrease with increasing depth. The study was carried out in Lake Kuinickie, a mesotrophic lake in Western Poland, hosting a stable and abundant population of L. barbatus. At shallow sites (0.5 - 4.0 m), L. barbatus revealed high variability in weight and branching of the thallus. The individuals were less elongated and produced less mature oogonia than those from deep sites (5.0 - 6.5 m). The latter were more homogeneous and characterised by significantly elongated thalli and high fertility. The first hypothesis was confirmed, while the second was falsified. We suggest that L. barbatus forms two phenotypes, one less variable and better adapted to deep waters and the other more variable and better adapted to shallow, more changeable environments. This rare macroalga may optimise resource allocation depending on environmental conditions and its phenotypic plasticity may be a key adaptation to global changes.

AB  - We investigate the role of mixing, through its effect on nutrient and light availability, as a driver of phytoplankton community composition in the context of Margalefs mandala. Data on microstructure turbulence, irradiance, new nitrogen supply and phytoplankton composition were collected at 102 stations in three contrasting marine environments: the Galician coastal upwelling system of the northwest Iberian Peninsula, the northwestern Mediterranean, and the tropical and subtropical Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. Photosynthetic pigments concentration and microscopic analysis allowed us to investigate the contribution of diatoms, dinoflagellates, pico- and nanoeukaryotes, and cyanobacteria to the phytoplankton community. Simple linear regression was used to assess the role of environmental factors on community composition, and environmental overlap among different phytoplankton groups was computed using nonparametric kernel density functions. Mixing and new nitrogen supply played an important role in controlling the phytoplankton community structure. At lower values of mixing and new nitrogen supply cyanobacteria dominated, pico- and nanoeukaryotes were dominant across a wide range of environmental conditions, and finally enhanced new nitrogen supply was favourable for diatoms and dinofiagellates. Dinoflagellates were prevalent at intermediate mixing levels, Whereas diatoms spread across a wider range of mixing conditions. Occasional instances of enhanced diatom biomass were found under low mixing, associated with the high abundance of Hemiaulus hauckii co-occurring with high N-2 fixation in subtropical regions, and with the formation of thin layers in the Galician coastal upwelling. Our results verify the Margalef s mandala for the whole phytoplankton community, emphasizing the need to consider nutrient supply, rather than nutrient concentration, as an indicator of nutrient availability.

AB  - In order to determine the effective traits to improve seed yield in sesame (Sesamum indicum L.), an experimental using factorial split plot design was conducted with three replications in the experimental field of Agricultural Research Center, West-Azerbaijan (Saatloo Station) in the 2015 and 2016 cropping seasons. The main plots (factor A and B) consisted of three different levels of irrigations (normal irrigation: irrigation after 70 mm evaporation of crop or ETc, moderate drought stress: irrigation after 90 mm ETc and severe drought stress: irrigation after 110 mm ETc) and factor B included three levels: two species of mycorrhizal fungi Glomus mosseae, Glomus intraradices and noninoculated (control). Sub plots (factor C) consisted of eight commercial cultivars of sesame. The results showed high heritability most studied traits under different levels of drought stress, except for productivity effort. Estimation of variance components showed that under optimum conditions, all studied traits had high heritability and were less affected by environment. Path analysis showed positive significant correlations between seed yield and all studied traits. Progress in yield components can therefore increase seed yield in sesame. In general the research showed that the number of seed per capsule is one of the most important indicators of sesame seed yield under optimum irrigation. Also the traits such as 1000-seed weight and number of capsules per plant can be used as an option index in breeding programs for enhancing seed yield and selection of genotypes under optimum irrigation conditions, due to the high positive direct effect on seed yield. Under moderate and severe drought stress, the effective traits on seed yield were different in different species of mycorrizal.

AB  - The article considers approaches to the measurement of precarious employment for numerous studies suggest various ways to estimate its scale based on empirical data. To systematize various methodological solutions, the author identifies three approaches to the measurement of precarization: at the macro-, meso- and micro-level. Each approach is described and illustrated with examples from Russian and foreign scientific literature. The first approach (at the macro-level) studies the prevalence of specific indicators of precarization in dynamics or different social-demographic groups that can be considered precariat. The second approach (at the meso-level) compares different types of non-standard and standard employment in terms of the quality of jobs and working conditions to identify types of employment that can be considered precarious. The third approach (at the micro-level) focuses on the individual employment instability, its subjective perception, lack of employment security, and develops precarization indices. The comparison of indicators within such indices allows to identify common components of precarization: characteristics of wages, social and legal protection, and feeling of insecurity. The article emphasizes features of each approach for the measurement of precarization: the first takes into account not only the employed population but also other categories; the second compares groups representing different types of employment but does not take into account the internal heterogeneity of these groups and considers them as having a high or low level of precarization; this disadvantage is overcome in the third approach that measures precarization at the individual level and takes into account not only types and conditions of work but also voluntary/forced nature of employment.

TI  - Accounting for environmental and observer effects in estimating abundance of southern bluefin tuna from aerial survey data
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - SPATIAL MODELS
AB  - Southern bluefin tuna (SBT) is a valuable species that has been subject to high exploitation rates since the 1950s. In 2011, the spawning stock biomass was estimated to be at a historically low level, at only 5% of pre-fished biomass. A key component for managing and rebuilding the stock is having reliable, fishery-independent estimates of juvenile abundance. This paper describes how such estimates have been constructed from aerial surveys of juvenile (age 2-4) SBT conducted annually in the Great Australian Bight from 1993-2000 and 2005-2009. During these surveys, observers flew along pre-set transect lines searching for surface schools of SBT. Data were collected on the location and biomass of SBT sightings, and on the environmental conditions present during the survey. Sea surface temperature (SST) was found to correlate with the size (biomass) of schools, and several environmental variables, SST and wind speed in particular, were found to correlate with the number of sightings (presumably by affecting the ability of observers to see surface schools as well as whether fish were present at the surface). In addition, observers changed over time and differed in their aptitude for spotting tuna. Thus, generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were used to standardize the sightings and biomass data to a common set of observers and environmental conditions in order to produce an annual time series of relative abundance estimates. These estimates, which form one of two key inputs to the management procedure used by the international Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna to set the global catch quota, suggest juvenile abundance was highest in the first years of the survey (1993-1996), after which it declined and fluctuated around a level about four times lower.

AB  - The paper presents results of measurements and analysis on partial discharge (PD) behaviour in mineral oil under long-term AC voltage. The conventional electrical method is applied for apparent charge measurements. Surface PDs are generated by model source immersed in brand new and 35-year used mineral oil respectively. The high voltage (HV) electrode is 1cm thick brass plate with a diameter of 3 cm, while the grounded (GND) electrode is 1cm thick steel plate with a diameter of 12 cm. There is also a square solid dielectric barrier made of 8 mm thick pressboard oil impregnated paper and the size of 15cm x 15cm placed between the both electrodes. The PD source is powered continuously by the AC voltage with its relative level of 1.3 of the inception voltage (U-i) of the PD source within 168 hours. Signals generated by the continuously occurred PDs within 168 hours are registered. Various qualitative as well as quantitative indicators describing the PD variability in time are assigned and compared to different oil conditions. Furthermore some long-term characteristics of the applied PD model source in mineral oils of different condition are also presented. Finally statistical tools are applied for the results analysis and presentation. From among all assigned indicators there are discriminated those that depend as well as not depend on PD long-term duration. Based on the regression models analysis there are discovered trends that potentially allow to apply the results for modeling of the PD variability in time. Subsequently such approach may potentially support the development and extend the abilities of the diagnostic tools and maintenance policy in electrical power industry.

AB  - The conservation of semi-natural habitats represents a primary challenge for European nature conservation due to their great species diversity and their vulnerability to ongoing massive land-use changes. As these changes rapidly transform and phase out semi-natural habitats, conservation measures should be prompt and specifically focused on a sound assessment of the degree of conservation. Here we develop a methodological strategy for the assessment of the degree of conservation of semi-natural grasslands based on well-defined criteria rather than on expert opinion. Through mixed effect models, we tested ten potential indicators, encompassing proxies of species composition, habitat structure, and landscape patterns, against a measure of compositional change from habitat favourable condition, i.e., an inverse proxy of conservation status. This measure derives from the re-visitation of 132 sampling units historically sampled between 1966 and 1992 along the Apennines. The compositional change was quantified as the dissimilarity between historical habitat species pools and the composition of current communities. The compositional change was significantly related to the number of habitat diagnostic species and the relative cover of woody species with opposite sign (positive and negative, respectively). We classified and combined the classes of these two indicators in each sampling unit to assess the habitat degree of conservation at the plot and at the Natura 2000 site level. At the plot level, our assessment was in good agreement with the occurrence of species of conservation concern. On the other hand, at the site level, our assessment was not always harmonic with the habitat conservation assessment officially reported for the site investigated.

AB  - In this research paper, we define and test an ELECTRE III-based approach to the construction of non compensatory composite indicators; these indicators are used for the evaluation of environmental and social performances of urban and regional planning policies. We tested the methodology for the construction of the Land-Use Policy Efficiency Index (LUPEI) on the municipal scale applied to a sample of municipalities in the Apulia Region (Southern Italy). Based on the literature review concerning composite indicators, we found that linear aggregation rules are the most widely applied aggregation procedures for composite indicators. However, their applicability depends on a set of strong theoretical and operational conditions. If these conditions do not hold, then other aggregation and weighting procedures must be applied to construct the composite indicators. We tested the ELECTRE III via a fruitful interaction with three experts who were participating in a focus group. We found that composite indicators are powerful tools when it comes to the assessment of multidimensional planning issues. Since each sub-indicator provides different information and responds to different goals, rankings and assessment based on mono-indicator frameworks can lead to incomplete or even biased results that do not consider an integrated approach to land-use policy efficiency. Moreover, both experts and decision-makers appreciated the role of composite indicators in increasing knowledge and providing deeper insights into complex phenomeria in the domains of urban and regional planning.

AB  - Pyrolysis of dried sewage sludge is regarded as an effective treatment method as well as a promising technology for energy/fuel production. In this work, thermochemical conversion of dried sewage sludge in a continuous reactor at different pyrolysis temperatures (400-800 degrees C) and solid residence times (6-46 min) was conducted. The pyrolysis products obtained using different pyrolysis conditions were extensively investigated. It is indicated that high pyrolysis temperature (>700 degrees C) and long solid residence time (>23 min) could enhance secondary reactions and decrease the yield of bio-oil. The maximum yield of bio-oil of 16.69% was achieved at reaction temperature of 700 degrees C and solid residence time of 23 min. The FTIR and GC-MS analyses of the bio-oil obtained at optimum condition indicated that it contained large amounts of phenols and esters. H-2 and CO2 were the main components of pyrolysis gas, with a total amount that exceeded 52.18%. The characteristics of the char, including elemental composition, functional groups, and combustion property were investigated by XRF, FTIR, and TG. FTIR analysis of the char showed that the main functional groups are M-X, C-O, and C-H. The volatile content in the char decreased with an increase of pyrolysis temperature, while it increased with an increase of solid residence time. Heavy metals distribution in pyrolysis products of dried sewage sludge were investigated by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. The results showed that most of the heavy metals remained in char. In addition, the potential ecological risk assessment of heavy metals was assessed.

The review of the data on the isotopic age of hosting deposits showed that the Ust'-Il'ya Formation is of the Early Riphean in age which are currently evaluated as 1750 +/- 10-1400 Ma. Relatively large and morphologically complex eukaryotic forms present in the Ust'-Il'ya Formation served in due time as the basis for an erroneous conclusion on the Late Riphean age of the specified formation and the overlying Lower Kotuikan Subformation of the Anabar Uplift. The paper provides a global comparative analysis of the Early Riphean microbiotas, demonstrates the position of the Ust'-Il'ya and Kotuikan microbiotas amidst the microbiotas of the same age, and shows that the relatively large acanthomorphic acritarchs Tappania, Valeria, Dictiosphaera, Satka, and Shuiyousphaeridium appeared in the geological history already during the Early Riphean Erathem. Moreover, the paper discusses the recently published data on the distribution of aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the Early Riphean paleobasins and provides the conclusion on the impact of the lateral change of these conditions on the taxonomic composition of the microbiota.

AB  - Estuarine systems play an important role in the transportation and transformation of organic pollutants from rivers. Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE), organochlorine pesticide (OCP), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations in water of the Jiulong River Estuary (JRE), China, were investigated to characterize their distribution, possible source, and potential ecological risk as well as the influencing factors. The total concentrations of PBDEs, OCPs, and PAHs varied from 5.2 to 12.3 pg L-1, from 29.1 to 96.4 ng L-1, and from 28.6 to 48.5 ng L-1, respectively. Their compositions were all consistent at different stations; even the input pathways were multifarious. A source analysis showed that PBDEs may come from the flame retardant usages of penta-BDE and deca-BDE; hexachlorocyclohexane isomers (HCHs) were from the use of technical HCHs, while DDTs were attributed to early residuals of industrial sources, and PAHs were mainly from pyrolytic sources. The spatial distributions of PBDEs and OCPs were quite similar with their concentrations, decreasing along the estuary and then increasing when passing the Xiamen Harbor. PAH concentrations were similar along the whole estuary, suggesting that local sources and hydrological conditions might be the influencing factors. The concentrations of these pollutants changed with tidal conditions and were positively correlated with SPM, DOC, and chlorophyll a but negatively correlated with salinity. The ecological risk assessment revealed that OCPs and PAHs posed slightly higher potential risks to aquatic organism in the study area.

AB  - The Huadian Basin is a small fault-controlled basin in northeast China. It is filled by the Eocene Huadian Formation comprising thick lacustrine oil shale-and coal-bearing sediments. Oil shale, mudstone and carbonaceous shale samples have been collected to determine their mineralogical and geochemical (major, trace and rare earth elements) characteristics. These data are used to evaluate sediment provenance as well as paleoclimate and depositional environment. The fine-grained sediments in the Huadian Formation are derived from felsic volcanic rocks and granites, mixed with minor amounts of mafic and sedimentary rocks. Geo-chemical proxies confirm sediment recycling in the source region. Clay mineralogy and indices of chemical alteration suggest that a subtropical warm and humid climate prevailed during deposition of the fine-grained sediments. The data also suggest climatic changes during deposition of the Huadian Formation, from a stable warm and humid climate causing intermediate chemical weathering (Pyrite Member), to a seasonal dry-wet climate (Oil Shale Member), to a stable warmer and more humid climate causing strong chemical weathering (Carbonaceous Shale Member). Based on inorganic proxies, the fine-grained sediments in the Huadian Formation have been deposited in an anoxic fresh-water environment. Only the sediments of the Oil Shale Member reflect fluctuating freshwater and brackish conditions. The Eocene climatic change controlled lake level variations and water chemistry. A brackish and strictly anoxic environment together with a warm and humid climate was beneficial for the formation of high quality oil shale, whereas fresh-water conditions and warm and more humid climate favored peat accumulation.

AB  - Prairie pothole wetlands are subject to large year-to-year and decadal variability of precipitation, resulting in large variations in ponded area, plant communities and ecological functionality that obscure trends in wetland conditions caused by changes in climate and land use. Descriptions and analyses of these variations and trends require practical and objective definitions of pothole wetlands that can be used to establish the boundaries of individual wetlands, detect long-term changes of these boundaries, and distinguish wetlands from lakes and from small non-wetland depressions. The boundaries of prairie pothole wetlands should ideally be defined on the basis of wetland soils, which are more stable and persistent than vegetation and ponded water. The latter are necessarily used as indicators of wetland conditions through time because they are amenable to remote sensing and regional wetland inventories. However, the relationships between wetland ponds, vegetation and soil zones need improved documentation. Wetlands are persistent and stable landscape features (unless they are drained or filled). Some ecological functions of wetlands such as waterbird habitat may be seasonal, but other important hydrological and biochemical functions act year-round whether or not a pond is present. Phrases such as "seasonal wetland" that refer to the duration of ponded water should be avoided and terms such as "wetland", "depression" and "pond" should be used with clear definitions that are accepted across the wetland disciplines. Commonly used wetland classifications based on vegetation zones and duration and salinity of ponds should incorporate reference to the decadal-scale time period for which the descriptions apply.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxic effects of chlorpyrifos (CPF) at environmental concentrations on the shrimp Palaemonetes argentinus, a South American native species. Organisms were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of CPF (from 3.5 to 94.5 ng CPF L-1) at laboratory conditions for 96 h. A wide battery of biochemical responses including bioaccumulation, damage and defense biomarkers were measured in cephalothorax and abdomen of shrimp.
   The concentration of CPF was below the detection limit of the method in both body sectors (8 ng CPFg(-1) ww), probably indicating fast biotransformation of the parental compound. Our results showed that CPF exposure inhibits acetylcholinesterase activity from 3.5 ng CPF L-1, a concentration below the suggested Argentinean guidelines for the protection of aquatic biota. Moreover, oxidative stress was evidenced by increased H2O2 content and increased levels of TBARs and carbonyl groups in proteins. The induction of antioxidant enzymes like catalase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase seems not be sufficient to prevent oxidative damages. In addition, the mobilization of alpha-tocopherol from abdomen to cephalothorax was observed and reported for the first time in non-reproductive condition. Likewise, a strong diminution of metallothioneins occurred in cephalothorax from the lowest CPF concentration while induction occurred from the same treatment in abdomen as an oxidative stress response. Finally, significant correlation between Integrated Biomarker Response values and exposure concentrations suggest the usefulness of P. argentinus as bioindicator of CPF exposure at concentrations as low as environmental ones.

AB  - 4,4'-Diaminodiphenylmethane (MDA) is a widely used compound in industries. Studies on the biodegradability of MDA are necessary for environmental hazard identification and risk assessment. Previous studies have suggested that MDA was not readily biodegradable. In the present study, three batches of biodegradation tests (OECD 301A, B, D and F tests) were performed on MDA in June, August and December of 2012. MDA was found to be readily biodegradable and produced colored intermediates in the 301A, B and F test systems. MDA biodegradation measurements were consistent among the three batches of tests. Differences in the extent of biodegradation determined in different methods originated from different test conditions and assessment endpoints. The 301D test has stringent test conditions and is usually performed on chemicals that are toxic to microorganisms, so the test results obtained from 301D tests are less meaningful for evaluating the biodegradability of MDA. The low MDA biodegradation measurements in the 301B tests compared to the 301A and F tests were due to the assessment method, which did not account for MDA incorporation into biomass in its calculation of CO2 formation rate. The differences in the biodegradation rates, as measured by the different OECD 301 test systems, could also be related to the structure and properties of the chemical. For test substances that can be assessed by all OECD 301 test methods, the highest biodegradation values may be obtained from the 301A and F test methods. This study provides new information to assess the environmental fate in the risk assessment of MDA. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Commonalities and complementarities among approaches to conservation monitoring and evaluation (M&E) are not well articulated, creating the potential for confusion, misuse, and missed opportunities to inform conservation policy and practice. We examine the relationships among five approaches to conservation M&E, characterizing each approach in eight domains: the focal question driving each approach, when in the project cycle each approach is employed, scale of data collection, the methods of data collection and analysis, the implementers of data collection and analysis, the users of M&E outputs, and the decisions informed by these outputs. Ambient monitoring measures status and change in ambient social and ecological conditions, independent of any conservation intervention. Management assessment measures management inputs, activities, and outputs, as the basis for investments to build management capacity for conservation projects. Performance measurement assesses project or program progress toward desired levels of specific activities, outputs, and outcomes. Impact evaluation is the systematic process of measuring the intended and unintended causal effects of conservation interventions, with emphasis upon long-term impacts on ecological and social conditions. Systematic review examines existing research findings to assess the state of the evidence regarding the impacts of conservation interventions, and to synthesize the insights emerging from this evidence base. Though these five approaches have some commonalities, they complement each other to provide unique insights for conservation planning, capacity-building, adaptive management, learning, and accountability. Ambient monitoring, management assessment, and performance measurement are now commonplace in conservation, but opportunities remain to inform conservation policy and practice more fully through catalytic investments in impact evaluations and systematic reviews.

AB  - Palaeoclimatic and paleoenvironmental high latitude records in the Southern Hemisphere are scarce compared to the northern counterpart. However, understanding global evolution of environmental systems during sudden climate changes is inseparable from an equivalent knowledge of both Hemispheres. In this context, a high-resolution study of lacustrine sediments from Laguna Potrok Aike, Santa Cruz province, Patagonia, Argentina, was conducted for the Lateglacial period using concurrent X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Scanning electron microscope analyses. Peaks of Ca/Si and Mn, and occurrences of the green alga Phacotus lenticularis have been interpreted as variations in ventilation of the water column from 13.6 to 11.1 ka cal. BP. During this interval, mild climate conditions during the Younger Dryas are characterized by relatively weak westerlies favouring the formation of a stratified water body as indicated by preserved manganese and Ca/Si peaks and high Total Organic Carbon (TOC) values. In this environment, water in the epilimnion can reach sufficiently high temperature to allow P. lenticularis to grow. Colder conditions are marked by peaks in Ca without P. lenticularis and occur during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR). In this Lateglacial interval, micropumices were also detected in large amount. Image analysis of thin sections allowed the counting and size measurement of detrital particles and micropumices separately. Micropumices significantly influence the iron and titanium content, hence preventing to use them as proxies of detrital input in this interval. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - For sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) crops, the effects of an environmental stress, especially water deficiency may cause severe productivity reduction, inferring negatively in the sugarcane industry. The tolerance of two sugarcane cultivars to a lack of water was made by analyzing the levels of the osmoprotectors, trehalose and free praline, and the biometrical variables of their initial growth. Biochemical and physiological responses of the cultivars, when subjected to water stress, were assayed to determine how these plants tolerate drought. The study was conducted in an acclimatized greenhouse (29.7 +/- 4.3 degrees C and 75.0 +/- 10.1% relative humidity) during 100 days and was divided into random blocks using a factorial 2 x 3 x 2 design (sugarcane cultivars x water availability x time periods) with four replicates. Forty days after germination, sugarcane was planted in pots (12 dm(3)) containing topsoil material taken from a medium textured Rhodic Ferralsol, submitted to three levels of water availability (WAS): 55% (control), 40% (moderate stress) and 25% (severe stress), for 60 days. The effect of the WAS on the accumulation of trehalose and free praline was detected in both cultivars, although it was found to be more distinctive for the cv. IAC91-5155. Trehalose and free praline are biochemical and physiological indicators of water deficiency The CV. IAC91-5155 had altered growth and allocation of biomass when subjected to severe water stress conditions. The univariate and the multivariate analysis of the biochemical and physiological responses, presented by the IAC91-5155 cultivar, indicate relative tolerance to drought conditions.

AB  - Variations in the concentrations of naturally occurring isotopes in rainfall provide a "continuous" signal that has the potential to generate more information on how weather conditions control solute transport than traditional field tracer experiments. An isotopically distinct rainfall event can be rapidly transferred through the system when preferential flow occurs. The objective of this study was to develop and test an approach for analyzing how rainfall and soil moisture control preferential transport to tile drains. An episodic solute transit time distributions model that accounts for these effects was developed. The model was tested on artificial data (daily values of tile drain discharge and O-18 concentrations in the drainage water) generated by the MACRO model for soils with different potentials for preferential flow. The results showed that the transit time model gave an excellent fit to the artificial data for the soil with a high potential for preferential flow. The dynamics of the preferential flow events were well captured also for the soil with medium potential for preferential flow but the magnitude was sometimes poorly simulated. Once the model parameter values have been determined, the model can be used to calculate the amount and distribution with time of preferential flow to tile drains for all daily rainfall data. Model calculations integrate the soil's potential for preferential flow and the effects of weather conditions and are, therefore, highly relevant as site-specific indicators for the risk of preferential leaching of agrochemicals. The approach needs to be evaluated against real field data, however, before its usefulness can be established.

AB  - The optimal design and operation of cogeneration and trigeneration systems for buildings applications is a complex issue, which has been investigated by several different approaches. Both the two basic management strategies, namely heat-tracking and electricity-tracking, have advantages and drawbacks in terms of operating results and may lead the plant designer either to undersize or oversize the CHP unit with respect to the optimal lay-out. Experimental works have demonstrated how the actual on-site performance of small-scale poly-generation systems significantly differs from their expected operation, due to the need for a regular plant operation and the effects of outages for scheduled or unscheduled maintenance activities. After pointing out that heuristic approaches based on demand duration curve are weak instruments for plant design optimization, a more refined method is proposed, based on realistic operating conditions. The method integrates results of previous researches, like the proven convenience in using a duration curve of the "aggregate thermal demand" and in adopting flexible and techno-economically feasible management strategies; it is also based on original indicators to be used for the real time optimization of plant operation. The proposed hybrid management criterion represents a good compromise between profit-oriented and emergo-environment-oriented solutions, ensuring the combined production system to be eligible for support mechanisms. Finally, the method is applied for demonstrative purposes to a large hotel situated in Italy; implementing the innovative phases of the method by successive steps allowed to recognize what margins for profitability and energy saving each phase provides, (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Senecio aquaticus is an esteemed wetland species. but it is also a poisonous species in grasslands for forage production of various countries (e.g. Great Britain and Central European states), and its further spread onto farmland must be prevented. To reveal links between management practice and the occurrence of S. aquaticus, a survey was carried out on agricultural grassland in the summer of 2005.
   Location: The Mountain region in the northern and central part of Switzerland.
   Methods: Botanical assessments were carried out on management units (parcels) where S. aquaticus occurred and on neighbouring parcels without occurrence. For all parcels, we analysed the soil nutrients and the details of management such as intensity of fertilisation and defoliation frequency.
   Results: There was a high risk of S. aquaticus occurrence in parcels with low nitrogen fertilisation, a change of management intensity in the preceding 15 years, high inclination, and gaps in the sward. The change in the vegetation composition caused by altering the management intensity most probably provided gaps in the sward. which were then colonised by S. aquaticus. A novel finding is that. despite its preference for low-nutrient sites. the species was also persistent at sites with a moderate to high management intensity.
   Conclusion: A long-term control of S. aquaticus on agricultural grasslands can best be achieved by avoiding sward damage and by promoting dense and stable swards. The management should be adjusted to the local environmental conditions and the requirements of the favourable plant species. This could prevent the spread of S. aquaticus from the protected wetlands onto agricultural grasslands, where the species would threaten animal health.

AB  - 1. In Australia, the carp Cyprinus carpio L. is regarded as a threat to the native fish and the aquatic environment. In recent years, Botany Wetlands, a significant coastal wetland in the Sydney region, has been invaded by the undesirable cyprinids, carp and goldfish (Carrasius auratus L.).
   2. In 1996 a cyprinid removal programme commenced at Botany Wetlands with the objective of managing the invasive species, increasing fish diversity, reducing cyanobacterial blooms and hence enhancing the aquatic habitat. Using electrofishing and gill netting, 4073 carp and 261 goldfish, amounting to 10 117 kg of cyprinid biomass were removed between 1996 and 2004. The captured carp ranged from 60 to 835 mm. Males matured before females. Carp between 350 and 680 mm, in length grew at the rate of 1.66 +/- 0.38 g day(-1).
   3. The success of the programme was monitored by assessing four indicators related to carp populations and two related to habitat. The former included the pattern of length-frequency distribution, mean weight per size class, condition factor (CF) and the catch per unit effort (CPUE), and the latter the Secchi disc transparency and cyanobacterial counts. After 8 yr of removal, the plots of carp length-frequency distribution flattened, CIF decreased from 2.86 to 1.82 and CPUE decreased from 97 kg day(-1) to 50 kg day(-1). A 10-fold decrease occurred in cyanobacterial counts and the Secchi disc transparency increased by 20%. More than 20000 fingerlings of native Australian bass Macquaria novemaculeata (S.) have been introduced to the wetlands, increasing the potential for juvenile carp predation and biodiversity.

AB  - In this study, we examined the qualitative changes in macroalgal assemblages during the climatic phenomena of drought and rainy season in 45 sampling stations along Estero de Urias in the Gulf of California. The lagoon has a mouth that connects it to the ocean, but there is no continuous supply of fresh water, and physico-chemical characteristics are highly influenced by the contrasting weather in this region. The ratio of green algae versus total species per sampling station was used as an indicator of change in organic enrichment. The ratio was high during both seasons, and the nutrient concentration averaged 14.8 mug at N/L and 1.0 muM dissolved-P during the drought and 12.4 mug at N/L and 1.7 muM dissolved-P during the rainy season, showing that the estuary has constant high levels of nutrients in both seasons. However, the average number of species per sampling station, and the number of stations with macroalgae were both larger during the drought season, mainly with Ulva lactuca, U. lobata and Enteromorpha clathrata. In contrast. during the rainy season the assemblages in some parts of the estuary are dominated by red seaweeds such as Gracilariopsis sjoestedtii and Caloglossa leprieurii. Moreover, in spite of the drought season (when it is not possible to observe clear assemblages), during the rainy season four main groups of stations were established by means of a classification analysis based upon the number of species that occur in the different stations. It seems that during the drought the system is environmentally more homogeneous than during the rains, when there is a slight improvement of water conditions, and different environmental zones are established.

AB  - Background: Regional brain perfusion in patients during alcohol-withdrawal has been relatively less studied with brain SPECT technique. In this study, the hypothesis that possible regional cerebral bloodflow (rCBF) alterations due to alcohol withdrawal might be transitory in a homogenous group of alcoholic patients in terms of their physical-nutritional and cognitive functional conditions was investigated.
   Methods: Fifteen right-handed male inpatients with alcohol-withdrawal, diagnosed according to DSM-IIIR criteria, and 6 male physically-mentally healthy control subjects were included in the study. The first Technetium 99m-hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime (Tc-99m-HMPAO) brain SPECT investigation was performed on the day of admission in nonmedicated conditions and the second one was performed after all the withdrawal symptoms had subsided ill the patients, As an indicator of the change in the brain perfusion, a relative perfusion index was used and the relative tracer activity was expressed as the ratio of, mean cortical region of interest activity to mean the whole cortical brain activity.
   Results: We found significantly reduced left frontal and right frontal, parietal and temporal rCBF values in the patients during the alcohol-withdrawal compared to those of their remitted stare while they were not different from in the control group (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Our data indicate that the alterations in rCBF during the alcohol-withdrawal are more pronounced both in the frontal cortex and in overall right hemisphere regions, Furthermore, the frontal hypoperfusion may be transitory with recovery from alcohol-withdrawal whereas temporal hypoperfusion? may continue after recovery probably depending on the previously administered high-dose benzodiazepines.

AB  - To look for new refrigerants replacing R134a, environmentally friendly refrigerants R1234yf and R1234ze(E) were chosen as the alternatives in an ejector refrigeration system. The tested system contained a single-phase ejector, and numerical analysis regarding the performance of the ejector was done by CFD. The entrainment ratio, static pressure and Mach number were chosen as indicators revealing the ejector performance. Changes of the indicators of ejector utilizing a given refrigerant under varying operating temperature conditions were analysed. With the increasing condenser temperature, the shocking position moved upstream until it combined with the first series of oblique shocks. With the increasing generator temperature, the entrainment ratio increased firstly and decreased subsequently. With the increasing evaporator temperature, the primary-fluid jet expansion weakened. Comparisons of the indicators of ejector utilizing three working fluids (R134a, R1234yf and R1234ze(E)) under a given operating temperature condition were also made. The results showed that R1234yf had a greater entrainment ratio than R134a and R1234ze(E). But the shocking position of R1234yf was also closer to the upstream than the other two refrigerants, which caused the smaller critical mode region. Compared with the entrainment ratio close to 1.4 times, the critical temperature difference of only 3 degrees C could not weaken the advantages of R1234yf. Besides, heat transfer inside the ejector was considered and not much different trends with the three working fluids were found. Therefore, R1234yf could be the better candidate for R134a in the ejector refrigeration system.

AB  - The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH region) is a major crop-producing region of China suffering from environment deterioration. Land fallowing policy is widely used as the solution of agriculture-related environment pollution, while it is difficult to derive a quantitative basis for policy-making. An indicator system was established to quantitatively analyse economic and environmental benefits of land fallow policies in the BTH region. The system consisted of 8 indicators to describe the water, air and economic influences caused by land fallowing policy such as the amount of nutrient discharged, the emission of PM2.5-related and greenhouse gas, and the input and output of agriculture production. SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) and IAP-N (Improving Anthropogenic Practices of managing reactive Nitrogen) models were used to quantify environmental indicators. Five scenarios with different planting patterns and fallow intensities were simulated for five years with different hydrological conditions. It is found that the influence of policy on water environment is highly sensitive to hydrological conditions, while the influence on air environment and economy are more affected by different policy settings in scenarios. The marginal utilities of the fallowed area are indicator-dependent. Planting alternative crops can decrease production costs and keep crop yields, while may also cause atmospheric environmental pollution if the crops have nitrogen fixing ability. Indicators also have spatial and temporal heterogeneity under different planting patterns and fallow intensities. A policy evaluation and associated uncertainty analysis is essential for effective implementation.

AB  - The large current flowing through transformer windings during external short-circuit events causes strong vibration, and the tank emits multi-frequency sound. This paper investigates the transient acoustic signal theoretically and experimentally and proposes to monitor the winding condition with the spectrum of the acoustic signal. A two-wire model is first built as a basic unit of winding structure. The dynamic equation of the model is constructed based on the principle of least action. The coupling action between the electromagnetic force and the motion of the wires is described as the second-order term of the wire spacing in the equation. The solution shows that the spectrum of the winding vibration contains half power frequency and its multiples in some cases. If the winding is loosened and deformed, the motion space and vibration amplitude would be enlarged, and the natural frequency of winding would decrease. As a result, the vibration spectrum would contain half frequency and its odd multiples. Then, the acoustic signal of a 110-kV transformer is measured on a multiple short-circuit test platform. The acoustic time-frequency spectrums are consistent with the theoretical analysis. The half frequency ratio (HFR) of the acoustic spectrum raises along with the increase of short-circuit times. After 21 short-circuits, the HFR raises obviously, indicating serious deformation of the winding, while no obvious change is found in the short-circuit reactance (SCR). The results prove that the HFR of acoustic signal is a more sensitive indicator than SCR, which can characterize the cumulative process of short-circuit on the winding.

AB  - The Pearl River Delta (PRD) in China is severely affected by intensive human activities. In this study, we used surficial sediments collected in its Lingding Bay (LDB) in December 2016 to analyse the grain size and organic carbon composition and to identify the recent human impact recorded in the sediments. We examined the temporal variations in the spatial distribution of the grain size and organic elemental geochemistry of the surficial sediments by comparison with previous studies. Our study shows that in 2016, there were several patches of coarse-grained sediments, which were not consistent with the hydrodynamic conditions in LDB. Compared with the organic carbon composition in 2005-2006, the delta C-13 values in 2016 were more negative and the contribution of terrigenous organic matter (TOM) to the surficial sediments was significantly greater. There were also several patches of high TOM values in the outer LDB. The overall coarser sediments and lighter delta C-13 of organic carbon were in contrast to the decline in the riverine sediment supply and the increased eutrophication in recent decades. Furthermore, the anomalous patches of coarse-grained sediments and terrestrially sourced organic carbon were mainly distributed in the navigation channels and on their adjacent shoals, reflecting channel dredging, dumping, and sand mining activities. Therefore, the origins and spatial distributions of the grain size and organic carbon composition of the surficial sediments in LDB in 2016 were not controlled by hydrodynamic conditions and land-sea interactions, but overwhelmingly by human activities. We suggest that LDB of PRD exemplifies an anthropogenically controlled bay.

AB  - The relationship between the climate and agricultural production is of considerable importance to global food security. However, there has been relatively little exploration of climate-variability related yield shocks. The short observational yield record does not adequately sample natural inter-annual variability thereby limiting the accuracy of probability assessments. Focusing on the United States and China, we present an innovative use of initialised ensemble climate simulations and a new agro-climatic indicator, to calculate the risk of severe water stress. Combined, these regions provide 60% of the world's maize, and therefore, are crucial to global food security. To probe a greater range of inter-annual variability, the indicator is applied to 1400 simulations of the present day climate. The probability of severe water stress in the major maize producing regions is quantified, and in many regions an increased risk is found compared to calculations from observed historical data. Analysis suggests that the present day climate is also capable of producing unprecedented severe water stress conditions. Therefore, adaptation plans and policies based solely on observed events from the recent past may considerably under-estimate the true risk of climate-related maize shocks. The probability of a major impact event occurring simultaneously across both regions-a multi-breadbasket failure-is estimated to be up to 6% per decade and arises from a physically plausible climate state. This novel approach highlights the significance of climate impacts on crop production shocks and provides a platform for considerably improving food security assessments, in the present day or under a changing climate, as well as development of new risk based climate services.

AB  - The status and movements of barbel Barbus barbus was assessed in a by-passed section of the former course of the Lower River Lee (England), which is amongst the most densely populated river catchments in England. Barbel abundance data from historical fisheries surveys and data on the movements of eleven tagged barbel between this section and the adjacent navigable channel using acoustic telemetry between November 2005 and November 2006 were examined. A popular area for anglers, the study stretch suffered a release of pollution (of unknown origin or type) in April 2006, approximately half way through the study. Contrary to unconfirmed reports of mass mortalities, the number of dead fish observed by the Environment Agency was low and none of the tagged fish died during or after the pollution incident. The historical survey data revealed a progressive decline in barbel abundance from the 1970s, through the 1990s, and up to 2009, suggesting that the pollution incident of April 2006 served to exacerbate an on-going, progressive decline in the species' abundance in this sector of the Old River Lee. The tagged barbel demonstrated great fidelity to one part of the study stretch, covered by a single acoustic receiver, including during the pollution event for some tagged barbel. This reluctance of barbel to leave their home area, even under altered conditions, suggests that this stretch of the River Lee satisfies all day-to-day requirements of the fish and provides refuge, at least for some fish, during adverse conditions.

AB  - The relative abundance of diatom species in different habitats can be used as a tool to infer prior environmental conditions and evaluate management decisions that influence habitat quality. Diatom distribution patterns were examined to characterize relationships between assemblage composition and environmental gradients in a subtropical estuarine watershed. We identified environmental correlates of diatom distribution patterns across the Charlotte Harbor, Florida, watershed; evaluated differences among three major river drainages; and determined how accurately local environmental conditions can be predicted using inference models based on diatom assemblages. Sampling locations ranged from freshwater to marine (0.1-37.2 ppt salinity) and spanned broad nutrient concentration gradients. Salinity was the predominant driver of difference among diatom assemblages across the watershed, but other environmental variables had stronger correlations with assemblages within the subregions of the three rivers and harbor. Eighteen indicator taxa were significantly affiliated with subregions. Relationships between diatom taxon distributions and salinity, distance from the harbor, total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) were evaluated to determine the utility of diatom assemblages to predict environmental values using a weighted averaging-regression approach. Diatom-based inferences of these variables were strong (salinity R (2) = 0.96; distance R (2) = 0.93; TN R (2) = 0.83; TP R (2) = 0.83). Diatom assemblages provide reliable estimates of environmental parameters on different spatial scales across the watershed. Because many coastal diatom taxa are ubiquitous, the diatom training sets provided here should enable diatom-based environmental reconstructions in subtropical estuaries that are being rapidly altered by land and water use changes and sea level rise.

AB  - Epiphytic bryophytes and lichens are an important component of the endangered forest biota in temperate forests, their diversity and composition patterns being regulated by tree, stand and landscape scale factors. The aim of this study is to improve ecological understanding of such factors in managed coniferous-deciduous mixed forests of Hungary in the context of forest management. In particular, this study investigate the effect of tree species composition, stand structure (tree size distribution, shrub layer and dead wood), microclimate (light, temperature and air humidity), landscape and historical factors on the stand level and tree level composition of epiphytic bryophytes and lichens. The relationships were explored by multivariate methods (redundancy analysis, canonical correspondence analysis and variation partitioning) and indicator species analysis. Tree species is among the most important driver of species composition in both organism groups. For bryophytes, the continuity of forest microclimate and the presence of shrub layer are also important, while lichen assemblages are influenced by light availability. Landscape and historical variables were less influential than stand scale factors. On the basis of our results, the main strategy of management focusing on epiphyte diversity conservation should include: (1) the maintenance of tree species diversity in mixed stands; (2) increasing the proportion of deciduous trees (mainly oaks and hornbeam); (3) the maintenance of large trees within the stands; (4) the presence of shrub and regeneration layer; (5) the creation of heterogeneous light conditions.

AB  - Introduction: Noise is increasingly recognised as a potentially important environmental pollutant but most studies on human responses to noise exposure relate to steady state situations. Effects may differ when noise changes rapidly, e.g. after noise mitigation interventions or with changes in road or airport configurations.
   Methods: A systematic review of studies on human reactions to changes in environmental noise exposures published from 1980 to March 2011 was conducted.
   Results: 41 papers satisfied the inclusion criteria. The most commonly studied outcomes were annoyance (23 papers) and sleep disturbance (11 papers). Other reactions were well-being, activity disturbance and use of living environment. No studies including physiological or disease measures were identified. The most commonly used study design was a written survey. Studies were methodologically diverse and it was not possible to conduct a formal meta-analysis. Annoyance was not necessarily decreased by reducing noise exposure. Non-acoustical factors influenced annoyance ratings and some of these were not identical to those in steady state conditions. There was insufficient evidence to recommend sleep disturbance as an alternative measure of reactions in changed noise conditions.
   Conclusions: Surveys of health effects in changed noise situations should be conducted both before and after the change. Annoyance as a reaction indicator should be evaluated with caution as non-acoustical factors play an important role in annoyance ratings. Technical interventions reducing noise levels may therefore not have impacts on annoyance proportionate to their impacts on sound levels. Further studies, investigating impacts on health endpoints (e.g. blood pressure) in changed noise situations are needed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The main objective of the present quasi-experimental study was to examine the influence of culture (Swedish vs Japanese) and environmental attitude (urban vs open-air person) on participants' thermal, emotional and perceptual assessments of a square, within the PET (physiological equivalent temperature) comfortable interval of 18-23 degrees C. It was predicted that persons living in different cultures with different environmental attitudes would psychologically evaluate a square differently despite similar thermal conditions. Consistent with this prediction, Japanese participants estimated the current weather as warmer than did Swedish participants and, consistent with this, they felt less thermally comfortable on the site, although participants in both countries perceived similar comfortable thermal outdoor conditions according to the PET index. Compared to the Japanese, the Swedes estimated both the current weather and the site as windier and colder, indicating a consistency in weather assessment on calm-windy and warm-cold scales in participants in both cultures. Furthermore, Swedish participants felt more glad and calm on the site and, in line with their character (more glad than gloomy), they estimated the square as more beautiful and pleasant than did Japanese participants. All this indicates that thermal, emotional and perceptual assessments of a physical place may be intertwined with psychological schema-based and socio-cultural processes, rather than fixed by general thermal indices developed in line with physiological heat balance models. In consequence, this implies that thermal comfort indices may not be applicable in different cultural/climate zones without modifications, and that they may not be appropriate if we do not take into account the psychological processes involved in environmental assessment.

AB  - Lake chemistry is influenced by land use in the surrounding watershed, particularly in complex urban landscapes, which are commonly subjected to an increase in material loadings. Because land use is rarely uniform, individual ecosystems embedded within the landscape may reflect varying water quality conditions. The Lake Merced system is composed of three lake basins with watersheds (surface area = 13 km(2)) residing entirely within the city of San Francisco, California. On nine occasions from January-June 1995 we sampled the two main lakes (North and South Lake Merced) within the system to evaluate their relative productivity and nutrient status. On each date, several physical-chemical conditions were measured, and nutrient enrichment bioassays were performed to evaluate the nutritional status of the phytoplankton (nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) enrichment in a 2 x 2 factorial experimental design). All the parameters tested except temperature were higher in the north lake compared with the south (pair-wise Wilcoxon Ranked sums), and common trophic state variables were more than 2-fold higher in the north lake. Phytoplankton growth in North Lake Merced was N-limited while growth in South Lake Merced was co-limited by N and P. In sum, our data indicate that differences among these lakes may be explained by simple volume differences between lakes (with the smaller North Lake Merced being more eutrophic), and heavy stocking of fishes to the north lake. Particulate nutrient ratios (N:P) were good indicators of phytoplankton nutritional status throughout the system, while N:P ratios based on total nutrient concentrations gave misleading results.

AB  - Intensity of growth and ability to utilize feeds were studied in ten different strains of carp fry of the generation F1 of domestic and imported parental carps.  The trials were performed in comparable experimental conditions eliminating the presence of natural food.  The carp fry was tested for the production effect of feedstuffs of different protein contents (12; 24; 34 %).  Two feed mixtures were used (S1 and S3) and wheat as a control feed.
   In the tested strains of carp fry, different demand for proportion of protein in the feed was manifested by differentiated intensity of the growth, feed conversion and protein utilization for increment.  By comparatively highest growth intensity and the best feed conversion were distinguished the populations of hybrid scaly strains of carp fry marked C 591, C 626, C 667 and C 700.  The carp fry of the strains C 623 and C 700 manifested also comparatively higher ability to utilize the cereal feed ration.  Of the used feeds, a mixture with higher proportion of protein (S3) stimulated the indicators under study, under the given conditions of the trial.  A higher daily increment was recorded on an average by 24 % in application of the mixture S3 in comparison with the mixture S1, and the specific growth rate was higher by 29.5 %; the feed consumption was lower by 5.8 % and the PER values were higher by 6.6 % than in the application of the mixture S1.  The knowledge obtained was used in the breeding programmes studying the introduction of re-bred strains of fry carp marked by high performance and resistance into the breeding practice.

AB  - Inadequate usage can degrade natural resources, particularly soils. More attention has been paid to practices aiming at the recovery of degraded soils in the last years, e.g, the use of organic fertilizers, liming and introduction of species adapted to adverse conditions. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate the recovery of physical properties of a Red Latosol (Oxisol) degraded by the construction of a hydroelectric power station. In the study area, a soil layer about Sin thick had been withdrawn by heavy machines leading not only to soil compaction, but resulting in high-degree degradation. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design with nine treatments and four replications. The treatments consisted of: 1- soil mobilization by tilling (to ensure the effect of mechanical mobilization in all treatments) without planting, but growth of spontaneous vegetation; 2- Black velvet bean (Stizolobium aterrimum Piper & Tracy); 3- Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L.) DC); 4- Liming + black velvet bean; 5- Liming + pigeonpea until 1994, when replaced by jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis); 6- Liming + gypsum + black velvet bean; 7- Liming + gypsum + pigeonpea until 1994, when replaced by jack bean; and two controls as reference: 8- Native Cerrado vegetation and 9- bare soil (no tilling and no planting), left under natural conditions and in this situation, without spontaneous vegetation. In treatments 1 through 7, the soil was tilled. Treatments were installed in 1992 and left unmanaged for seven years, until brachiaria (Brachiaria decumbens) was planted in all plots in 1999. Seventeen years after implantation, the properties soil macroporosity, microporosity, total porosity, bulk density and aggregate stability were assessed in the previously described treatments in the soil layers 0.00-0.10; 0.10-0.20 and 0.20-0.40 m, and soil Penetration Resistance and soil moisture in 0.00-0.15 and 0.15-0.30 m. The plants were evaluated for: bruchiaria dry matter and spontaneous growth of native tree species in the plots as of 2006. Results were analyzed by variance analysis and Tukey's test at 5 % for mean comparison. In all treatments, except for the bare soil (no recovery measures), ongoing recovery of the degraded soil physical properties was observed. Macroporosity, soil bulk density and total porosity were good soil quality indicators. The occurrence of spontaneous native species indicated the soil recovery process. The best adapted species was Machaerium acutifolium Vogel, with the largest number of plants and most advanced development; the dry matter production of B. decumbens in recovering soil was similar to normal conditions, evidencing soil recovery.

AB  - The 300 m section of the Miocene Monterey Formation outcropping at Shell Beach (Pismo basin; ca. 15-11 Ma) is composed of calcareous phosphatic (15.1-14.5 Ma) and siliceous facies (14.5-11.0 Ma). An objective of this paper is to document lateral paleoenvironmental changes in the Miocene Monterey Formation by comparing the Shell Beach (SE) profile with the Naples Beach (NB) section in the Santa Barbara-Ventura basin (Schouten et al.. 1997) which is similar to 80 km to the south. Eight samples (one sample representing, on average, a time period of ca. 2000 y) from this section were analyzed for variations of extractable biomarkers and their carbon isotopic signatures as indicators for paleoenvironmental change during the Miocene. Saturated hydrocarbons present include 28,30-dinorhopane, phytane, n-alkanes (C-17-C-31), lycopane, and 17 beta,21 beta(H)-homohopane. The biomarkers released after desulfurization of the polar fractions predominantly consist of phytane, 2,6,10,14-tetramethyl-7-(3-methylpen tyl)pentadecane, C-17-C-31 n-alkanes, regular 5 alpha- and 5 beta-steranes, dinosteranes, and (22R)-17 beta,21 beta(H)-pentakishomohopane. Steranes have similar carbon isotopic compositions (-25 to -27 parts per thousand) throughout the section and are isotopically similar at both sites, indicating laterally similar and vertically stable environmental conditions for algae living in the upper part of the photic zone. Free and S-bound n-alkanes at SE mainly originate from marine organisms and not from terrestrial sources as in the NE section. S-bound pentakishomohopane is ca. 1-4 parts per thousand depleted compared to the steranes and is thought to be derived from the deeper water dwelling cyanobacteria. These findings are consistent with stable carbon isotopic data obtained for these compounds From Middle Miocene Monterey sediments at Naples Beach and indicates similar environmental conditions in the depositional environments of the Santa Barbara-Ventura and the Pismo basin. S-bound highly branched isoprenoids have, at both sites, different isotopic compositions indicating the presence of different diatom species, special growth conditions, or different bloom periods in the Pismo basin. The carbon isotopic composition of 28,30-dinorhopane shifts to more depleted values up section, suggesting that the dinorhopane-synthesizing organism or organisms live on CO2, which is isotopically influenced by methane production and oxidation. The C-31 hopane is enriched by 1-4 parts per thousand in C-13 compared to other hopanes and steranes. Specific bacteria, possibly heterotrophs, may have been the organisms producing this compound.

AB  - Recently, dynamic cool roof (DCR), with the ability to reduce its solar reflectance during heating period, is introduced as a proper replacement for traditional cool roof. Another ideal roof solution is green roof (GR), which can reduce both heating and cooling loads of a building. This study aims to compare air-conditioning energy demands of a residential building with DCRs and GRs, based on numerical analysis with EnergyPlus. Different climatic conditions, thermal mass and insulation levels were considered in the simulation. Also, in order to assure the validity of the results, optimal properties for GRs and the best strategy for switching coatings of DCRs were found before the comparison analysis. The results show that for hot and humid climate, GRs with regular irrigation system are the best roof technique, which can reduce annual thermal loads of the reference building with conventional concrete roof by 17.8-171.4 kWh/m2 (21.3-66.0%), depending on thermal mass and insulation levels. In hot summer-cold winter city, DCRs outperform both dry and wet GRs with the potential to decrease annual energy demand by 11.8-66.7 kWh/m2 (22.4-35.4%). While in area where space heating dominates, dry GRs have the best energy performance, as they can save annual energy of the reference building by 5.5-124.0 kWh/m2 (6.9-44.1%). Applying these optimal roof techniques can reduce annual CO2 emissions of the reference building by up to 20.2-34.5 kg/m2 (38.3-56.6%), depending on the region.

AB  - Measurements of cilia function (beat frequency, pattern) have been established as diagnostic tools for respiratory diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia. However, the wider application of these techniques is limited by the extreme susceptibility of ciliary function to changes in environmental factors e.g., temperature, humidity, and pH. In the airway of patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), mucus accumulation impedes cilia beating. Cilia function has been investigated in primary airway cell models as an indicator of CF Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) channel activity. However, considerable patient-to-patient variability in cilia beating frequency has been found in response to CFTR-modulating drugs, even for patients with the same CFTR mutations. Furthermore, the impact of dysfunctional CFTR-regulated chloride secretion on ciliary function is poorly understood. There is currently no comprehensive protocol demonstrating sample preparation of in vitro airway models, image acquisition, and analysis of Cilia Beat Frequency (CBF). Standardized culture conditions and image acquisition performed in an environmentally controlled condition would enable consistent, reproducible quantification of CBF between individuals and in response to CFTR-modulating drugs. This protocol describes the quantification of CBF in three different airway epithelial cell model systems: 1) native epithelial sheets, 2) air-liquid interface models imaged on permeable support inserts, and 3) extracellular matrix-embedded three-dimensional organoids. The latter two replicate in vivo lung physiology, with beating cilia and production of mucus. The ciliary function is captured using a high-speed video camera in an environment-controlled chamber. Custom-built scripts are used for the analysis of CBF. Translation of CBF measurements to theclinic is envisioned to be an important clinical tool for predicting response to CFTRmodulating drugs on a per-patient basis.

AB  - The freeze-thaw changes of seasonally frozen ground (SFG) are an important indicator of climate change. Based on observed daily freeze depth of SFG from meteorological stations on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 1960 to 2014, the spatial-temporal characteristics and trends in SFG were analyzed, and the relationships between them and climatic and geographical factors were explored. Freeze-thaw changes of SFG on a regional scale were assessed by multiple regression functions. Results showed multiyear mean maximum freeze depth, freeze-thaw duration, freeze start date, and thaw end date that demonstrate obvious distribution characteristics of climatic zones. A decreasing trend in maximum freeze depth and freeze-thaw duration occurred on the TP from 1960 to 2014. The freeze start date has been later, and the thaw end date has been significantly earlier. The freeze-thaw changes of SFG significantly affected by soil hydrothermal conditions on the TP could be assessed by elevation and latitude or by air temperature and precipitation, due to their high correlations. The regional average of maximumfreeze depth and freeze-thaw duration caused by climatic and geographical factors were larger than those averaged using meteorological station data because most stations are located at lower altitudes. Maximum freeze depth and freeze-thaw duration have decreased sharply since 2000 on the entire TP. Warming and wetting conditions of the soil resulted in a significant decrease in maximum freeze depth and freeze-thaw duration in the most area of the TP, while drying soil results in a slight increase of them in the southeast of the TP.

AB  - Imaging modalities play a major role in early detection and diagnosis of various medical conditions related to the patient. Retinal image segmentation has been taken up for investigation in this research paper to efficiently detect the presence of eye disorder which could be indicators of major onset of conditions like hypertension, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular disorders, etc. A machine learning method for classification of given pixels in the search space into regions containing blood vessels and those that do not contain blood vessels is implemented using a three-stage neural classifier in this paper. Prior to classification, an optimization algorithm namely ant colony optimization derived from nature-inspired phenomena is used to provide an optimal feature vector set to set high standards for the neural network based classification approach. The novelty and merits of the paper lie in back tracing of the segmentation process in which optimization is done first on the preprocessed features followed by classification for segmented output on the optimized features. This results in elimination of redundant feature vectors which tend to occupy much memory as well increase the computational overhead on the process. The entire implemented system is automated by the machine learning process and tested on 30 samples, 15 each on DRIVE and STARE databases. Classification rates of nearly 98% on an average scenario have been achieved for segmentation and 96.5% for abnormality detection. The performances have been compared against Bayesian set models and standalone ANN models.

AB  - Spruce stands in the mountains of Central Europe are particularly valuable, not only because of their natural and scenic values but also because of their role in the protection of watersheds and soil. Over the past decades, these stands were frequently exposed to massive deforestation caused by various biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic factors. The current health condition of spruce stands in the Eastern Sudetes shows that the next phase of deterioration of these stands has begun. Bearing in mind past experiences and the current situation in these mountain areas, it is particularly important to understand the processes and factors that may short-term (2012-2016) spruce health analyses based on the normalized difference red-edge index and RapidEye satellite imagery, which is being delivered annually. Aided by remote sensing data and Boosted Regression Trees, it was possible to determine the topographic and tree stand features having the greatest impact on the vitality of spruce in all analyzed areas during 2012-2016. As the results show, the highest impact on the value of the normalized difference red-edge index indicator comes from a height above sea level, age of stands, terrain slopes, and exposure. In various areas, these factors may affect the vitality of spruce to varying degrees but not always in the same way. Our models accurately explained 74-81% of the randomly selected input data (predicted 72-80% of the excluded data) for site A, 50-58% for site B (48-57% for tested data) and 54-70% for site C (52-69% for excluded data).

AB  - Understanding how individuals, communities, and populations vary in their vulnerability requires defining and identifying vulnerability with respect to a condition, and then developing robust methods to reliably measure vulnerability. In this study, we illustrate how a conceptual model translated via simulation can guide the real-world implementation of data collection and measurement of a model system. We present a generalizable statistical framework that specifies linkages among interacting social and biophysical components in complex landscapes to examine vulnerability. We use the simulated data to present a case study in which households are vulnerable to conditions of land function, which we define as the provision of goods and services from the surrounding environment. We use an example of a transboundary region of Southern Africa and apply a set of hypothesized, simulated data to illustrate how one might use the framework to assess vulnerability based on empirical data. We define vulnerability as the predisposition of being adversely affected by environmental variation and its impacts on land uses and their outcomes as exposure (E), mediated by sensitivity (S), and mitigated by adaptive capacity (AC). We argue that these are latent, or hidden, characteristics that can be measured through a set of observable indicators. Those indicators and the linkages between latent variables require model specification prior to data collection, critical for applying the type of modeling framework presented. We discuss the strength and directional pathways between land function and vulnerability components, and assess their implications for identifying potential leverage points within the system for the benefit of future policy and management decisions.

AB  - Migration phenology plays a critical role in shaping bird life histories. While the spring migration phenology of birds has been widely studied, our understanding about the mechanisms underlying autumn migration is limited. Frost is an indicator of cold weather, food scarcity, and water unavailability, but how frost drives the autumn departure of migratory birds has not yet been quantified. In this study we propose the 'frost wave hypothesis', which posits that the autumn departure of waterfowl is driven by a successive wave of the onset of frost. Using bird satellite tracking data and generalized linear mixed models, we analyze how the departure probability of two waterfowl species during autumn migration is affected by frost, accumulated temperature, food, snow, ice, short-term weather conditions (i.e., wind, temperature and precipitation), remaining migration distances, relative stopover duration, and flight distances between stopover sites. We find that bird autumn departure probability sharply increases after the first frost spell when the accumulated temperature reaches 0 degrees C, facilitated by surface meridional wind and longer remaining migration distances. We underline the dominant effect of frost on autumn departure, as birds tend to leave even under head wind if the time lag since the onset of frost is large. Time constraints that trigger southward departure are likely to be stronger when migrating birds are still far from their wintering site. By riding the frost wave, birds manage to maximize stopover site utilization while escaping harsh environmental conditions. Our findings improve the understanding of annual avian migration and help quantify the impact of global climate change on migratory waterfowl.

AB  - The Mississippi coastal region has two major rivers and four smaller rivers influencing the estuaries that make up the Mississippi Sound. The islands off Mississippi create a barrier which allows the area to be a widespread, productive estuarine region. With such a dependence on discharge from the drainages, it is important to understand the effect of salinity regimes on fish communities. Drought conditions in other regions have been shown to dramatically change the fish community structure. We used the long running Interjurisdictional Fisheries Program database (2006-2014) within Mississippi state waters and compared yearly fish communities between drought and non-drought years. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (nMDS), Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM), and Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) were used to compare drought and non-drought conditions in the Mississippi Sound. During 2006 and 2007, which were identified as drought years by the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), differences in fish community structure were identified and compared to non-drought years (2008-2009 and 2011-2014). The ISA identified a total of eight species that were significantly influenced by drought years. Of the eight species, the abundance of seven species significantly decreased while the abundance of one species significantly increased. With an increasing human population in central and south Mississippi, pressure on freshwater resources is likely to increase, resulting in possible changes in the fish community dynamics of the Mississippi Sound. Understanding the influence of decreased river discharges will assist managers in determining the impacts of freshwater withdrawals during base flow periods.

AB  - Recovery of an ecosystem from drought is an important indicator of ecosystem resilience. However, few investigations have heretofore focused on the recovery of ecosystem carbon and energy fluxes but have mainly focused on the drought recovery of plant growth and ecosystem productions. Therefore, the present study uses in situ observations from FLUXNET 2015 to examine the recovery of carbon flux and energy flux of ecosystems from the 2003 European drought and the 2012 U.S. drought on the daily scale. The results reveal the strong impact of these two extreme droughts on ecosystem gross primary production, total ecosystem respiration, net ecosystem exchange, and latent heat flux. In addition, the recovery time of these indicators differ significantly. At the regional scale, the recovery of gross primary production, total ecosystem respiration, net ecosystem exchange, and latent heat flux took 44, 23, 63, and 27 days after the 2003 European drought, and the recovery for corresponding indicators for the 2012 U.S. drought took 42, 63, 15, and 33 days, respectively. Further investigations suggest that indicator background conditions and drought-damage magnitudes played an important role in regulating drought recovery in the 2003 European drought, with lower background value and greater damage leading to a longer recovery time. The ecosystem recovery from the 2012 U.S. drought, however, was dominated by the precipitation condition during the recovery period, with more precipitation associated with a shorter recovery time. These results provide crucial insight into the divergent recovery trajectories for different carbon-water processes among diverse bioclimatic regions.

AB  - The middle catchment of the Nu River is highly susceptible to debris flows. Differences in flow and substratum conditions among mainstem reaches correlate with debris flow depositions from lateral tributaries. We studied the impacts of debris flows on macroinvertebrates, especially responses in their diversity and assemblage structure to habitat modification at 22 sites in three habitats: barrier lakes and debris dams, formed by debris flow deposits barring the river, and unaffected mainstem sections. Unaffected mainstem sites supported the most diverse macroinvertebrate assemblage, with mean taxon richness, density and biomass 1.4, 1.1, and 23.6 times higher than those of debris dam sites, and 2.1, 4.2, and 7.4 times higher than those of barrier lake sites, respectively. Variance analysis revealed significant differences in diversity indices, and both taxonomic and functional feeding group composition among habitats. Although barrier lakes and debris dams had lower taxon richness, the two affected habitats contributed 17 and 16 exclusive taxa, respectively, to total taxon richness. Redundancy analysis identified habitats could be characterized by water temperature, electrical conductivity, flow velocity, and median particle size of substratum type. Significant differences in flow velocity and substratum median particle size among habitats were attributed to debris flows. Distinct assemblages within barrier lakes were associated with fine sediments. By altering habitat conditions, debris flows affect macroinvertebrate assemblages, reducing diversity locally in affected reaches, contributing to variation in diversity and assemblage structure throughout the catchment. Three genera (Cricotopus sp., Pseudocloeon sp. and Monodiamesa sp.) are proposed as potential indicator taxa for unaffected mainstem, debris dam and barrier lake habitats, respectively.

AB  - Understanding the decisions that animals make in the presence of predation risk can reveal their assessment of current and future reproductive options. The wolf spider, Pardosa milvina, has a conspicuous courtship display that is an indicator of male quality. In an initial experiment, we determined that male courtship was highly repeatable and correlated with symmetry. We then used symmetry as an indicator of quality to explore the reactions of males when presented with simulated predation risk and an attractive virgin female. There were no differences in courtship features between risk and no risk treatments unless we took into account male quality. High-quality males reduced courtship intensity under risk conditions suggesting that they estimated their long-term fitness prospects as strong. This response is consistent with the asset protection principle, which suggests that animals with high value traits should behave cautiously. Low-quality males courted at high levels under predation risk, which seemed to be reckless attempts to attract females. This response is analogous to the "desperado effect," which is one explanation for vigorous fighting by inferior animals in contests. Although females used behavior to select males when no predator information was present, they seemed to use symmetry in the presence of predator cues. The ability of females to select the most attractive males suggests that they can accurately assess male quality under laboratory conditions. High courting "desperado" males may occasionally be selected in more complex environments and/or when they are in competition with other males.

AB  - The ostracod faunas of six middle to late Eocene sections in the Central Sakarya Region were studied with the aim to describe the palaeoenvironmental changes occurred in the area and the age of the Halidiye Formation.
   This study based on the Ostracoda fauna was carried out for the first time in the region and a comparison between the Ostracoda species identified in this study and the data obtained by other previous work carried out in central Europe and Turkey indicated a middle to late Eocene age for the formation.
   Within the Halidiye Formation, 35 species of Ostracoda belonging to 31 genera were observed, among which, the followings are the more relevant for chronostratigraphic purposes: Cytherella jonesiana (Bosquet), Bairdia cymbula Deltel, B. crebra Deltel, Neocyprideis williamsoniana (Bosquet), Cuneocythere (Monsmirabilia) triebeli (Keij), Schuleridea perforata (Roemer), Hemicyprideis montosa (Jones ve Sherborn), Cladarocythere apostolescui (Margerie), Krithe parvula Deltel, K. angusta Deltel, K. caudata Van Den Bold, K. rutoti Keij, Trachyleberis aculeata modesta Van Hinte, Pterygocythereis aquitanica Ducasse, Nucleolina multicostata (Deltel), Leguminocythereis genappensis Keij, Grinioneis alata Ducasse, G. paijenborchiana Keij, Quadracythere persica Tambareau, Caudites orientalis Sonmez-Gokcen, Loxoconcha subovata (Muenster), Monoceratina striata Deltel, Uroleberis globosa Ducasse, Paracypris contracta (Jones), Cyprinotus sp., and Heterocypris sp.
   Based on the lithological properties and environmental indicators, the Halidiye Formation reflects characteristics of transitional lagoonal to deep marine settings. Among the Ostracoda identified hereby, Cyprinotus and Heterocypris indicate freshwater, Cladarocythere, Neocyprideis, and Loxoconcha indicate lagoonal, Leptocythere, Cytheromorpha, and Cyamocytheridea indicate lagoonallittoral, Hermanites, Quadracythere, and Uroleberis indicate epineritic, Monsmirabilia, Schuleridea, and Caudites indicate epineritic-infraneritic, Paracypris indicates infraneritic, Cytherella, Bairdia, and Cytheropteron indicate epineritic-bathyal, and, finally, Krithe and Macrocypris indicate infraneritic-bathyal environmental conditions.

AB  - Dormancy is a state of reduced metabolic activity adopted by organisms during periods of environmental stress, including physiological and biochemical adaptations. In this study, the physiological and immunological statuses of two populations of Isostichopus badionotus with different times of dormancy (B12 = 12 months and B24 = 24 months) are compared with a physiologically active population (BC = control). The coelomic liquid (CL) of 18 organisms from each batch (B24, B12, and BC) was used to perform the biochemical analysis. The body volume of dormant L badionotus decreased exponentially as time passed under stable conditions. The total protein of B24 (9.26 mg/ml) was lower than that of B12 (15.64 mg/ml) and BC (13.21 mg/ml). Carbohydrate content was similar in both groups (824 and B12) of dormant I. badionotus but lower than that of the control (6.93 mg/ml). The cholesterol content of B12 (0.40 mg/ml) was significantly higher than the similar cholesterol levels of B24 and the control. Activities of superoxide dismutase CT-SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were higher in B12 than in B24 and BC. Phenoloxidase was lower in dormant sea cucumbers than the control (37.3 U/ml). Dormancy for the B12 organisms appears to be a fairly light state, involving no physiological changes that cannot be rapidly reversed. In contrast, the B24 organisms showed deterioration of their antioxidant complex and low lipid and protein reserves after 48 months, suggesting that the return to an active state would be impossible.

AB  - This paper presents new petrologic data for high-pressure, low-temperature (HP-LT) metamorphic rocks at Juisui. We reinterpret the so-called "Tamayen block" (Yang and Wang, 1985) or "Juisui block" (Liou, 1981; Beyssac et al., 2008) as a tectonic melange. It is not a coherent sheet but rather a mixture dominated by greenschist and pelitic schist with pods of serpentinite, epidote amphibolite, and rare blueschist. Four types of glaucophane-bearing rocks are newly recognized in this melange. Type I is in contact with greenschist lacking glaucophane and garnet. Glaucophane is present only as rare inclusions within pargasite. This type records metamorphic evolution from epidote blueschists-, epidote amphibolite-, to greenschist-facies. Type II contains characteristic zoned amphiboles from barroisite core to Mg-katophorite mantle and glaucophane rim, implying an epidote amphibolite-facies stage overprinted by an epidote blueschists-facies one. Type III includes winchite and indicates P-T conditions of about 6-8 kbar, approaching 400 degrees C. Type IV contains paragonite but lacks garnet; amphibole shows a Na-Ca core surrounded by a glaucophane rim. This type shows a high-pressure (?) epidote amphibolite-facies stage overririnted by an epidote blueschists-facies one. Amphibole zoning trends and mineral assemblages imply contradictory P-T paths for the four types of glaucophane-bearing rocks consistent with the nature of a tectonic m lange. The new P-T constraints and petrologic findings differ from previous studies (Liou et al., 1975; Beyssac et al., 2008). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the Arctic, temperature is a major environmental factor controlling the occurrence, abundance and distribution of plants at regional and local scales alike. This means that statistical models of temperature distribution can predict the distribution of plant species or communities. Conversely, certain plant taxa make good bio-indicators reflecting long-term thermal conditions in a given habitat. Both these assumptions were taken into account when modelling the spatial relationship between plants and temperature. This work continues a previous preliminary 1 yr study based on correlations between a plant-based index of thermophily (I-t) and different synthetic temperature distribution characteristics. To strengthen confidence in the results and conclusions, more temperature data were collected through a field campaign conducted over a further 5 yr period (2001 to 2005). The goals here were (1) to establish an accurate interpolation model capable of restoring, at local scale, the continuous summertime thermal raster surface, (2) to evaluate the capacity of the temperature values obtained from the model to predict the distribution of I-t, and (3) to extrapolate temperature surfaces from this I-t. The results show that the mutual predictive power between temperature and I-t is satisfactory and that the model can be applied to neighbouring areas, although the present study area is too small to define the geographical limits of extrapolation. This predictive power declines where local landscape structures are heterogeneous. Correlations between I-t and growing degree day (GDD) values derived from the modelled temperature layers were systematically analysed in order to identify conditions in which this covariation works or fails.

AB  - Microfacies and biomarker analyses are used to determine the environmental conditions during deposition of marly dolomicrites from the Hauptdolomite Wiestalstausee section near Hallein (Salzburg, Austria), part of the Late Triassic Hauptdolomite/Dachstein carbonate platform of the Northern Calcareous Alps. Phytoplankton and photosynthetic bacteria are considered to be the major primary producers of the organic matter in these immature (similar to 0.5% equivalent vitrinite reflectance), carbonate-rich rocks. Contributions from vascular plants are suggested from the n-alkane distribution pattern and high content Of C-29 steranes. Enhanced microbial activity in the depositional environment is proposed on the basis of the hopanoid content. The occurrence of aryl isoprenoids, probably derived from carotenoids of the photosynthetic green sulfur bacteria (Chlorobiaceae) indicates the presence of free H2S in the bottom water. Mesohaline conditions in the upper part of the water column are deduced from the presence of dimethylated and trimethylated 2-methyl-2-(tridecylchromans) (MTTCs). Co-variation in the distribution of MTTCs and pristane/phytane ratio and the concentration of a C-16 aryl isoprenoid argue for photic zone anoxia due to salinity stratification. The biomarker composition points to a high productivity marine environment with limited water exchange and a stratified water column confirmed by microfacies analysis. A small scale basin formed within the restricted inner lagoonal area of the Hauptdolomite/Dachstein carbonate platform through erosion by currents, followed by a sea level rise is considered the most appropriate depositional environment of the dolomicrites of the Wiestalstausee section.

AB  - In the south of the State of Santa Catarina lies the Camacho Lagoon (28 degrees 36'S and 048 degrees 54'W), which is connected to the Atlantic Ocean by a single channel known as the Camacho Inlet. The inlet is not permanently open, which impedes fishing activity inside the lagoon. The State Government therefore decided to build two groins at the mouth of the inlet, with the aim of stabilizing it. However, even with the groins in place, the lagoon still shows an inconsistent profile. This research seeks to analyze the stability of the inlet, the factors at work, and the efficiency of the groins. This study of the stability of Camacho Inlet involved empirical criteria based on (1) the relationship between tidal prism and Cross-section area; (2) the relationship between maximum velocity and cross-section area and (3) the relationship between response ability and cross-section area. Taking into account the environmental aspects of the area and its fluctuations, it is clear that the efforts to keep the Camacho Inlet open were in vain. The Camacho Inlet presents a strong profile of instability, with cross-section area and flow velocity values below those necessary to generate stable conditions in the system. The channel is only open during periods of intense river discharge and/or meteorological tides; once the inlet is open, the flow is maintained by the semidiurnal tide, which is not strong enough to remove the sediment deposited in the channel. This condition, associated with the high rate of sediment transport in the region, causes the channel to close completely.

AB  - The trace fossil Asteriacites, recorded in Cambrian to Recent shallow- and deep-marine facies, is traditionally interpreted as the resting trace of asterozoans. Well-preserved specimens of A. lumbricalis are abundant in Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous) shallow- and marginal-marine siliciclastic deposits of eastern Kansas and western Missouri. Detailed morphologic analysis of these specimens suggests that they record the activities of mobile epifaunal ophiuroids. Evidence of a brittle star (ophiuroid) producer rather than sea star (asteroid) is provided by (1) trace-fossil morphologic features reflecting the anatomy of the producer (e.g., well-differentiated central structure, slender vermiform arms) and ophiuroid burrowing technique (e.g., proximal arm expansion, arm branching), and (2) mode of occurrence (e.g., gregarious behavior, horizontal and vertical repetition). Vertical and horizontal repetition produces complex aggregates of A. lumbricalis that are interpreted either as escape structures (fugichnia) or as feeding structures, respectively. Ophiura texturata is proposed as a modem analogue for the A. lumbricalis producer, based on inferred life habit and feeding behavior. Asteriacites lumbricalis is present in two different intertidal trace-fossil assemblages. The first assemblage is characterized by high diversity and records tidal flats developed outside of embayments under normal marine conditions. The second assemblage consists of A. lumbricalis together with a few other ichnotaxa and represents a depauperate association that developed in restricted tidal flats within an embayment or estuarine setting. This challenges the conventional view of Asteriacites as a normal-marine salinity indicator. Some echinoderms, and particularly asterozoans, penetrate and inhabit modern environments of depressed salinity. The presence of Asteriacites in Pennsylvanian marginal-marine facies of Kansas and Missouri provides evidence that ophiuroids had adapted to brackish-water conditions by the late Paleozoic.

AB  - Both surface and subsoil layers can be a significant source of soil moisture and nutrients for crop growth, but the changes in subsoil properties due to management are rarely assessed. This study was conducted to determine tillage and residue management effects on soil nutrient availability, as well as soil biological and physical conditions throughout soil layers ranging from 0 to 60 cm. We utilized an experiment with 40-year long continuous maize (Zea mays L.) cropping under crossed plow-till (PT) vs. no-till (NT) and residue removed (Hare) vs. residue returned (Ret) treatments on a silt loam soil in Chazy, NY. We assessed soil properties that are indicative of soil processes important for crop growth. Soil physical indicators (texture, bulk density (BD), water stable aggregation (WSA), available water capacity (AWC), and air-filled porosity (AFP)), soil biological indicators (soil organic matter (SOM), permanganate oxidizable carbon, mineralizable carbon, and soil protein), and soil chemical indicators (pH and plant available nutrients) were measured at five depth increments (0-6, 6-18, 18-30, 30-45, and 45- to 60-cm depth). A novel statistical approach of marginal R-2 (R(2)m) was used to show percent variance of each measured soil indicator explained by tillage and residue management as well as the depth of soil sample. R(2)m was higher for soil biological indicators (0.66 < R(2)m < 0.91), compared to AWC and those nutrients that are not applied through fertilizer application (0.11 < R(2)m < 0.53). NT-Ret showed the highest concentration of majority of the measured soil nutrients, and higher accumulation of SOM related properties across depths. This was partly explained by favorable soil physical conditions indicated by BD, WSA, and AFP at the transition layer (18- to 30-cm depth) that allowed for the vertical exchange of soil water, nutrients, and SOM related properties between the topsoil and the subsoil layers. The PT treatments showed the absence of SOM transfer across the transition layer, whereas NT-Hary showed nutrient depletion at the transition and subsoil layers. This study revealed significant alteration of soil biological, chemical, and physical indicators depending on the treatment combinations, which can be ignored if surface sampling is solely used. Benefits of residue return appear more significant when combined with no-till for 1) providing better soil physical conditions and 2) maintaining adequate nutrient availability across a soil profile especially when considering subsoil properties.

AB  - In pasture-based dairy production systems, dairy cows often receive a silage- and concentrate-based ration [total mixed ration (TMR)] during wintertime and are gradually introduced to fresh herbage in spring. The present study aimed to investigate how the transition to this new nutritional situation influenced different production and health indicators. A 10-wk trial was performed in spring 2014, including 60 dairy cows of the German Holstein breed (166 +/- 23 d in milk, 23.5 +/- 3.7 kg of milk/d; means +/- SD). The cows were divided into a pasture and a confinement group (PG and CG, respectively). The CG stayed on a TMR-based diet (35% corn silage, 35% grass silage, 30% concentrate; DM basis), whereas the PG was gradually transitioned from a TMR- to a pasture-based ration (wk 1 = TMR-only, wk 2 = 3 h/d on pasture, wk 3 and 4 = 12 h/d on pasture, wk 5-10 = pasture-only). A continuous grazing system was implemented on a ryegrass dominated pasture and temperature humidity indices were assessed based on continuous recording of temperature and humidity indoors as well as outdoors. Dry matter intake (DMI) from TMR, milk production, body weight (BW), and body condition score decreased as soon as the PG had partial access to pasture. Milk production and BW decreased even further in the first week on a full grazing ration, but thereafter BW increased again and milk production stabilized. The DMI estimation using the n-alkane method in wk 7 and 9 revealed an increase in DMI from pasture between the 2 time points and indicates an adaptation of grazing behavior and metabolism over several weeks. Increased serum beta-hydroxybutyrate and fatty acids concentrations at several time points, as well as a continuous body condition score decrease during the whole course of the trial, indicate an energy deficit in the PG. A significant correlation between serum glucose concentrations and the temperature humidity indices was observed. An increase in serum and milk urea concentrations as well as an increase in the urine total N to creatinine ratio occurred in the PG. To assess possible negative effects of the ration change on metabolic and liver health, different clinical chemistry variables and complete blood counts were assessed. No biologically relevant changes were observed for serum albumin, total protein, cholesterol, aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, and glutamate dehydrogenase concentrations, as well as for white and red blood cell counts.

AB  - We synthesized the current information on mesophytic cove forests in the southern Appalachians, assessed the range of variation in herb species composition and diversity in stands with different disturbance histories and environmental conditions, identified key knowledge gaps, and suggested approaches to fill these knowledge gaps. The purpose of this synthesis was to provide information to forest managers to help make decisions about conservation assessments and strategies for rich cove forests in the southern Appalachians. An important finding is that no single study or data set can provide conclusive evidence or clear management strategies. However, an overriding conclusion is that the magnitude of impact and the management actions necessary to restore herbaceous communities are directly proportional to the severity of disturbance, current condition (e. g., presence of Rhododendron), site heterogeneity, and historical land use (e.g., agricultural activity). These factors plus a host of other stressors (e.g., climate variability, air pollution, invasives) are likely to have a strong influence on the highly variable patterns observed when comparing herbaceous diversity of 'old-growth' or uncut forests to human disturbed forests (e. g., cutting, air pollution, conversion, invasive plants or insects). Results from this review reinforce our premise that factors controlling herbaceous species presence and abundance are highly complex, thus broad generalizations about the impacts of a single factor such as logging should be interpreted with caution. Of the stressors known to affect forest trees (e.g., pests and pathogens, acidic deposition, air pollution, drought, and wind), little to no information exists on how these same stressors will affect herbaceous plants. A limited number of studies have examined the demography or physiology of forest herbs, particularly across all life stages. While the demography of a few genera have been studied (e.g., Hexastylis, Asarum, Trillium, Arisaema, Goodyera, Hepatica), little to no information exists for the majority of woodland herbs. Species identity is important when considering management of rich cove forests. Diversity may increase following canopy disturbances that favor recruitment of early-seral herbaceous species; therefore, simple indices of diversity (H', S, and E) are not the best measure of recovery in mesophytic rich coves, particularly where shade-adapted 'rich-cove indicator' species have been replaced by these species. Species-specific life histories and the influence of prevailing site conditions are important lines of research for understanding recovery and sustainability of mesophytic rich cove forests.

AB  - Superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) absorb more water than their mass. When applied to frigid, semiarid soils, they may modify physical processes and amplify winter freezing-thawing effects for remediating compaction. If so, SAPs may be an effective amendment in reclamation projects. Laboratory tests evaluated SAPs influences on setting antecedent soil moisture and mechanical conditions prior to freezing-thawing. This was done by evaluating evaporation characteristics, water retention, and Atterberg limits on five soil series of differing textures as affected by SAP application rates (0, 40, 80, and 200 mg SAP kg(-1 )dry soil). Then, soil columns with and without freeze-thaw cycles were evaluated for each SAP rate to determine if SAP amplified freezing-thawing to remediate compaction. This was done by observing changes in soil bulk density, peak penetration resistance, and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) as indicators of compaction. Results demonstrated that increasing SAP rates significantly decreased evaporative water losses, increased water retention, and increased the liquid limit. In a field setting, these trends would set antecedent soil conditions that favor the remediation of compaction during subsequent winter freeze-thaw cycles. Results also demonstrated that SAP significantly affected the freezing-thawing process on some indicators of soil compaction. Increases in SAP rates significantly decreased peak penetration resistance, had mixed effects on Ksat, but no effect on bulk density. This suggests particle rearrangement is occurring internally (i.e., aggregation) even though changes in bulk density are not evident. Application of SAP appears to have potential for amplifying the remediation of soil compaction during winter in frigid, semiarid environments.

AB  - This article examines the link between logistics indicators and economic growth in Kazakhstan in the period 1995-2019. Factors and the causal relationship between the indicators of transport development and economic growth, using the models of total production, demand and vector error correction, are studied. The analysis established specifics of the relationship between indicators of various types of transport and economic growth and their mutual influence, both in terms of directions and the nature of the relationship. A bi-directional cause-and-effect relationship between railway transport infrastructure and economic growth has been identified according to the Granger test. It was found that in a small economy, road and sea transport in the long term will lead to a higher rate of economic growth, and vice versa, economic growth encourages the development of pipeline transport and this in turn, in a one-way direction, stimulates the development of all other types of transport. It was revealed that economic growth in Kazakhstan leads to an increase in demand for transport and logistics services and their infrastructure to a lesser extent than in countries with large economies. To improve the effectiveness of the economy, a differentiated approach to transport policy is recommended depending on the highlighted long-term relationship between the studied parameters. Our research indicates that conditions for road and sea transport in Kazakhstan should be improved to stimulate economic growth. The results of the study can be used as recommendations for developing a long-term transport policy.

AB  - The occurrence of surface condensation and mould can lead to concerns of poor indoor air quality and adverse health implications of occupants. Remedial actions require identification of the root causes, but this can be challenging even for experts. The focus of the research is the development of a diagnostic tool that helps to streamline root cause analysis. The diagnostic method comprises a protocol with guidelines for installation of sensors, easy data collection, and a set of calculations to process environmental information. Environmental parameters collected and calculated from an environmental monitoring exercise of dwellings with and without mould, include physical properties associated with the indoor surface of external walls and surrounding air conditions. The methodology relies on linking specific surface and air environmental parameters together with critical thresholds proposed for the control and avoidance of surface condensation and mould growth in dwellings. These parameters were assessed and used to determine the likely causal factors of a moisture imbalanced environment leading to surface condensation and mould growth; poor thermal building envelope performance, an imbalanced heat-moisture regime, and/or insufficient ventilation. Examples from different scenarios are presented to show the process towards environmental data collection, post-processing to compute and assess pertinent parameters, and the display of environmental conditions in a clear and easy-to-interpret manner. The novel developed system is a time-saving method for processing and represents environmental data. It provides a straightforward building moisture index (BMI) and a systematic diagnostic procedure for environmental assessment and possible causes of mould growth. This helps to support neutral decision making, to identify rectification strategies and direct to more cost-efficient solutions to existing damp and mould problems in buildings.

AB  - The key to the utility of foraminifers as paleo-environmental indicators for coral reefs is the knowledge of modern assemblages in relation to environmental conditions. This study examined 44 surface-sediment samples from three small islands in Yongle Atoll, with the goal to investigate the relationship between foraminiferal distribution and environmental characterization. In samples, 192 foraminiferal species belonging to 74 genera were identified, among which the hyaline foraminifers totally dominated. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis resulted in the identification of three foraminiferal biofacies, representing different environmental settings and sedimentary regimes. (1) The Amphistegina (mainly Amphistegina lobifera) facies characterizes the upper fore-reef slope zone, which experiences strong wave action and currents from the open sea. (2) The Calcarina hispida-Neorotalia calcar facies represents the reef flat and lagoon slope zone, and patch reefs in the lagoon basin, which is the shallowest of all the biofacies, exposed to the strong solar radiation and strong hydrodynamic activity. (3) The Quinqueloculina crassa subcuneata-Elphidium advenum facies characterizes the lagoon basin, which is covered by fine sands and muds with abundant Halimeda fragments to water depths < 15 m. Bivariate Correlation Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis indicate that the spatial distributions of foraminifers in Yongle Atoll are associated with water depth and sediment texture. Other environmental factors, including hydrodynamic energy, substratum type and light intensity also influence the foraminiferal biofacies. Finally, we summarized our results into a foraminiferal distribution model for the purpose of interpreting modern and paleo environmental conditions in atolls in the South China Sea.

AB  - Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury is a major cause of acute kidney injury. In the present study, we investigated the effects of pioglitazone on hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury in rat renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) under normal- (NG) or high-glucose (HG) culture conditions via evaluating oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). The RTECs (NRK-52E cells) were divided into six groups as follows: NG group, HG group, NG + H/R group, HG + H/R group, NG + Pio + H/R group, and HG + Pio + H/R group, among which cells in H/R groups were subjected to 4 h of hypoxia followed by 12 h of reoxygenation. After that, the cells were evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay for the determination of their viability and flow cytometry assay for the detection of apoptosis. The levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GSH), catalase (CAT), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined via colorimetric chemical assays. In addition, the expression of ERS-associated proteins, i.e. ATF4, ATF6, GRP78, and CHOP, was determined via western blotting. A HG environment could reduce the viability and increase the apoptotic rate of NRK-52E cells with increased MDA levels and decreased SOD, CAT, and GSH levels, and upregulate the expression of ERS-associated proteins, i.e. ATF4, ATF6, and GRP78. H/R injury could further aggravate changes in the above indicators, but pioglitazone could significantly reverse such changes and alleviate cell injury. Thus, Pioglitazone exhibits a cytoprotective effect on RTECs against H/R injury under NG or HG culture conditions by inhibiting oxidative stress and ERS.

AB  - Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) is related to many factors resulting from continuous interaction between location, building characteristics, installed heating, cooling and air conditioning systems and user specifics. Many recent studies claim that socioeconomic status of the household has a significant effect on IEQ. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted in order to assess the possible correlations between socioeconomic status and perceived IEQ in Slovenian households (n=714). Information on these is an aid in defining recommendations towards comfortable and healthy indoor environments. The unit of observation was a household in Slovenia, reported by an individual member. The study period was May-July, 2017. The survey consisted of 36 questions, divided into five sections: personal and demographic details, characteristics of households, energy efficiency, self-perceived IEQ, occupant behaviour, everyday activities for improving IEQ. Response rate was 64.9%. An univariate statistical analysis was followed by a Chi square test. The analysis showed that there exist a correlation between socioeconomic status of households and perceived IEQ. No correlation was found between socioeconomic status of households and performed energy efficiency measures, whereas improved building energy efficiency contributed to higher level of perceived IEQ in households. Opposite to scientific findings, the most important reason for investing in energy efficiency measures was found to be the reduction of energy consumption and not the improvement of IEQ conditions. The findings are important not only for single renovations, which should be primarily aimed at ensuring quality indoor environment, but also for determining policies and strategies at the national level, taking into account the socioeconomic indicators.

AB  - The use of less invasive methods to assess the biological effects of xenobiotics on aquatic species is currently a research priority. Fish skin mucus appears as a promising biological matrix, allowing the assessment of biochemical endpoints with the advantage of non-invasive sampling. This study aimed to compare the sensitivity of plasma and skin mucus matrices in a marine fish, Sparus aurata, after 24 and 96 h exposure to 0.5 and 50 mu g.L-1 of 37 nm citrate coated gold nanoparticles (AuNP). Results showed a higher responsiveness of skin mucus, after 24 h exposure, in terms of total antioxidant capacity (TAC), as demonstrated by its increase for both concentrations when compared to the single increase, found in the 0.5 mu g.L-1 condition in blood plasma. The total oxidative status levels (TOS) did not appear as promising in skin mucus under the tested conditions, presenting levels below the detection limit whereas in blood plasma TOS levels were quantifiable and significantly increased after 96 h. Esterase activity (EA) was decreased in skin mucus after 24 h exposure to 0.5 mu g.L-1 AuNP, remaining unaltered in blood plasma. Cortisol, the main stress indicator in fishes, presented unaltered levels in both biological matrices and a positive correlation was found between cortisol and TAC. Overall, results support the use of skin mucus as a biological matrix and TAC and EA as potential biomarkers to monitor the effects of NP effects in fishes.

AB  - Saliva is a complex body fluid that has various functions in the oral cavity. Central nervous system has the most important role in regulating salivation. Saliva as a sample is suitable for simplicity of sampling and because it contains analytes in the free active form. Stress is a condition in which the internal (psychophysical) balance of the body is disturbed. It activates the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, so salivary cortisol is a free cortisol indicator that correlates well with its serum value and reflects the free fraction that is biologically active. At the same time, stress conditions stimulate the sympathetic neuronal system causing change in the secretion of salivary alpha-amylase from salivary glands.The hypothesis of this study was that students with daily intensive physical activity are exposed to chronic stress compared to other students who have minimal physical activity. The study included 54 healthy volunteers, students of the University of Zagreb, divided into two groups. One volunteer group consisted of physically active volunteers (n=27) from the Faculty of Kinesiology (FK), and the other group consisted of physically inactive volunteers (n=27) from other faculties (OF). The subjects were first administered a psychological test that consisted of two questionnaires, Qiality of Life Qiestionnaire and Questionnaire of Stressful Styles, and then underwent sampling of saliva. By comparing biochemical and psychological indicators in relation to stress, it was concluded that the two groups of students were equalized and that there was no objective support for either group to be considered exposed to chronic stress. Despite the substantial differences in physical activity, there was no difference between the two student populations.

AB  - Introduction: In developing countries, the rapid increase in noncommunicable diseases burden has been accompanied by socio-demographic changes, such as rapid urbanization, with persistence of considerable socio-economic gaps between populations. In Argentina, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cancer are leading causes of death. The aim of this study was to identify geographic clustering of mortality rates related to both diseases in Argentina and to assess their association with two large-scale societal factors, urbanization and poverty contexts.
   Materials and methods: We performed an ecological study in Argentina (n = 525 counties), 2009-2011 period. Using spatial analysis techniques we identified and mapped spatial clusters of high and low values for age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) of cancer or CVD and for selected urbanization and poverty indicators. We estimated incidence-rate ratios using two-level Poisson regression models, which accounted for rates distribution spatial variability.
   Results: Cancer and CVD mortality rates distribution were spatially dependent. Population growth showed an inverse association with ASMR from these causes, for both sexes. We detected an additive interaction of effects between urban scale and poverty level, being the "rural poverty" associated with an increasing risk of mortality by cancer (in both sexes) or by CVD (only men), compared to contexts with high urban scale and low poverty level. Counties with an intermediate urban scale seem to present the most favorable context, even when their socio-economic conditions are more unfavorable than those with higher urbanization levels.
   Conclusions: Geographical differences in urban and socioeconomic contextual conditions can explain spatial variation in NCD mortality burden in Argentina. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A deep understanding of the interaction and competition between different gases on adsorption processes is essential for the design and optimization of industrial units. Two biomass-derived activated carbons (CS-CO2 and CS-H2O), synthesized in our laboratory, were evaluated as selective adsorbents for the separation of CO2 from CO2/CH4 mixtures. Adsorption isotherms of the pure gases (i.e., CO2 and CH4) were performed in a high-pressure magnetic suspension balance at three different temperatures (303, 323 and 343 K) up to 1000 kPa and the data were correlated using the Sips and Toth models. The Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) was applied to predict the binary adsorption equilibrium. The results were validated by means of experimental breakthrough tests in a fixed-bed set-up. The isosteric heats of adsorption were estimated from the pure component adsorption data by means of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation and the Sips and Toth equations. All of the equilibrium data were integrated in a performance indicator defined so as to be able to evaluate the adsorbent in terms of selectivity, working capacity and adsorption enthalpy under conditions relevant to the specific application. Although both CS activated carbons had similar textural features, CS-CO2 showed a better overall performance than CS-H2O for the separation of CO2 from CO2/CH4 mixtures. Our results highlight the importance of carrying out a deep analysis of the adsorption equilibrium under conditions relevant to the foreseen application in order to identify the most suitable adsorbent.

AB  - The cerium anomalies preserved in the Chalk have been investigated as possible palaeoredox indicators of the Late Cretaceous Sea and its sediment. This has been based upon over a hundred new rare earth element analyses of selected samples and gram size fractions from the Chalk. Particular attention has been given to the methodology of differentiating between the cerium anomalies preserved in the bioclastic calcite and those in carbonate-fluorapatite preserved in the acetic acid insoluble residues of chalks. Variations in the cerium anomaly of different particle size fractions of uncemented chalks suggest that fractionation of rare earth elements between the Chalk's seawater and the various organisms that contributed skeletal material to the bioclastic calcite of the Chalk may have occurred. Post-depositional processes of calcite cementation and late diagenetic sulphidisation have had no apparent effect on the cerium anomaly of the acetic acid insoluble residues. The cerium anomalies associated with the acetic acid insoluble residues from (1) an alternating sequence of chalks and marls from Ballard Cliff (Dorset, UK) typical of Milankovitch cyclicity show a marked diagenetic pattern, whereas those from (2) non-volcanic and volcanic marls display a pattern that is best explained by the variations in the availability of phosphorus and the timing of argillisation of volcanic glass during diagenesis. The general conclusion is drawn that the cerium anomalies preserved in the Chalk can provide an insight into the changing palaeoredox conditions in the Late Cretaceous Sea as well as in the pore fluids of its sediments.

AB  - Water and light are two important resources for red beet (Beta vulgaris var. conditiva Alef.) survival, growth and yield. Changes in leaf traits can be regarded as indicators for detection of crop responses to environmental stress, and could be utilized to select genotypes suitable for stressed environments. The objectives of the current study were to explore the adaptive changes of morphological and physiological leaf traits of red beet to water and light stress, and identify traits as potential suitable selection indicators in breeding programs. Red beet was treated with RED (red/far red ratio (R/FR): 1.29; transmitted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR): 66.9%), GREEN (R/FR: 0.43; PAR: 25.8%) photo-selective films, and with two water conditions i.e., 50% of water holding capacity (WHC) (W50) and 30% of WHC (W30). Plants subjected to GREEN had higher specific leaf area (SLA) (248.6 cm(2) g(-1)) and leaf area ratio (LAR) (232.2 cm(2) g(-1)) and lower soil-plant analysis development (SPAD) and water index (WI) (1.076) values. Water stress reduced leaf area index (LAI) by 39 and 59% (W50 and W30, respectively), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), and leaf zinc accumulation. Conversely, water shortage enhanced SLA, leaf mass ratio (LMR) (0.786 and 0.761 g g(-1) for W50 and W30, respectively) and chlorophyll concentration. Red beet showed a strong plasticity under unfavorable growth conditions. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that suitable selection indicators of early adaptive changes were LMR, WI for drought and SLA, LAR for modification of PAR transmittance.

AB  - The state-of-the-science in sustainability assessment of soil and groundwater remediation is evaluated with the application of four decision support systems (DSSs) to a large-scale brownfield revitalization case study. The DSSs were used to perform sustainability appraisals of four technically feasible remediation alternatives proposed for the site.
   The first stage of the review compares the scope of each tool's sustainability indicators, how these indicators are measured and how the tools differ in terms of standardization and weighting procedures. The second stage of the review compares the outputs from the tools and determines the key factors that result in differing results between tools.
   The evaluation of indicator sets and tool structures explains why the tools generate differing results. Not all crucial impact areas, as identified by sustainable remediation forums, are thoroughly considered by the tools, particularly with regard to the social and economic aspects of sustainability. Variations in boundary conditions defined between technologies, produce distorted environmental impact results, especially when in-situ and ex-situ technologies are compared. The review draws attention to the need for end users to be aware of which aspects of sustainability are considered, how the aspects are measured and how all aspects are ultimately balanced in the evaluation of potential remediation strategies. Existing tools can be improved by considering different technologies within the same boundary conditions and by expanding indicator sets to include indicators deemed to be relevant by remediation forums.

AB  - The contamination of fresh water with pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) has risen during the last few years. The adsorption of some PPCPs namely, Diclofenac-Na, Naproxen, Gemfibrozil and Ibuprofen from aqueous solution has been studied, magnetic nanoparticles coated zeolite (MNCZ) has been used as the adsorbent. Batch adsorption experiment was conducted to study the influences of different adsorption parameters such as contact time, solution pH and PPCPs concentrations in order to optimize the reaction conditions. The removal was favored at low pH values. Thus, as pH turns from acidic to basic conditions these compounds were less efficiently removed. The initial concentration does not appear to exert a noticeable effect on the removal efficiency of the studied PPCPs at low concentrations, but it showed less removal efficiency during high concentration of PPCPs especially for Ibuprofen. The removal of Diclofenac-Na was independent on time, while the contact time was of significant effect on the adsorption of Naproxen, Gemfibrozil and Ibuprofen even though these compounds were removed up to 95% during 10 min using MNCZ. From the isotherm adsorption study, the adsorption of PPCPs studied on MNCZ was best fitted with Freundlich isotherm equation. Pseudo-second order model providing the best fit model with the experimental data. Column adsorption study was conducted to compare the removal efficiency of MNCZ with other processes used at drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs), MNCZ showed high removal efficiency (>99%) than other used processes at DWTPs.

AB  - The California ribbed mussel Mytilus californianus (Conrad 1837) is a dominant intertidal species that ranges from Alaska (USA) to Baja California (Mexico) along the west coast of North America. Despite its broad latitudinal range, which results in populations living at widely different temperatures, multiple studies have concluded that this species is genetically homogenous. This may be due to high gene flow, which would inhibit local adaptation, and lack of strong post-settlement selection pressure, which would not favor shifts in allelic frequencies among sites. We investigated several physiological traits that show temperature-adaptive variation in other Mytilus species. We sampled populations of M. californianus at 7 sites across 33 of latitude to test for the possibility of local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity. Individuals acclimated to common conditions were examined for possible differences in whole-organism thermal tolerance. The most northern population (Tatoosh Island) had a significantly lower survival rate following an acute heat stress event than the other populations. Additional physiological processes were examined that affect thermal optima and limits: critical thermal maximum (Hcrit) of cardiac function and metabolic capacity (as indexed by tissue activity of an indicator enzyme, malate dehydrogenase). Tatoosh mussels had a significantly lower Hcrit than other sites, indicating that this population may be adapted to cooler conditions compared to other populations. Metabolic activity did not correlate with latitude of collection. Phenotypic plasticity at the adult stage did not explain differences in thermal tolerance. Thus, genetic differences (local adaptation or balanced polymorphism), developmental plasticity, maternal effects, or within-site thermal heterogeneity may be responsible for the observed variation among populations.

AB  - The Maillard reaction products (MRPs) most widely used as markers of the nutritional quality of foods are furosine, N(epsilon)-carboxymethyllysine (CML), hydroxymethylfurfural, pyrraline, pentosidine and pronyl-lysine. One of the MRPs identified first was furosine, which was quantified in foods 40 years ago as a chemical indicator of the Amadori compound N(epsilon)-fructoselysine. Since then, furosine has gained broad attention by food chemists and biomedical researchers, as its formation upon heat treatment is well characterised. Moreover, it represents the Amadori products from early Maillard reactions in which amino acids react with reducing carbohydrates, resulting in a loss of their availability. This is of importance for the essential amino acid lysine, which is also the limiting amino acid in many proteins. In order to evaluate the nutritional quality of a protein, the concomitant analysis of free - and nutritionally available - lysine and the amount of lysine reacted to form the respective MRP is essential, even for mildly processed foods. The other chemical markers of heat treatment such as CML, pyrraline, pentosidine or pronyl-lysine seem to be useful markers of the advanced stages of Maillard reactions. Compared to the conditions in which furosine is formed, these compounds are generated under more severe conditions of heat treatment. However, the concentrations analysed are significantly lower than those of furosine. Therefore, the nutritional evaluation of a food protein should include not only furosine, but also other chemical markers of heat treatment such as, for example, CML, pyrraline and pentosidine.

AB  - The sedimentary record of fiords at high latitude where global change may be occurring earliest and will be greatest has the potential for assessment of environmental change at both low resolution (the scale of millennia) and high resolution (decadal to less than daily). Unlike the lacustrine record which has been used very successfully in these studies, the sedimentary processes and thus the sedimentary deposits of fiords differ (1) in the role of salt water in inhibiting mixing and promoting flocculation, and through the role of sea-ice, (2) in the exchange of mass and energy with the much larger ocean beyond, and (3) in the role of benthic biota in the sedimentary environment. The work reviewed in this paper shows that fiord sediments are being used to assess sedimentary and oceanic processes, as well as glacial, periglacial and geomorphic history, and that they are important proxies for long-term climate and hydrology. Recommendations for advancing this work include long-term monitoring of conditions in fiords and their drainage basins so that the transfer relations can be more solidly constructed from the proxy of fiord sediment. Integration of results from fiords in opposite polar latitudes, and among proxies especially from lacustrine and ice-core records will produce valuable insights. Assessment of the range of conditions in fiords from the most polar to temperate regions is important to building models of their processes and understanding of the paleoenvironmental signals that can be interpreted from each type.

AB  - Landslides, like most natural disturbances, facilitate the evolution of new plant species. Hence, a detail characterization of topographic conditions can improve the prediction and mapping of species in such complex terrains. Within the Outer (Flysch) Upper Carpathian region, south Poland, we analyze the role of convergence points prepared in a previous study from slope and slope exposition (aspect) data, derived from a 1 m digital elevation model. Convergence points reflected microscale variability in topographic conditions and were analyzed in this study as convergence point density (CPD). Our objective was to use CPD to predict species richness on forested landslides using three geostatistical methods; Ordinary kriging (OK), Ordinary cokriging (OCK), and regression kriging (RK). Our results showed a relatively high correlation (r similar to 0.65) between species richness and CPD compared to slope or slope exposition or with both. OCK and RK generally improved prediction. However, the application of cokriging in such terrains remains challenging and will not be appropriate, particularly if species richness has a small sample size. RK outperformed OK and OCK, decreasing the root mean square error (RMSE) by 33% and 10%, respectively. RK was also more robust to topographic heterogeneity and the limited number of observations than OCK. We conclude that a denser sampling of species composition or a more robust indicator is needed to improve these results. Notwithstanding these limitations, our results can be used as the first step to support short-term conservation efforts, especially when time-dependent changes in species composition are unimportant.

AB  - The impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns on air quality around the world have received wide attention. In comparison, assessments of the implications for water quality are relatively rare. As the first country impacted by COVID-19, China implemented local and national lockdowns that shut down industries and businesses between January and May 2020. Based on monthly field measurements (N = 1693) and daily automonitoring (N = 65), this study analyzed the influence of the COVID-19 lockdown on river water quality in China. The results showed significant improvements in river water quality during the lockdown period but out-of-step improvements for different indicators. Reductions in ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) began relatively soon after the lockdown; chemical oxygen demand (COD) and dissolved oxygen (DO) showed improvements beginning in late January/early February and mid-March, respectively, while increases in pH were more temporally concentrated in the period from mid-March to early May. Compared to April 2019, the Water Quality Index increased at 67.4% of the stations in April 2020, with 75.9% of increases being significant. Changes in water quality parameters also varied spatially for different sites and were mainly determined by the locations and levels of economic development. After the lifting of the lock-down in June, all water quality parameters returned to pre-COVID-19 lockdown conditions. Our results clearly demonstrate the impacts of human activities on water quality and the potential for reversing ecosystem degradation by better management of wastewater discharges to replicate the beneficial impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown.
   Capsule summary: River water quality improved during China's COV1D-19 lockdown, but returned to normal conditions after the lockdown. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to the loss of the dominance of GDP as the main macroeconomic indicator of the social welfare, this study uses a more accurate and realistic indicator - adjusted net savings (ANS). Based on the economic and mathematical modelling, the study suggests a new method for identifying the value of adjusted net savings as a stimulating factor to increase the inflow of transnational capital to the recipient country. After assessing the current environment of investment attractiveness of recipient countries, attention was paid to identifying the degree of dependence of foreign direct investment on adjusted net savings. The novelty of this study is conditioned by the search and identification of the dominant macroeconomic indicator of investment attractiveness of the recipient country. Such an indicator will most fully reveal the conditions and prospects for attracting investments. The aim of this study was to consider alternative approaches to the country's development and to demonstrate the existence of a functional relationship between the volume of foreign direct investment and adjusted net savings. The purpose of this study is to build models of the dependence of foreign direct investment on adjusted net savings of the recipient country as an alternative indicator that most widely reveals the level of social welfare and economic development of the studied countries. Adjusted net savings consist of elements that cover the sustainable development of society, namely the economic, environmental, and social components. As a result, using the correlation and analysis of variance, the existence of dependence and its degree of influence on the volume of foreign direct investment on the adjusted net savings of the recipient country has been proved.

AB  - Introduction Violence against medical staff has been prevalent in China over the past two decades. Although Chinese authorities have released many laws and regulations to protect medical staff from violence since 2011, the legal approach alone is unlikely to resolve this complex issue. In particular, several cases of violence against medical staff in China have caused great media sensation. Method This paper proposes an integrated model that combines the environmental stimuli theory, broken windows theory, and rational choice theory. It adopts the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to untangle the causal relationship between violence against medical staff, media sensation, and judicial judgment. We examined reports of medical violence on media and news websites from January 1, 2010, to January 31, 2020, and selected 50 cases with detailed information for this study. Results The results show that each condition is not sufficient for the absence of judicial judgment, but when combined, they are conducive to the outcome. The conditions of hospital level, medical cost, and media sensation play important roles. The providers, patients, and environmental factors are indicators of inadequate or lack of judicial judgment, which corresponds to previous expectations. Conclusions The integrated model greatly enriches the extant theories and literature, and also yields implications for preventing violence against medical staff in China. We suggest that sustainable and innovative healthcare reform should be initiated. For example, public hospitals should remain the cornerstone of national public health security. Medical staff in public hospitals must be regarded as "civil servants". Therefore, the current legal system should be improved. The media should objectively report events concerning medical staff and improve public healthcare knowledge.

AB  - Zoxamide is a recently discovered chiral fungicide that applied to agricultural production, but the potential environmental risk may be underestimated because the risk posed by either enantiomer has not been adequately assessed. Therefore, systemic evaluation of zoxamide was first carried out at the enantiomeric level. Enantioselective bioactivity against target pathogens (Phytophthora capsici Leonian, Alternaria solani, Botryis cinerea, Colletotrichum gloeosprioides Penz, Phytophthora sojae Kaufmann & Gerdemann) was explored, and the order of the bioactivity was R-zoxamide > Rac-zoxamide > S-zoxamide, with a 9.9- to 140.0-times difference between two enantiomers. Molecular docking simulation was utilized to clarify the mechanism underlying the observed differences in enantioselective bioactivity, and the result indicated that a difference of Van der waals force between R/S-zoxamide and the specific receptor gave rise to the different antifungal activity. The enantioselective toxicity result demonstrated that R-zoxamide had 4.9- to 10.8- times greater acute toxicity to Selenastrum capricornutum and Daphnia magna than S-zoxamide. S-zoxamide degraded faster under aerobic condition in all three types of soils, giving rise to an enrichment of high-risk R-enantiomer. Under anaerobic condition, however, no significant difference in dissipation rate was observed between two enantiomers. R-zoxamide was 1.5- to 3.5-times more bioactive and 1.1- to 1.5-times more toxic than Rac-zoxamide, which means developing R-zoxamide instead of racemate is a potential way to reduce pesticide dosage without loss of efficacy against target organisms and that an inactive isomer would no more be released to the environment. This study may have implications for better practical application and environmental risk assessment of zoxamide enantiomers.

AB  - The larger and deeper lakes and ponds are, the better the conditions for spontaneous water purification, slower hydrobiological processes and slower accumulation of sediment. The goal of this research was to assess the ecological status of selected Lithuanian lentic water bodies and the impact of morphometric indicators on water quality. Multiple studies were conducted on 29 lakes and 10 ponds located throughout Lithuania in 2014-2018. The study proved that higher maxima and average depths of lakes correlate with lower P-total. N-total yield and macrophyte taxonomic composition values, indicating higher ecological status class. Higher chlorophyll a EQR, ichthyofauna taxonomic composition indicator for Lithuanian fish index LFI and Lithuanian lakes' macroinvertebrate index indicates a higher ecological class. Larger lake areas contain smaller amounts of P-total and N-total, indicating better ecological status class; higher ichthyophane taxonomic composition in LFI, zoobenthos taxonomic composition indicator for Lithuanian lakes' macroinvertebrates index (LLMI) and taxonomic composition of macrophytes MRI indicate better ecological status class. Larger lake areas contain lower chlorophyll a EQR values. Rapid water exchange improves the condition of the lake in addition to nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorophyll a EQR values. The faster the water exchange in the lake is, the lower the P-total and N-total values; faster water exchange in the lake also means higher chlorophyll a EQR values. However, slower water exchange indicates better ecological status of the macrophytic taxonomic composition of the MRI, the ichthyofauna taxonomic composition and the Lithuanian lakes' macroinvertebrates index indicator of zoobenthos.

TI  - DIFFERENT WAYS TO CUT A CAKE: COMPARING EXPERT-BASED AND STATISTICAL TYPOLOGIES TO TARGET SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION TECHNOLOGIES, A CASE-STUDY IN SOUTHERN ETHIOPIA
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA  - English
KW  - TRAJECTORIES
AB  - Understanding farm diversity is essential to delineate recommendation domains for new technologies, but diversity is a subjective concept, and can be described differently depending on the way it is perceived. Historically, new technologies have been targeted primarily based on agro-ecological conditions, largely ignoring socioeconomic conditions. Based on 273 farm households' surveys in Ethiopia, we compare two approaches for the delineation of farm type recommendation domains for crop and livestock technologies: one based on expert knowledge and one based on statistical methods. The expert-based typology used a simple discriminant key for stakeholders in the field to define four farm types based on Tropical Livestock Unit, total cultivated surface and the ratio of these two indicators. This simple key took only a few minutes to make inferences about the potential of adoption of crop and livestock technologies. The PCA-HC analysis included a greater number of variables describing the farm (land use, household size, cattle, fertilizer, off-farm work, hiring labour, production). This analysis emphasized the multi-dimensional potential of such a statistical approach and, in principle, its usefulness to grasp the full complexity of farming systems to identify their needs in crop and livestock technologies. A sub-sampling approach was used to test the impact of data selection on the diversity represented in the statistical approach. Our results show that diversity structure is significantly impacted according to the choice of a sub-sample of 15 of the 20 variables available. This paper shows the complementarity of the two approaches and demonstrates the influence of data selection within large baseline data sets on the total diversity represented in the clusters identified.

AB  - This work explores the issues on the development of resource-saving methods and approaches of meat production, taking into account the innovation and efficiency factors. Using the synthesis, analysis, comparisons, as well as logical, process and system approaches, it is found that many scientists define the "resource-saving" concept often too narrow and trivial, using limited one-way approach to the interpretation of the substantive essence of the definitions and explications of this category. Many scientists consider only the material and financial components, without taking into account the fact the process of resource management and the very essence of a lean approach to the production management system. The resource efficiency management process can improve the quality management system of finished products and the technological process, organizing the transport and logistics and storage conditions (raw materials, food, products), as well as environmental measures. This work highlights and systematizes the main indicators of enterprise resource efficiency, and formulates the conditions for improving the resource efficiency. This study finds that modern enterprises are required to implement the principles of resource-saving: scientific substantiation, complexity, and cost-effectiveness. The resource-saving strategy gives a permanent reduction in resource consumption per unit of the resulting beneficial effect. Also, this paper elaborates the main areas of resource-saving in the agro-industrial sector. The most promising areas of processing and practical use of waste and secondary raw materials of meat production and international experience are proposed. (C) 2019 INT TRANS J ENG MANAG SCI TECH.

AB  - This study evaluates the transport of leaching water infiltration from waste rock piles on the surrounding groundwater, using Anhui, China, as an example. Based on a detailed analysis of hydrogeological conditions in the study area, a numerical groundwater model was established to simulate the transport of a specific pollutant (manganese). The distribution and levels of manganese pollution in the groundwater environment caused by the infiltration of leachate were assessed for different operating conditions using MODFLOW and MT3D module. The results show that without anti-seepage measures in place in the waste rock piles, the concentration of manganese in the center point of the rock pile reaches the maximum allowable value of 0.1mg/l by the second year. The maximum horizontal diffusion distance was 188 m. The concentration of manganese in the center point reached 0.45 mg/l by the tenth year, which is 4.5 times more than the allowable value, and the diffusion area was approximately 0.06 km(2). As a result of leachate infiltration, bedrock aquifers in the study area will be polluted. However, if anti-seepage measures are in place with an impermeable layer with a vertical permeability coefficient of 1x10(-7)cm/s, then the maximum concentration of manganese in the center of the waste rock piles is reduced to 0.08 mg/l by the tenth year. This is within the allowable limits. Therefore, we concluded that leachate from the waste rock piles will lead to high levels of manganese in the underlying aquifers, and that anti-seepage measures must be taken to prevent this.

AB  - Introduction
   The objective was to analyze whether socioeconomic factors related to the context and those related to the model of care - specifically the coverage of primary care by the Family Health Strategy (ESF) - had an impact on hospitalizations due to heart failure (HF) and stroke, in the State of Sao Paulo/Brazil between 1998 and 2013.
   Methods
   A longitudinal ecological study involving 645 municipalities was conducted in the state of Sao Paulo/Brazil from 1998 to 2013, using the Hospital Information System (SIH - DataSUS database). The hospitalizations for primary care sensitive conditions: Stroke and heart failure (HF) that correspond to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD 10): I50, I63 to I67; I69, G45 to G46 were analyzed longitudinally during the period indicated regarding the percentage of people covered by the Family Health Program (PSF) adjusted for confounders (population size, gross domestic product -GDP and human development index-HDI).
   Results
   There was a significant decrease in the number of hospitalizations for heart failure and stroke per 10000 (inhabitants) in the period (p < 0.0001), with a significant relationship with increased proportion of ESF (p < 0.0001), and this remained significant even when possible confounders (population size, GDP and HDI) were included in the model (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusions
   GDP per capita was close to or higher than that if many European countries, which shows the relevance of the study. The health care model based on the Family Health Strategy positively impacted hospitalization indicators for heart failure and stroke, indicating that this model is effective in the prevention of primary care sensitive conditions.

AB  - Reaction of the plant body in polluted conditions allows estimating the anthropogenic impact on the environment. The aim of this work is to study anatomical and morphological changes of juniper in terms of the polymetallic pollution of the environment and under the influence of heavy metals. The assessment of some heavy metals impact on juniper was conducted after the planting of seed samples in the soil and obtaining good germination. The juniper has been treated with heavy metal solutions in the lab for 4 months. To determine the anatomical structures of the leaves of the juniper, the samples were fixed by the Strasburger-Fleming method. Under the influence of urban air, negative anatomical and morphological changes of juniper were discovered, the significant increase in the thickness of the needles, the thickness of the conducting bundle and the thickness of the epidermis was noted, that, apparently, provides higher resistance to man-induced pollution. It is shown that the process of environmental restoration can be done due to self-purification by using adsorption properties of leaves of woody plants, for example juniper, that is able to absorb heavy metals (lead, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, nickel, zinc and copper) from urban air. It was first discovered that the effects of heavy metals (lead and nickel) as the nutrient medium leads to the significant changes of the leaves' anatomical structure (the swelling of the phloem, some decondensation in the mesophyll). The research results allow recommending the juniper for phytoremediation, bioindication and landscape gardening of cities and settlements in different countries.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of hazelnut skin extract powder (HEP) and -tocopherol addition to zein coating on lipid oxidation, texture, and moisture content of roasted hazelnuts. Total phenolic content of hazelnut skin extracted with three different solvents (acetone, ethanol, methanol) under hot (50 degrees C) and cold (29 degrees C) conditions were determined. The highest phenolic content (652.6 mg GAE/g) was achieved by using methanol as solvent at 50 degrees C. Uncoated and coated hazelnuts were subjected to accelerated shelf-life testing at 40 degrees C for 5 months. Peroxide value, free acidity, K-232, and K-270 values of oil fraction of hazelnuts were measured at each month as indicators of oxidative rancidity. All coatings significantly reduced the investigated parameters indicating that they are all effective in prevention of oxidation. -Tocopherol incorporated coating provided the lowest PV (1.21 meqO(2)/kg) and K-232 (3.03) values at the end of storage period and also it has the smoothest outer surface appearance. Hardness values and moisture contents of coated and uncoated hazelnuts remained unchanged during storage.
   Practical applicationsApplication of zein coating reduced the oxidative rancidity of roasted hazelnuts without producing significant changes in its color, texture, or moisture content at ambient storage conditions. Incorporation of -tocopherol improved the coating performance while incorporation of HEP did not at the level of 0.5% (w/v). This study shows that the shelf-life of roasted hazelnuts may be enhanced by coating with zein solution containing natural antioxidant.

AB  - The timing of the rise of C-4 grasses and the climatic conditions driving their expansion are widely debated, with recent studies suggesting that the expansion was more complex than previously thought. Proxy reconstructions from northwestern Argentina record multiple increases and decreases in C-4 abundance throughout the late Miocene to early Pliocene, as well as variations in the timing of the spread of C-4 grasses into the region. Here we present a multi-proxy paleovegetation reconstruction of the proportions of C-3 and C-4 vegetation using organic carbon and phytoliths preserved in paleosols at Entre Rios in the Santa Maria Basin of Catamarca, Argentina between 6.2 and 3.3 Ma. Both delta C-13(org) and phytolith assemblages indicate a C-3 dominated ecosystem with no evidence for substantial amounts of C-4 vegetation from the late Miocene through mid-Pliocene, despite their rise to dominance elsewhere during this time. These data suggest that by 6.2 Ma the Santa Maria basin floor was at an elevation high enough to create locally cool conditions that allowed C-3 vegetation to outcompete C-4 grasses. Phytolith assemblages show that later uplift of the Sierra Calchaquies and Sierra Aconquija ranges through the Pliocene increased aridity and drove the expansion of C-3 grasses at the expense of palms and other forest indicators. This multi-proxy paleovegetation reconstruction demonstrates that tectonics played an important role in controlling the late Miocene expansion C-4 grasses by suppressing their spread into northwest Argentina.

AB  - Colors in feathers are produced by pigment deposition or by nanostructures within barbs or barbules. In the absence of pigments or nanostructures, light is scattered incoherently, producing white coloration. Honest advertisement models predict that ornamental colors evolve if they reliably signal individual properties such as viability, health, or nutritional state. In this study, we tested if (1) iridescent structural and (2) unpigmented plumage coloration signal male quality in the Blue-black Grassquit (Volatinia jacarina). During three reproductive seasons, we captured males and measured morphological variables and nuptial plumage coverage, and collected feathers for spectrometry. We found that saturation of the iridescent coloration was positively related to relative molting speed, indicating that males investing more in prenuptial molt also produced more saturated, UV-shifted plumage. Body condition was not related to brightness or saturation of the iridescent plumage, and no male morphological attributes were associated with the white underwing patch coloration or size. Our results suggest that patterns of molt, and possibly feather growth, may affect the organization of optical nanostructures responsible for iridescent coloration, and that the ontogeny of iridescent plumage ornaments must be taken into account in hypotheses concerning honest advertisement of such signals. Thus, coloration in this species may reliably reflect energy allocation to molting, constituting an honest indicator of male quality, life history decisions, or endocrine state. To our knowledge, this is the first report of natural variation in molting pattern being associated with sexually-selected structural color plumage.

AB  - This paper reviews and compares the condition of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) system in three countries in the East Africa region: Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania. The criteria used for the evaluation and the comparison of each system are based on the elements of the legal, administrative and procedural frameworks, as well as the context in which they operate. These criteria are adapted from the evaluation and quality control criteria derived from a number of literature sources. The study reveals that the EIA systems of Kenya and Tanzania are at a similar stage in their development. The two countries, the first to introduce the EIA concept into their jurisdiction in this part of Africa, therefore have more experience than Rwanda in the practice of environmental impact assessment, where the legislation and process requires more time to mature both from the governmental and societal perspective. The analysis of the administrative and procedural frameworks highlights the weakness in the autonomy of the competent authority, in all three countries. Finally a major finding of this study is that the contextual set up i.e. the socio-economic and political situation plays an important role in the performance of an EIA system. The context in developing countries is very different from developed countries where the EIA concept originates. Interpreting EIA conditions in countries like Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania requires that the analysis for determining the effectiveness of their systems should be undertaken within a relevant framework, taking into account the specific requirements of those countries.

AB  - Plankton tow samples collected from 2002 through 2009 indicate that Microcystis biovolume in western Lake Erie is often most dense in transition zone (TZ) waters between Maumee Bay and the center of the western basin. 17 waters are generally high in nutrients and turbidity, and concentrations of each decrease with distance from Maumee Bay. High Microcystis biovolume in the TZ suggests the possibility that the conditions in these waters support a greater Microcystis growth rate relative to the open lake. To test this hypothesis, during the 2008 bloom, Microcystis was collected from western Lake Erie for measurements of total protein content (TPC) as an indicator of growth rate potential and cellular nutrient content to indicate nutrient deficiencies. TPC results indicate that Microcystis in the TZ had a higher potential growth rate compared to offshore waters. TPC values in Maumee Bay were intermediate but not significantly different from the 17 and offshore. Nitrogen content of Microcystis remained high over the summer at all sites, despite very low dissolved nitrate concentrations and low total nitrogen-to-total phosphorus ratio in late summer in the lake. Ammonium level in the lake was constant during the summer, and likely provided the nitrogen source for Microcystis. Cellular phosphorus content varied between site and sample date suggesting that Microcystis was moderately phosphorus deficient. Quotas of micronutrient indicated that Microcystis was not deficient of micronutrients. Results of this study suggest the waters in and adjacent to Maumee Bay provide more favorable growth conditions for Microcystis than offshore waters.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to assess biodiversity among different habitats of an organic farm and the relationships between some soil properties, nematode taxonomic diversity, and soil food web condition. Eight habitats were studied in the farm: ponds, ditches, a riparian corridor, hedgerows, and four agricultural fields (mustard, oats, fallow, and legumes). The undisturbed riparian corridor had higher soil NO3--N and NH4+-N concentrations, and potentially mineralizable N and higher abundances of bacterivore nematodes and longer food webs. Canonical correlation analysis showed associations between habitats and nematode trophic groups: predatory and bacterial-feeding nematodes in the riparian corridor and hedgerows, omnivore nematodes in the ponds and ditches, and fungal-feeding nematodes in the legume field. Soil chemical and physical properties mirrored the aboveground farm patterns and were more similar among habitats that were or had been cultivated, compared to the riparian corridor. Soil food web indices, based on functional analysis of nematode faunal composition, reflected the aboveground landscape heterogeneity. Discriminant analysis indicated that soil food web indices separated the two most disturbed habitats (ponds and tailwater ditches) from the two least disturbed habitats (the riparian corridor and hedgerows). The indices correlated with soil functioning as inferred by soil properties. Abundance of nematode taxa was not associated with aboveground landscape patterns. The complexity of the soil food web may have been influenced by (1) environmental factors that differed between years, (2) different time periods since disturbance in the various habitats, and (3) movement of nutrients and organisms by water flow between habitats in the farmscale.

AB  - This paper presents a bio-economic analysis of the hand-line and gillnet coastal fisheries off Pernambuco State, north-eastern Brazil, in order to define management measures to support the decision-making process available to fisheries managers to reduce uncertainties about the sustainable development of the fisheries. The objective of applying a bio-economic model was to reproduce the biological and economic conditions in which the fisheries occur. This was done by carrying out projections and simulations, starting from the current situation and going forward into the future with the purpose of analysing the behaviour of the fishery under different conditions, particularly different management measures. Six scenarios are presented, defined by different management regimes: Scenario 1: increase in catchability; Scenario 2: reduction in fuel price; Scenario 3: closed season; Scenario 4: reduction in the number of active boats; Scenario 5: reduction of catches of juveniles; and Scenario 6: joint implementation of biological, economic and technical management strategies. Management events were always introduced in the fifth year of the simulation, with the exception of Scenario 1, in which the event was introduced in the first year. For each of the five scenarios, a deterministic simulation was carried out with a Beverton-Holt model of the stock-recruitment relationship. Simulations were carried forward through a 30-year period. The best management strategy, in biological and economic terms, seems to be the joint application of several management measures that satisfy the claims of stakeholders, and permit a biological and economic equilibrium between the activity and the efforts to rebuild stocks.

AB  - The evolutionary importance of hybridization in wild plants and animals has become increasingly widely recognized in the last decade. In practical terms, hybridization provides an exceptionally tough set of problems for conservation biologists. We illustrate this in a case study of two Carabidae species widely used to evaluate the impact of human activities on biodiversity. These two species live in a complex mosaic of sympatry/allopatry and are known to hybridize in controlled conditions. Hybridization has not been quantified in natural populations to date due to the lack of a simple set of phenotypic traits for identifying hybrids. We thus screened for hybrids in natural populations, by multilocus genotyping at nine microsatellite loci. A high level of genetic differentiation between these two taxa was observed, as shown by allelic frequency distributions. Two Bayesian assignment procedures without obligatory pure taxon references were used to infer different classes of hybrids (F-1, F-2 and backcrosses) and mixture proportions between the two species. A low level of hybridization (F-1 genotypes) was observed in natural populations, contrasting with results obtained in controlled conditions. A high level of introgression was, however, detected at three of 12 sites, as revealed by the detection of backcrossed genotypes. This interspecific gene flow was detected in a limited zone of the common geographical range of the two species and was not related to the pattern of sympatry/allopatry. We then considered the origin and repercussions of this introgression, based on intraspecific genetic diversity and geographical structure.

AB  - This paper explores ways in which the analysis of microbial data from routine compliance monitoring, in combination with basic environmental data, can provide insight into the factors affecting faecal-indicator organism concentrations in coastal waters. In the case study presented, eight designated bathing waters on the Fylde coast are continuing to exhibit unreliable compliance with the Imperative standards for total coliform (TC) and faecal coliform (FC) concentrations specified in the EU Bathing Water Directive (76/160/EEC), despite significant reductions in geometric mean concentrations following recent major investment in the sewerage infrastructure. Faecal streptococci (FS) concentrations have remained high and have not been improved by the new sewerage schemes. The results suggest that, prior to the schemes, higher bacterial concentrations were strongly associated with rainfall: and sewage sources were important for TC and FC, but less important for FS, which may have been more strongly affected by diffuse catchment sources. In the post-schemes period, catchment sources appear to be of greater significance rainfall remains as a significant, though less important, predictors and tide height at time of sampling, together with variables such as sunshine and the proportion of onshore winds (which affect the survival and movement of bacteria that have already entered the coastal waters), assume greater significance. The approach used here provides a cost-effective management tool for the exploratory investigation of any monitoring point that is failing to meet recreational water quality standards.

AB  - Many factors associated with welfare of animals kept under extensive conditions differs from those in intensive systems. Across Europe both the welfare of the animals and the sustainability of production are under pressure. This paper concentrates on Scottish hill sheep systems because they provide particularly powerful examples of links between welfare, sustainability and forces to further extensify production, These systems are currently extensive with relatively little daily care of stock, Lamb mortality is taken as an indicator of welfare within the flock. Links are described between level of nutrition of the pregnant ewe, supervision and nutrition during the period of lambing and level of lamb mortality, The impact of reductions in flock income upon the capacity to support fixed costs, particularly those of labour are discussed. In a worked example, a 30% reduction in both flock size and income would need a 74% reduction in fixed costs to achieve the same flock gross margin. Converting this to labour saving would increase sheep to shepherd ratio from 817:1 to 1485:1. The impact of this type of reduction on animal care is discussed. A model considering shepherding at lambing time at different densities of sheep clearly demonstrates how more extensive stocking rates during lambing dramatically reduce the effectiveness of the shepherd and the number of sheep he can provide close attention to during lambing, It is concluded that forces to extensify already extensive systems are likely to lead to possibilities of poorer welfare through reduced animal care. Conflict is predicted between policies which seek to reduce stocking rates for environmental reasons and those that in combination achieve social and animal welfare objectives by attempting to maintain labour.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to explore DroneSim, a virtual reality (VR)-based flight training simulator, as an alternative for real-world drone-mediated building inspection training. Design/methodology/approach Construction, engineering and management students were asked to pilot drones in the VR-based DroneSim space and perform common flight operations and inspection tasks within the spatiotemporal context of a building construction project. Another student group was also recruited and asked to perform a similar building inspection task in real world. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-Task Load Index (TLX) survey was used to assess students' inflight workload demand under both Real and DroneSim conditions. Post-assessment questionnaires were also used to analyze students' feedback regarding the usability and presence of DroneSim for drone building inspection training. Findings None of the NASA-TLX task load levels under real and DroneSim conditions were highly rated by students, and both groups experienced comparable drone-building inspection training. Students perceived DroneSim positively and found the VR experience stimulating. Originality/value This study's contribution is twofold: to better understand the development stages involved in the design of a VR-based drone flight training simulator, specifically for building inspection tasks; and to improve construction students' drone operational and flight training skills by offering them the opportunity to enhance their drone navigation skills in a risk-free, repeatable yet realistic environment. Such contributions ultimately pave the way for better integration of drone-mediated building inspection training in construction education while meeting industry needs.

AB  - Changes in phytoplankton composition of the Golden Horn Estuary were investigated following remediation, through seawater transfer from the Strait of Istanbul to the estuary. Average values of Secchi depth, salinity and dissolved oxygen increased during this study when compared with a previous study. The average number of species (S) and species diversity (H ') increased and they correlated positively with Secchi depth, salinity and dissolved oxygen. There was a similar phytoplankton group composition between this and a previous study, however, the species composition differed. A total of 127 taxa consisting of diatoms (66 taxa), dinoflagellates (49 taxa) and others (12 taxa) were identified. Abundance of dinoflagellates and phytoflagellates and their relative contribution to the total phytoplankton abundance increased during this study, however, the abundance of diatoms and their relative contribution decreased notably, as compared with the previous study. There was a significant positive correlation between salinity and dinoflagellates and phytoflagellates (P < 0.01), and also between Secchi depth and dinoflagellates (P < 0.01) in the upper estuary. Additionally, salinity and Secchi depth correlated positively with species diversity (H ') and number of species (S) (P < 0.01). The increase in water transparency probably contributed to the increase in abundance of dinoflagellates and phytoflagellates. The results revealed that water transparency was one of the most important factors affecting phytoplankton composition in the study area. Changes in some environmental conditions following seawater transfer appear to have changed phytoplankton composition. As a result, phytoplankton species were confirmed as a very good indicator of changed environmental conditions.

AB  - Well-resolved lake sediment records are key to answering questions about past hydroclimate variability. These questions are particularly relevant in California (USA), where a recent drought stoked fears of water scarcity and caused significant agricultural and other economic losses in this populous state. To contextualize recent and past cycles of aridity, we utilized a Late Holocene lacustrine record from the eastern Sierra Nevada. This study presents geochemical and sedimentological data from June Lake, California to link changes in organic matter production to environmental variability over the last similar to 4600 years. The earliest part of our record is characterized by relatively high productivity and wetter conditions than the modern lake system. This interval is followed by a series of distinct and prolonged droughts from similar to 3600 to 1700 cal yr BP, an interval that includes the regionally pervasive Late Holocene Dry Period that is recorded in June Lake as enhanced carbonate precipitation and lower primary production. The interval from similar to 1700 to 130 cal yr BP, encompassing both the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age, is characterized by less-frequent droughts and generally high production in a wetter climate. In contrast, sediments of the past 130 years record an abrupt shift to drier conditions, indicated by marked declines in nearly all production indicators. This divergence is likely influenced by anthropogenic warming and suggests that the modern lake system is anomalous with respect to the longer record of change in the basin. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Crambe abyssinica is a non-food crop referenced in the literature as having high potential for renewable energy production. A comprehensive study regarding cultivation of Crambe was developed considering agronomic aspects (plant density, irrigation and fertilization), climatic aspects (weather conditions) and environmental impacts (life cycle assessment). This is probably the first study carried out with this specie in Portugal aiming to evaluate its adaptability and the potential impacts caused by its cultivation. Crambe was cultivated during four growing seasons using seeds of FMS Brilhante cultivar with a germination rate of 84%. The seeds yields were 742 kg ha(-1); 119 kg ha(-1) and 95 kg ha(-1) for the first, second and third growing seasons, respectively, lower than that reported in Brazilian studies (989-1347 kg.ha(-1)). The fourth growing season did not produce seeds due to prevalence of cold weather. The seeds oil content varied between around 26% and 34%. The first growing season showed the best growing cycle, the results evidencing that weather conditions, namely temperature and soil's moisture, possibly influence not only seeds yield but also oil yield. Mild temperatures until flowering and high water availability allowed achieving good emergence rates on shorter periods (between 19-43 days). Life cycle assessment performed according ISO 14040:2006 showed that the impacts related to Crambe cultivation in extensive farming mode (with organic fertilization and small inputs of labor) are mainly related to the consumption of diesel and electricity used in the preparation of field for sowing and its irrigation. Overall, Crambe cultivation showed lower impact for climate change than that verified for others systems in extensive mode.

AB  - The patterns of Holocene moisture variability inferred from different proxies remain controversial in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (NETP), which impedes our understanding of the behavior and dynamics of the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM). Here we present two pH records spanning the last similar to 12 kyr from well-dated loess-paleosol sections (YWY14 and SHD09) from the NETP. Based on the modified cyclization ratio index (CBT') of the branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) and regional CBT'-pH empirical relationship, the reconstructed pH values from topmost samples are consistent with the instrumental pH values of the surrounding surface soil. Our results illustrate generally similar pH trends from two loess sections characterized by alkaline conditions from 12.0 to 8.5 cal kyr BP, neutral or acidic during the mid-Holocene and alkaline conditions again during the late Holocene. The intervals of lowest CBT'-derived pH values during the mid-Holocene in our records correlate with those of highest tree pollen percentage from adjacent lake sediments and the regionally weakest aeolian activity from records of paleosol development synthesized from the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) in northern China, suggesting a moisture maximum during that period. Taken together, we conclude that CBT'-derived pH variability can be potentially used as an indicator of EASM evolution and the wettest climate occurred during the mid-Holocene in the NETP. The changes in summer precipitation during the Holocene on the NETP can be attributed to the interaction between the mid-latitude westerlies and the EASM circulation.

AB  - Grazing of farm woodlots in the upper Midwest is generally thought to degrade timber value and damage soil health. Nonetheless, Wisconsin property tax law creates an incentive for this practice. Therefore, this project sought to determine the effects of cattle grazing on vegetation and soil conditions in woodlands under different grazing management. We compared eleven grazed woodlots under various livestock management regimes with five woodlots that have not been grazed for at least 30 years in the Kickapoo Watershed in Crawford County, WI. We conducted vegetation surveys in all the woodlands and measured soil properties in a subset. We talked to farmers about their cattle management practices and beliefs about farm woodlots. Grazed woodlands had higher frequencies of introduced shrubs, less litter depth, fewer seedlings and saplings, more grass cover, and higher soil bulk density compared with un-grazed woodlands. Grazing negatively impacted regeneration and condition of seedlings, saplings, and saplings of commercial value. In grazed woods, we noted a relation between the cattle stocking rate and edaphic variables including amount of bare soil, litter depth, and canopy cover, and a difference between dairy and beef cattle in shrub density. We validated a set of simple indicators and metrics for on-going comparison of grazed and un-grazed farm woodlots in this area. Introduced shrub species was the clearest indicator of change, followed by litter depth, regeneration status of trees, and soil bulk density. The study points to potential opportunities for silvopasture techniques that could mitigate vegetation and soil degradation such as careful management of livestock stocking rate and timing of grazing.

AB  - Carbon isotope compositions of land snail shells (delta C-13(shell)) are shown to be indicative of local climate conditions. However, it is largely unknown how the responses of delta C-13(shell) to climatic factors changes amongst different species. In this study, we collected 3 species of land snail shells across the East Asian monsoon region of China to explore the overall relationship between delta C-13(shell) as well as the response of individual species to the regional climate. Results show that, whereas all species collectively can provide a consensus relation between delta C-13(shell) and local climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation; the response of individual species to the fluctuations of these factors is not uniform. Specifically, while the southerly species Bradybaena similaris exhibits robust delta C-13(shell)-mean precipitation correlation in both linearity and sensitivity, a common northerly species, Cathaica fasciola, only finds limited utility as a climate indicator, particularly for precipitation. Meanwhile, the south-central species Acusta ravida appears to be able to faithfully record past climate conditions despite showing a wider distribution and a broader habitat. Such species-dependent nature in the relations between delta C-13(shell) and local climatic factors can be attributed to the effect of ingested carbonate and variations in eco-physiological factors of different species, and is expected to be widespread, suggesting the need to be taken into consideration for future studies.

AB  - Effluents from textile industries are highly colored due to vast use of various azo dyes and color is the first visual indicator of pollution. Biological treatment of textile effluent is often hampered due to the alkaline pH and high salinity; a common characteristic of many textile industrial wastewaters. Considering this, the present study explores the potential of a newly isolated halotolerant and alkaliphilic bacterium Nesterenkonia lacusekhoensis EMLA3 for degradation of methyl red (MR) dye under alkaline condition. Strain EMLA3 showed 97% degradation of 50 mg L-1 MR after 16 h at initial pH of 11.5 in nutrient medium. Dye degradation by the isolate is supported by the formation of low-molecular weight metabolites as divulge through GC-MS & FTIR studies Optimum dye degradation was observed in the pH range of 8.0-11.5 and temperature range of 30-35 degrees C. Significant MR degrading activity of the strain could be achieved in the presence of very high salt level (100-120 g L-1 NaCl) and in co-presence of different heavy metals. Application of strain to alkaline pH, salt, and heavy metals laden-textile effluent resulted in overall 83% dye removal from the effluent after 120 h of treatment under static condition. Furthermore, the property of microbe to drop-down the pH of wastewater from 11.5 to 8.60 after treatment also lowers the need of additional neutralization treatment. The entire study thus comes out with novel application of N. lacusekhoensis-a less explored extremophilic bacterium-for treatment of alkaline and salt-rich azo dye-containing wastewaters.

AB  - Recently, there has been a renewed interest and an increase in published research on equine grazing and pasture management. The objectives of this paper are to review equine grazing research methodologies with an aim to encourage standardized research procedures. This review highlights standard methods used in equine pasture-related research, including use of climate data and soil type; seed bed preparation and grazing management; determining forage nutritive value; defining forage maturity; tracking horse health parameters; evaluating different grazing systems; and future technologies. This review covers in-depth discussions on determining forage biomass yield, forage populations, ground cover, persistence, forage intake, and grazing behavior. Specifically, mechanical harvesting, hand clipping, rising plate meter, and falling plate meter are all methods used to determine forage biomass yield. Frequency grid, point sampling, visual assessment, Natural Resources Conservation Service pasture condition score, and the double Dominant, Abundant, Frequent, Occasional, Rare (DAFOR) scale can be used to track forage populations, ground cover, and persistence of pasture species. Three primary methods have been used when estimating horse forage intake including the difference between pre- and postgrazing herbage mass, the difference in pre- and postgrazing bodyweight, and use of digestibility and fecal output markers. Equine grazing behavior has been described by investigating preference, pre- and post-sward height, and bite and mastication rate. Awareness of key methodologies should encourage movement toward research protocol standardization that will allow for scientific comparisons and application of pasture-related research results across the horse industry.

AB  - A simple, rapid, highly accurate and sensitive kinetic method is proposed for determining chromium(VI). The method is based on its catalytic effect on the oxidation of Celestine blue (CB+) by H2O2 in the presence of 2,2'-bipyridyl (Bipyr) and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) at pH 6.50. The reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance of indicator dye at 645 nm. The analytical variables, which have influences on the sensitivity, were investigated and the optimum conditions were established. The optimized conditions made it possible to determine and speciate chromium in a linear range of 5-200 mu g L-1 with a detection limit of 0.65 mu g L-1. The recoveries and relative standard deviations (RSDs) for the determination of 10, 25, 75 and 150 mu g L-1 Cr(VI) (n: 5) were in the range of 99.0-99.8% and 0.2-3.5%, respectively. The selectivity was also studied and greatly enhanced by adding a suitable masking mixture. The method was successfully applied to the simultaneous analysis of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in natural water and waste water samples with a recovery changing in the range of 95-103% for Cr(III) and 100-104% for Cr(VI). Its accuracy was validated by the analysis of certified reference materials with good agreement between certified and found values.

AB  - Paleosols preserved between flows of the Columbia River Basalt Province record hiatuses in basalt emplacement and provide detailed information about paleoclimatic and pedogenic conditions during pedogenesis. The relatively long duration of pedogenesis (10(4) to >10(6) yr) for these paleosols makes them unlikely to have been influenced by short-duration climate fluctuations and allows them to accurately reflect long-term climate trends related to global climate change. Ten paleosols hosted by the Grande Ronde and Wanapum Formations of the Columbia River Basalts were identified on the basis of pedogenic features such as horizon development, root traces, and saprolitization, and they were studied as paleoclimatic indicators. Relationships between the ages of the paleosols and their clay-mineral compositions suggest that pedogenic processes changed in the eastern Columbia River Basalt Province at ca. 15.8 Ma. Analyses of mass-balance trends and chemical alteration in a ca. 16.0 Ma paleosol indicate that it formed under warm, humid climate conditions. We suggest that the absence of similar warm, humid paleosols and the presence of 2: 1 clay-rich paleosols that formed after ca. 15.8 Ma represent a cooling and drying climate change related to the termination of the middle Miocene climate optimum, a development not previously captured in paleosol studies. In addition, the well-constrained dates of the basalts provide better resolution on the timing of this termination. When combined with other middle Miocene paleoclimate estimates from the Columbia River Basalt Province, our results suggest a geographic control on mean annual precipitation in the middle Miocene Columbia River Basalt Province leading to an increasing-to-the-east precipitation gradient.

AB  - Accuracy of paleovegetation reconstruction and understanding of phytolith formation would both be improved by further study of phytolith size in the Phragmites australis under different environmental conditions. Leaves of P. australis were collected from 11 sampling sites in northeast China with differences in temperature, precipitation and habitat. Principal component analysis of environmental factors (climatic and edaphic) indicated that the annual averages of temperature and precipitation were the main factors influencing phytolith size. Moreover, three-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) further showed that phytolith size differed significantly under conditions of different temperature or precipitation gradients, whereas habitat differences had little effect. The changes in phytolith size with temperature differed in the humid, semi-humid and semi-arid areas of northeast China. In the humid and semi-humid areas, moving from the temperate to the warm temperate zone, increasing temperature reduced phytolith size; whereas in the semi-arid area, phytolith became larger with increasing temperature. In the warm temperate and temperate zones, the changes of phytolith size with precipitation showed the same trend moving from the semi-arid to semi-humid to humid areas, as precipitation increased, phytolith grew larger. Finally, ANOVA revealed that phytoliths were also sensitive to habitat. These findings demonstrated that the size of P. australis phytoliths was sensitive to environmental factors: for regional research, the annual averages of temperature and precipitation were the major factors influencing size, but in the same climate district, habitat differences seemed to also have a significant impact on phytolith size.

AB  - To determine the potential release of heavy metals from municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWI-FA), the leaching behaviors of MSWI-FA from Likeng waste incineration power plant in China were characterized according to the US EPA method 1314. Heavy metals (i.e. Pb, Cr, Cd, Cu and Zn) leaching characteristics were investigated over a wide range of liquid-tosolid ratios (L/S 0.2-10 mL/g-dry) and different pH conditions (2, 4 and 6). The test results revealed that eluent with high pH of about 12 increased a little with increase of influent solutions pH. Similar concentration patterns of a heavy metal were observed at different pH influent solutions, and different concentration patterns for different heavy metals were showed at different liquid-to-solid ratio (L/S) range. Cumulative maximum release of heavy metals followed the pattern of Cr > Pb > Cu > Cd > Zn. The release of Pb and Cd decreased with pH of influent solutions while Cu and Zn changed oppositely. However, concentration of Cr did not significantly change and cumulative release linearly increased with L/S due to the leaching process was controlled by solubility. The effect of L/S ratio on Pb, Cd and Cu release in MSWI-FA indicated the prevalence of the dominant mechanism was either solubility or diffusion controlled. Zn extract concentrations were observed to decrease initially with L/S increase to 5 followed by a slight increase due to the presence of soluble zinc compounds in strong basic conditions.

AB  - Many urban areas lack in quality of urban condition, thus affecting the quality of life of urban dwellers. Great efforts are made to develop new strategies for transforming existing urban patterns toward higher quality, which is related to sodo-economic, environmental, transportation, and other factors. The analysis of possible transformations further requires considering their effects at a parcel scale up to the city region. This is important, because gaining in one quality at a local scale, e.g., housing supply, comes partly at the expense of other qualities, such as the availability of open space, affecting recreation amenities at a regional scale. However, an approach for the assessment of the urban condition's quality across multiple aspects and scales is not yet available. We demonstrate an indicator-based behavioral modeling approach, which illustrates interactions and effects on and between different spatial scales. An urban development scenario was compared to the status quo to show the effects on different quality aspects. A set of indicators was calculated from the modeling results and mapped for the regional, district, and local scale. The cross-scale analysis of the selected indicators effectively points to areas where densification patterns cause, e.g., loss in their recreational quality and, thus, potentially a degradation of the quality of life of urban dwellers. The presented approach helps understanding the relationships between political interventions, urban patterns, and their impact on urban quality. The spatially explicit visualization of possible effects may support matching different spatial development policy objectives across the divergent targets of regional planning participants.

AB  - In this study, the mRNA levels of the Nrt2 nitrate transporter gene were used as a molecular indicator of nitrogen status in two dominant diatom groups, Skeletonema and Chaetoceros, which inhabit the southern East China Sea (ECS). To accurately interpret the abundance of Nrt2 transcripts insitu, maximum and minimum expression levels were determined under conditions of nitrogen deprivation and ammonium addition, respectively. In August 2010, Nrt2 transcript levels in Skeletonema at the inner shelf region exhibited a mean of 111mmole/(mole EFL); at the mid-shelf region, the mean Nrt2 mRNA levels were 298mmole/(mole EFL), which was very close to the maximum levels observed under nitrogen starvation. By contrast, the Nrt2 transcript levels in Chaetoceros were low at all of the shelf locations, except at one station in the mid-shelf region. The cross-shelf mean was 2.86mmole/(mole EFL), which was similar to the expression levels observed in cultured Chaetoceros under conditions of sufficient ammonium. Similar expression patterns were observed in diatoms in the southern ECS in June 2011, but the Nrt2 transcript levels in Skeletonema at the inner shelf region were reduced to a mean of 28.6mmole/(mole EFL). Regression analysis indicated that cell abundance and Nrt2 expression were closely related to the nutricline depth in the coastward half of the southern ECS for Skeletonema but not for Chaetoceros. These results indicate that the evaluated species differ in nitrogen status, which may reflect their evolutionary strategies to survive in a fluctuating marine environment.

AB  - Restoration and protection of urban stream ecosystems require knowledge of the primary causes of their degradation. Conventional stormwater drainage has been identified as a primary source of stress to streams, but it remains unclear if the proximal stressor to stream biota can be represented by flow regime alone or requires a metric integrating the range of stressors associated with stormwater runoff or with urban land use more generally. We used the information-theoretic approach to assess whether various hydrologic indicators better predicted SIGNAL (a biotic index using macroinvertebrate families) than did attenuated imperviousness (AI; a landscape measure of connected imperviousness that inversely weights impervious areas by their distance from the nearest stormwater drain or stream) or total imperviousness (TI). The best models using hydrologic indicators were much less plausible than the overall best model, which used only AI. Predictors in the best hydrologic models characterized the magnitude of low-flow antecedent events, overall flow variability, and antecedent flow flashiness. TI was a poorer predictor than AI, but similarly plausible as some hydrologic models. The results suggest that although there are components of the flow regime that degrade stream ecosystems, AI is a better predictor because it integrates hydrologic and other stormwater-driven stressors, such as changes to water quality. Management of stream condition in our study area should focus on addressing conventional stormwater drainage and its associated alterations to hydrology and water quality. The identification of a single metric provides useful insights for others trying to identify simple predictors of complex phenomena. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Studies of spatial and temporal changes in modern and past sea-ice occurrence may help to understand the processes controlling the recent decrease in Arctic sea-ice cover. Here, we determined concentrations of IP25, a novel biomarker proxy for sea ice developed in recent years, phytoplankton-derived biomarkers (brassicasterol and dinosterol) and terrigenous biomarkers (campesterol and beta-sitosterol) in the surface sediments from the Kara and Laptev seas to estimate modern spatial (seasonal) sea-ice variability and organic-matter sources. C-25-HBI dienes and trienes were determined as additional palaeoenvironmental proxies in the study area. Furthermore, a combined phytoplankton-IP25 biomarker approach (PIP25 index) is used to reconstruct the modern sea-ice distribution more quantitatively. The terrigenous biomarkers reach maximum concentrations in the coastal zones and estuaries, reflecting the huge discharge by the major rivers Ob, Yenisei and Lena. Maxima in phytoplankton biomarkers indicating increased primary productivity were found in the seasonally ice-free central part of the Kara and Laptev seas. Neither IP25 nor PIP25, however, shows a clear and simple correlation with satellite sea-ice distribution in our study area due to the complex environmental conditions in our study area and the transportation process of sea-ice diatom in the water column. Differences in the diene/IP25 and triene/IP25 ratios point to different sources of these HBIs and different environmental conditions. The diene/IP25 ratio seems to correlate positively with sea-surface temperature, while negatively with salinity distributions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The growth of 67 young hybrid (Castanea x coudercii A. Camus) and pure sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) plantations was studied in relation to ground vegetation (GV) and non-site factors such as type of site preparation, weed control (WC), disease-related damage and prior land use. The classification and regression trees procedure was used to analyse the data. Ground vegetation communities accounted for a large amount of variability in the site index (SI) and were found to be useful as predictors of chestnut site quality. The presence of broom communities indicated the best site for establishing chestnut plantations, whereas bracken and bramble communities indicated poorer conditions, although those sites can still be considered suitable for growing chestnut. Terrain covered with herbaceous communities also indicated intermediate or even good site conditions. The poorest sites were the heathlands. As regards non-site factors, only weed control was found to be a significant variable. Ground vegetation caused a significant reduction in tree growth, indicating the importance of carrying out regular weeding to improve productivity. The most positive effect of weeding on height growth was detected in terrain covered by gorse and broom, and the least positive effect was observed in heathland. The findings are important for forest management purposes, as evaluation of ground vegetation will enable rapid prediction of site productivity classes in afforested areas and help in selecting the best land for planting this species in reforestation programmes.

AB  - Insufficient hygienic water quality and bathing prohibitions are still a serious problem in the Szczecin Lagoon (southern Baltic). In our study we focus on the southern lagoon coast and analyse the causes and consequences of high Escherichia coli bacteria concentrations. For this purpose we carry out laboratory experiments on the behaviour of E.coli in the lagoon, a literature review and apply a three-dimensional flow model together with a Lagrangian particle tracking routine. Three major E.coli sources, the Uecker river, the wetlands with cattle as well as sea gulls with bathing and fisheries were allocated, quantified and compiled into an emission scenario. This serves as input for transport simulations under different wind conditions and for the development of a spatial contamination map. Reasons for high E.coli concentrations in the lagoon are a permanent supply from different sources and the special environmental situation in the lagoon. The availability of organic matter, either in form of reed stems or as muddy sediments, has a positive effect on bacteria survival. Very important, too, are the prevailing wind and flow conditions, which cause water and organism transport in narrow ribbons along the coastline and promote near-shore accumulations. Even in our shallow lagoon, the application of a 3D-model is beneficial. Heavy rains are, very likely, responsible for the outstanding high total-coliform concentrations of 11,000 cfu/100 ml on August 21, 2006. The model system proved to be a valuable tool for spatial analysis and is suitable to support the development of bathing water profiles according to the EU Bathing Water Directive (2006/7/EC).

AB  - Field studies in fresh and marine waters consistently show diel fluctuations in concentrations of enterococci, indicators of water quality. We investigated sunlight inactivation of Enterococcus faecalis to gain insight into photoinactivation mechanisms and cellular responses to photostress. E. faecalis bacteria were exposed to natural sunlight in clear, filtered seawater under both oxic and anoxic conditions to test the relative importance of oxygen-mediated and non-oxygen-mediated photoinactivation mechanisms. Multiple methods were used to assess changes in bacterial concentration, including cultivation, quantitative PCR (qPCR), propidium monoazide (PMA)-qPCR, LIVE/DEAD staining using propidium iodide (PI), and cellular activity, including ATP concentrations and expression of the superoxide dismutase-encoding gene, sodA. Photoinactivation, based on numbers of cultivable cells, was faster in oxic than in anoxic microcosms exposed to sunlight, suggesting that oxygen-mediated photoinactivation dominated. There was little change in qPCR signal over the course of the experiment, demonstrating that the nucleic acid targets were not damaged to a significant extent. The PMA-qPCR signal was also fairly stable, consistent with the observation that the fraction of PI-permeable cells was constant. Thus, damage to the membrane was minimal. Microbial ATP concentrations decreased in all microcosms, particularly the sunlit oxic microcosms. The increase in relative expression of the sodA gene in the sunlit oxic microcosms suggests that cells were actively responding to oxidative stress. Dark repair was not observed. This research furthers our understanding of photoinactivation mechanisms and the conditions under which diel fluctuations in enterococci can be expected in natural and engineered systems.

AB  - We compared whisking movement patterns during acquisition of tactile detection and object discrimination under conditions in which (a) head movements are excluded and (b) exposure to tactile discriminanda is confined to the large, moveable vibrissae (macrovibrissae). We used optoelectronic instrumentation to track the movements of an individual whisker with high spatio-temporal resolution and a testing paradigm, which allowed us to dissociate performance on an "indicator" response (lever pressing) from the rat's "observing" responses (discriminative whisking). We analyzed the relation between discrimination performance and whisking movement patterns in order to clarify the process by which the indicator response comes under the stimulus control of information acquired by the rat's whisking behavior. Whisking patterns over the course of task acquisition differed with task demands. Acquisition of the Detection task was correlated with modulation of only one whisking movement parameter-total number of whisks emitted, and more whisking was seen on trials in which the discriminandum was absent. Discrimination between a sphere and cube differing in size and texture was correlated with a reduction in whisk duration and protraction amplitude and with a shift towards higher whisking frequencies. Our findings confirm previous reports that acquisition of tactile discriminations involves modulation by the animal of both the amount and the type of whisking. In contrast with a previous report (Brecht et al., 1997), they indicate that rats can solve tactile object detection and discrimination tasks (a) using only the large, motile mystacial vibrissae (macrovibrissae) and (b) without engaging in head movements. We conclude that the functional contribution of the macrovibrissae will vary with the nature of the task and the conditions of testing.

KW  - Smallanthus sonchifolius
AB  - Yacon (Smallanthus sonchifolius [Poepp.] H. Rob., Asteraceae) is an Andean plant being explored as a functional food, due to high concentrations of fructooligosaccharides (FOS), a natural sweetener capable of reducing blood lipids and glucose levels, supporting prevention of chronic diseases, such as diabetes. Yacon commercial production is still being established, thus cropping practices and their impact on profitability are yet poorly explained. Improved planting recommendations are demanded, as it affects crop yield. In this background, a field trial was conducted to determine row spacing and plant populations for yacon production in tropical highland areas. The experimental design was a randomized complete block, in a split-plot scheme, where blocks were three row spacings (0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 m) and subplots covered three spacings between plants (0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 m), with four replicates. At harvest time, evaluations on accumulation of dry mass in the plant and tuber root production data (number, weight, total productivity, and per class) were made. Profitability indicators were estimated (gross income, operational profit, and benefit-cost ratio). Data suggest productive and economic variations among tested planting configurations, as an example higher productivity (31.5 t ha(-1)) and positive benefit-cost ratio (2.51) when using 1.0 m between rows and 0.4 m between plants for the conditions tested. These results point out the prospect to select better crop management practices for yacon, cutting costs, and increasing yield. Another key find was yacon's capacity to overcome intense drought and temperature stress, not previously documented for this crop. Therefore, yacon is a new crop with potential to boost farming income through crop diversification.

AB  - The primary aim of this survey is to investigate the role of Bacillilectin in the regulation of metabolic processes in the body of animals under stress. Evidently, under stress, the processes of lipid peroxidation (LPO) are activated in the body, which affects the structure and function of cell membranes. Of particular interest is the study of changes in the content of primary and secondary products in blood erythrocytes as the main indicators of the intensity of LPO processes and as markers of the degree of endogenous intoxication. To fulfil the aim of the study, the authors have utilized LII lectin isolated from the surface of nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria Paenibacillus polymyxa 1460. The studies were carried out on healthy male white outbred rats with an average body weight of 210 g. The animals were kept under standard vivarium conditions: 12-hour illumination period, temperature 20 degrees C, food, and water ad libitum. As a result, the study demonstrates that the lectin Paenibacillus polymyxa1460 (LII) plays a significant role in the regulation of metabolic processes in the body of animals against the background of swimming stress, contributing to the normalization of lipid peroxidation processes, and also participates in the normalization of the microflora of the large intestine in conditions of dysbiosis in the body of animals against the background stress, acting as a prebiotic, which in turn is widely used for the correction and restoration of the number and qualitative composition of the intestinal microflora. Furthermore, considering the results, it can be inferred that P. polymyxa 1460 lectin LII exhibits antioxidant properties and can be successfully used as a natural antioxidant, being an effective tonic, as well as bio stimulating agent.

AB  - Invasions by dreissenid mussels and the round goby have altered the makeup of benthos in many areas of the Great Lakes complicating the use of benthic invertebrate composition as an indicator of environmental conditions. The Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) has been monitoring the composition of benthos at nearshore stations since the 1990s. The interactive influences of environmental change and invasive species have been evident in areas of the Toronto Waterfront such as Humber Bay (HB), an area of intensifying urbanization. Dreissenid mussels were first detected in HB in 1994, became abundant in 2000, and were followed by the round goby in 2005. Both invasions overlapped with increasing population density in the watershed and efforts to reduce pollutant and nutrient inputs. Benthic invertebrate diversity increased post-dreissenids, with densities of gastropods and amphipods increasing during peak mussel abundance (2000-2003). Dreissenid abundance declined after 2005, and snails (Valvatidae) disappeared, corresponding with increasing goby abundance. Abundance of sphaeriid clams declined over the monitoring period. Water clarity increased and the chlorophyll a level declined in the mid-1990s, before dreissenids were abundant at the site. Trophic conditions inferred from invertebrate composition shifted from oligotrophic in 1990 to mesotrophic and back to oligotrophic in 2012. There was little change in sediment quality other than a subtle increase in clay and fine silt at the primarily silty site. The trajectory of changes in the benthos was more strongly correlated with the dreissenid and goby invasions than changes in environmental quality.

AB  - Environmental factors play vital roles in successful plantation and cultivation of tree seedlings. This study focuses on problems associated with reforestation under extreme continental climatic conditions. The objectives were to assess relative seedling performance (survival and growth) with respect to plantation age, and to analyze the influence of specific climatic factors during the early stages of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) plantations. The study was carried out in reforested areas of the Tujyin Nars region of northern Mongolia on six Scots pine plantations ranging from 5 to 10 years. In each of the six plantations, five 900 m(2) permanent sample plots were established and survival rates and growth performance measured annually over 7 years. Results show high variation in survival among the plantations (p < 0.001, F = 29.7). Seedling survival in the first year corresponded directly to the number of dry days in May. However, survival rate appeared to stabilize after the second year. The insignificant variation of height categories throughout the observation period indicated low competition among individuals. Two linear mixed-effect models show that height and radial growth were best explained by relative air humidity, which we consider to be a reliable indicator of site-specific water availability. Insufficient amounts and uneven distribution of rainfall pose a major threat during the first year of plantation establishment. Humidity and water availability are decisive factors for a successful seedling plantation. This highlights the impact of drought on forest plantations in northern Mongolia and the importance of developing climate resilient reforestation strategies.

AB  - Bovine metabolic diseases are silent clinical conditions caused by a disturbance in normal cellular metabolic processes majorly due to the demand for nutrients, physiological stress and inflammation in lactating animals. Even though these are non-devastating diseases, conditions like mastitis and ketosis highly influence cow's lactation and fertility performance that leads to economic losses. Hence, in the present study, a combined detection including a sensitive paper-based colorimetric device for the rapid determination of somatic cells (SCC) and electrochemical detection beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in the milk samples has been developed. The working range was 1 x 10(5) to 2 x 10(6) for SCC and 0.05 to 2.5 mM BHB in which the normal and extreme cases of mastitis and ketosis values exist. The detection method is based on reaction using substrate 5-Bromo-indoxyl acetate (5BIA) and enzyme (BHB dehydrogenase) for the enzymes (esterase) and substrate (BHB) present in the milk samples during mastitis and ketosis respectively. An increase in blue color development was associated with an increase in the number of SCC; likewise, the increased voltage denoted the increase concentration of BHB in the samples. The repeatability was evaluated, and the % relative standard deviation (RSD) value < 8.0 (n = 12). The limit of detection (LOD) was close to that achieved by a desktop spectrophotometer. The applicability of the developed kit demonstrated good sensitivity that can be deployed for other biological samples of interest. The proposed method provides a rapid, sensitive and promising tool for the regular monitoring of cows as a point of care tests (POC) at the field level.

AB  - In order to save resources, honey bee (Apis rnellifera) colonies in the temperate zones stop brood rearing during winter. Brood rearing is resumed in late winter to build up a sufficient worker force that allows to exploit floral resources in upcoming spring. The timing of brood onset in hibernating colonies is crucial and a premature brood onset could lead to an early depletion of energy reservoirs. However, the mechanisms underlying the timing of brood onset and potential risks of mistiming in the course of ongoing climate change are not well understood. To assess the relative importance of ambient temperature and photoperiod as potential regulating factors for brood rearing activity in hibernating colonies, we overwintered 24 honey bee colonies within environmental chambers The colonies were assigned to two different temperature treatments and three different photoperiod treatments to disentangle the individual and interacting effects of temperature and photoperiod. Tracking in-hive temperature as indicator for brood rearing activity revealed that increasing ambient temperature triggered brood onset. Under cold conditions, photoperiod alone did not affect brood onset, but the light regime altered the impact of higher ambient temperature on brood rearing activity. Further the number of brood rearing colonies increased with elapsed time which suggests the involvement of an internal clock. We conclude that timing of brood onset in late winter is mainly driven by temperature but modulated by photoperiod. Climate warming might change the interplay of these factors and result in mismatches of brood phenology and environmental conditions.

AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere have increased significantly over the past century. Many methods have been devised to reduce CO2 industrial emissions, e.g., CO2 postcombustion absorption by amine-based solvents. Solvent degradation losses are very critical in this process, due to economic and environmental issues. The two main degradation pathways of amine-based aqueous solutions in the presence of CO2 are oxidative and thermal degradation. In this work, a lab-scale pilot plant has been set up to carry out degradation experiments during continuous and dynamic cycles of absorption and stripping with three different amine solvents: MEA (monoethanolamine) used as benchmark solvent for CO2 capture, a blend of 1MPZ (1-methylpiperazine) and PZ (piperazine), and a blend of MDEA (methyldiethanolamine) and MEA. The experimental data have been used to assess the performance of CO2 absorption over time and experimental conditions. The variation of CO2 fraction at the gas outlet of the reactor has been used as an indicator of solvent degradation. To simulate the behavior of the plant at different experimental conditions and with each solvent, a dynamic model has been developed, on the basis of the validation of a fast reaction regime. It reproduces accurately the pilot plant's behavior during the absorption and stripping phases. Among the solvents' physical properties, the effect of viscosity appears to be the most critical for the CO(2 )absorption efficiency. Kinetics of solvent degradation has finally been optimized to match experimental observations. Of the three solvents studied, 1MPZ/PZ is the most stable, whereas MEA and MDEA/MEA have quite similar degradation rates.

AB  - Neonicotinoids are the most prominent group of insecticides in the world and are commercialized in over 120 countries for the control of agricultural pests mainly due to their broad-spectrum activity and versatility in application. Though non-target soil organisms are likely to be exposed during application, there is paucity of information in scientific literature regarding their sensitivity to neonicotinoids. This study attempts to fill this gap by evaluating, under laboratory conditions, the chronic toxicity of the neonicotinoids thiacloprid and acetamiprid, through their commercial formulations (CF), to the soil invertebrates Folsomia candida, Eisenia andrei and Enchytraeus crypticus. Results obtained indicate that the relative reproductive sensitivity of the test organisms can be expressed as: R candida = E. andrei > E. crypticus (for acetamiprid CF) and E. andrei > R candida > E. crypticus (for thiacloprid CF). To extrapolate from laboratory test results to field conditions, predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) and predicted no-effect concentrations were derived. Calculated toxicity-exposure ratios (TER = EC10/PEC) were below trigger values for acetamiprid and thiacloprid, when estimated with initial PEC. While estimated hazard quotients (HQ = PEC/PNEC), were greater than the European Commission trigger value. Therefore, with the current data under standard environmental risk assessment schemes it can be considered that the risk of thiacloprid and acetamiprid to the soil compartment is unacceptable. However, further research into the effects of these substances on different organisms is required to increase the confidence in the risk assessment estimates for instance, by calculating hazardous concentrations using species sensitivity distribution curves.

AB  - Extremes in seasonal environmental conditions can significantly impact the health and physiological functioning of reef corals, underscoring the need for knowledge of seasonally specific baselines from which to monitor and forecast impending stress. Increases above summertime means in seawater temperature, sunlight intensity, turbidity, or sedimentation may reduce coral immunocompetency and increase disease and bleaching susceptibility. We analyzed temporal patterns in innate immunity parameters over nine time points throughout one year to establish baseline levels from which anomalies might be detected for representative species from three major reef-building coral families (Acroporidae, Faviidae, and Poritidae). Temporal patterns in both phenoloxidase activity and expression of green fluorescent protein-like proteins varied among the three families, as did overall constitutive levels. For example, Porites cylindrica had 2.8-fold higher yearly average levels of phenoloxidase activity than Acropora millepora, which had the lowest levels. In contrast, mean fluorescence was lowest in Acropora millepora and highest in Echinopora mammiformis. Relationships between the potential physical drivers (seasonal variation in seawater temperature, rainfall, salinity) and temporal patterns in these parameters also differed among the three species. For example, phenoloxidase activity was positively correlated with seawater temperature in A. millepora, but negatively correlated in both E. mammiformis and P. cylin-drica. Distinctions in constitutive levels and temporal patterns in these parameters among species suggest that corals from these three families have evolved different strategies for investing resources into innate immune parameters. Such differences highlight the need for species-specific baselines and long-term assessments to accurately predict coral reef trajectories in rapidly changing environments.

AB  - 1. Spatial distribution models (SDMs) have been useful for improving management of species of concern in many areas. This study was designed to model the spatial distribution of bottlenose dolphins among seasons of the year in the Mississippi Sound within the northern Gulf of Mexico. 2. Models were constructed by integrating presence locations of dolphins acquired fromline-transect sampling from 2011-2013 with maps of environmental conditions for the region to generate a likelihood of dolphin occurrence for winter (January-March), spring (April-June), summer (July-September), and autumn (October-December) using maximum entropy. 3. Models were successfully generated using the program MaxEnt and had high predictive capacity for all seasons (AUC (area under curve) > 0.8). Distinct seasonal shifts in spatial distribution were evident including increased predicted occurrence in deepwater habitats during the winter, limited predicted occurrence in the western Mississippi Sound in winter and spring, widespread predicted occurrence over the entire region during summer, and a distinct westward shift of predicted occurrence in autumn. 4. The most important environmental predictors used in SDMs were distance to shore, salinity, and nitrates, but variable importance differed considerably among seasons. 5. Geographic shifts in predicted occurrence probably reflect both direct effects of changing environmental conditions and subsequent changes in prey availability and foraging efficiency. 6. Overall, seasonal models helped to identify preferred habitats for dolphins among seasons of the year and can be used to inform management of this protected species in the northern Gulf of Mexico.

AB  - Round brown spiny cysts constitute a morphological group common in high latitude dinoflagellate cyst assemblages. The dinoflagellate cyst Islandinium minutum (Harland et Reid) Head, Harland et Matthiessen is the main paleoecological indicator of seasonal sea-ice cover in the Arctic. Despite the importance of this cyst in paleoceanographical studies, its biological affinity has so far been unknown. The biological affinity of the species I.minutum and its phylogenetic position based on the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA) and the large subunit ribosomal RNA gene (LSU rDNA) were established from cyst incubation experiments in controlled conditions, optical and scanning electron microscopy, and single-cell PCR. The thecal motile cell obtained was undescribed. Although the motile cell was similar to Archaeperidinium minutum (Kofoid) Jorgensen, the motile cell of I.minutum lacked a transitional plate in the cingular series, which is present in Archaeperidinium spp. Islandinium minutum and Archaeperidinium spp. were paraphyletic in all phylogenetic analyses. Furthermore, Protoperidinium tricingulatum, which also lacks a transitional plate, was closely related to I.minutum and transfered to the genus Islandinium. Based on available data, it is clear that Islandinium is distinct from Archaeperidinium. Therefore, we considered Islandinium Head, Harland et Matthiessen as a non-fossil genus and emend its description, as well as the species I.minutum. This is the first description of a cyst-theca relationship and the first study that reports molecular data based on SSU rDNA and LSU rDNA on a species assigned to the genus Islandinium.

AB  - Regional and global chemical transport models underpredict NOx (NO + NO2) in the upper troposphere where it is a precursor to the greenhouse gas ozone. The NOx bias has been shown in model evaluations using aircraft data (Singh et al., 2007) and total column NO2 (molecules cm(-2)) from satellite observations (Napelenok et al., 2008). The causes of NOx underpredictions have yet to be fully understood due to the interconnected nature of simulated emission, transport, and chemistry processes. Recent observation-based studies, in the upper troposphere, identify chemical rate coefficients as a potential source of error (Olson et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008). Since typical chemistry evaluation techniques are not available for upper tropospheric conditions, this study develops an evaluation platform from in situ observations, stochastic convection, and deterministic chemistry. We derive a stochastic convection model and optimize it using two simulated datasets of time since convection, one based on meteorology, and the other on chemistry. The chemistry surrogate for time since convection is calculated using seven different chemical mechanisms, all of which predict shorter time since convection than our meteorological analysis. We evaluate chemical simulations by inter-comparison and by pairing results with observations based on NOx:HNO3, a photochemical aging indicator. Inter-comparison reveals individual chemical mechanism biases and recommended updates. Evaluation against observations shows that all chemical mechanisms overpredict NOx removal relative to long-lived methanol and carbon monoxide. All chemical mechanisms underpredict observed NOx by at least 30%, and further evaluation is necessary to refine simulation sensitivities to initial conditions and chemical rate uncertainties.

AB  - Question
   Which management treatments are suitable to replace historically applied grazing regimes? How and why does vegetation structure change following changes in management?
   Location
   Semi-natural calcareous dry grasslands in southwest Germany.
   Methods
   We analysed changes in floristic and functional composition induced by different management treatments (grazing, mowing, mulching, succession) in long-term experimental sites. First, floristic and functional distances between the initial conditions and the following years were determined. Second, we used RLQ analyses to include data on abiotic conditions, vegetation composition and functional traits in one common analysis. Finally, we applied cluster analyses on RLQ species scores to deduce functional groups.
   Results
   In contrast to the historical management regime of grazing, all alternative management treatments led to changes in floristic and functional composition, depending on their intensity with respect to biomass removal. The distance analyses showed that mulching twice per year and mowing did not lead to strong changes in floristic or functional composition. However, RLQ analysis clearly provided evidence that only the grazed sites are in equilibrium, indicating that vegetation change still goes ahead.
   Conclusions
   The current study clearly shows that RLQ is a powerful tool to elucidate ongoing processes that may remain hidden when separately analysing floristic and functional data. Alternative management treatments are not appropriate to sustain the typical disturbance dynamics of species-rich semi-natural grasslands. The less frequent an alternative management treatment is with respect to biomass removal, the less the floristic and functional structure can be maintained.

AB  - Solid-state thermal convection. as a model for the internal dynamics of planetary mantles, is generated both by volumetric heating and heating from below. A series of 2D and 3D numerical experiments is described where a bottom heat flux is prescribed as well as a constant fraction of volumetric heating with either free-slip or no-slip conditions for the two horizontal boundaries. The assumption that hot plumes rising in the interior of the layer act as a volumetric heat source leads to a first order scaling of thermal boundary layers. Cases with a no-slip boundary agree well with this scaling while cases with free-slip systematically deviate: a decrease of 20-30% is observed for the temperature difference across the boundary layer when the fraction of heating from below is increased from 0 to 1. These differences are attributable to a velocity structure near the boundary varying with the fraction of volumetric heating. The main planetary implications are that (i) the average thermal structure of the bulk mantle and lithosphere are not good indicators of the distribution of heat sources between the interior (e.g. radioactive heating, secular cooling) and the lower interface (e.g. core cooling); (ii) in contrast, the nature of volcanism (whether it is localized, hot spot like or widespread) reflect this distribution and should thus help to constrain the global thermal structure as well as the existence of a magnetic dynamo.

AB  - Age-specific body mass and % lactation are indices commonly used to monitor status of cervid populations relative to carrying capacity. However, prior-year body condition and reproductive status may influence these indices and alter their interpretation. We examined variation in body mass and % lactation among cohorts of female white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus to determine: 1) patterns of variation among age classes, 2) if cohorts compensated in subsequent years for restricted somatic development, and 3) the relationship between body mass and % lactation within cohorts. Body mass and % lactation of young deer were more variable than for older deer, potentially making them a more sensitive indicator of population status relative to carrying capacity. The lack of correlation in body mass of cohorts across years implies that cohorts can compensate for restricted somatic development during subsequent years in the environments we studied. Body mass and % lactation were positively correlated in 1.5-year cohorts, suggesting that age of primiparity was affected by body condition. However, mean cohort body mass did not influence % lactation in older cohorts. Our data support that older cohorts (>= 3 years old) have greater resiliency to changes in density or to environmental events as these cohorts demonstrated less annual variation in body mass and % lactation than did younger cohorts. Annual changes in morphometrics and fecundity of younger-aged cohorts may be the best indicator of animal density relative to carrying capacity, or of environmental events that influence carrying capacity.

AB  - Transplasmalemma electron transport induced by the impermeable electron accepters, Na-3[Fe(CN)(6)], K-3[Fe(CN)(6)], K-2[IrCl6] and K-2[IrBr6], was investigated by means of microelectrode technique, pH-stat and colorimetric experiments using the waterweed, Egeria densa. No fix stoichiometry between protons and electrons exported was observed during acceptor reduction. The H+/e(-) ratio changed during the experiments with time and depended on a number of factors such as light conditions, preincubation and incubation medium. Application of ion channel blockers (BaCl2, tetraethylammonium, charybdotoxin), inhibitors (erythrosin B, NaCN+salicylhydroxamic acid) and stimulators of proton transport (ethanol, fusicoccin) showed that ions including protons are transported in order to compensate for the electron acceptor-induced charge imbalance.
   Electrically, acceptor reduction was accompanied by depolarisation of the plasmalemma at acid and neutral pH. Both, reduction and depolarisation displayed saturation kinetics under these conditions. Surprisingly, the depolarisation disappeared at alkaline pH, whereas the acceptor reduction continued. A different mechanism of charge compensation is proposed.
   The natural electron acceptor, nitrate, did not competitively inhibit ferricyanide reduction, by contrast, it enhanced the reduction rate. Furthermore, in the presence of nitrate no nitrite was produced in the medium. Nitrate did not depolarise the plasmalemma notwithstanding the required charge compensation. Nitrate uptake is accompanied by alkalinization of the medium and acidification of the cytosol. Hence, nitrate is not a substrate of the plasmalemma redox system and it is taken up by an apparent 1:1 H+/NO3- cotransport.
   The results demonstrate that the plasmalemma redox system of Egeria leaf cells is neither a proton pump nor a nitrate carrier or reductase.

AB  - Treatment of human excreta and animal manure (HEAM) is key in controlling the spread of persistent enteric pathogens, such as viruses. The extent of virus inactivation during HEAM storage and treatment appears to vary with virus genome type, although the reasons for this variability are not clear. Here, we investigated the inactivation of viruses of different genome types under conditions representative of HEAM storage or mesophilic digestion. The goals were to characterize the influence of HEAM solution conditions on inactivation and to determine the potential mechanisms involved. Specifically, eight viruses representing the four viral genome types (single-stranded RNA [ssRNA], double-stranded RNA [dsRNA], single-stranded DNA [ssDNA], and double-stranded DNA [dsDNA]) were exposed to synthetic solutions with well-controlled temperature (20 to 35 degrees C), pH (8 to 9), and ammonia (NH3) concentrations (0 to 40 mmol liter(-1)). DNA and dsRNA viruses were considerably more resistant than ssRNA viruses, resulting in up to 1,000-fold-longer treatment times to reach a 4-log inactivation. The apparently slower inactivation of DNA viruses was rationalized by the higher stability of DNA than that of ssRNA in HEAM. Pushing the system toward harsher pH (>9) and temperature (>35 degrees C) conditions, such as those encountered in thermophilic digestion and alkaline treatments, led to more consistent inactivation kinetics among ssRNA and other viruses. This suggests that the dependence of inactivation on genome type disappeared in favor of protein-mediated inactivation mechanisms common to all viruses. Finally, we recommend the use of MS2 as a conservative indicator to assess the inactivation of ssRNA viruses and the stable Phi X174 or dsDNA phages as indicators for persistent viruses.
   IMPORTANCE
   Viruses are among the most environmentally persistent pathogens. They can be present in high concentrations in human excreta and animal manure (HEAM). Therefore, appropriate treatment of HEAM is important prior to its reuse or discharge into the environment. Here, we investigated the factors that determine the persistence of viruses in HEAM, and we determined the main mechanisms that lead to their inactivation. Unlike other organisms, viruses can have four different genome types (double- or single-stranded RNA or DNA), and the viruses studied herein represent all four types. Genome type appeared to be the major determinant for persistence. Single-stranded RNA viruses are the most labile, because this genome type is susceptible to degradation in HEAM. In contrast, the other genome types are more stable; therefore, inactivation is slower and mainly driven by the degradation of viral proteins. Overall, this study allows us to better understand the behavior of viruses in HEAM.

AB  - Total organic carbon, total inorganic carbon, biogenic silica content and total organic carbon/total nitrogen ratios of the Laguna Potrok Aike lacustrine sediment record are used to reconstruct the environmental history of south-east Patagonia during the past 51 ka in high resolution. High lake level conditions are assumed to have prevailed during the Last Glacial, as sediments are carbonate-free. Increased runoff linked to permafrost and reduced evaporation due to colder temperatures and reduced influence of Southern Hemispheric Westerlies (SHIN) may have caused these high lake levels with lake productivity being low and organic matter mainly of algal or cyanobacterial origin. Aquatic moss growth and diatom blooms occurred synchronously with southern hemispheric glacial warming events such as the Antarctic A-events, the postglacial warming following the LGM and the Younger Dryas chronozone. During these times, a combination of warmer climatic conditions with related thawing permafrost could have increased the allochthonous input of nutrients and in combination with warmer surface waters increased aquatic moss growth and diatom production. The SHW were not observed to affect southern Patagonia during the Last Glacial. The Holocene presents a completely different lacustrine system because (a) permafrost no longer inhibits infiltration nor emits meltwater pulses and (b) the positioning of the SHW over the investigated area gives rise to strong and dry winds. Under these conditions total organic carbon, total organic carbon/total nitrogen ratios and biogenic silica cease to be first order productivity indicators. On the one hand, the biogenic silica is influenced by dissolution of diatoms due to higher salinity and pH of the lake water under evaporative stress characterizing low lake levels. On the other hand, total organic carbon and total organic carbon/total nitrogen profiles are influenced by reworked macrophytes from freshly exposed lake level terraces during lowstands. Total inorganic carbon remains the most reliable proxy for climatic variations during the Holocene as high precipitation of carbonates can be linked to low lake levels and high autochthonous production. The onset of inorganic carbon precipitation has been associated with the southward shift of the SHW over the latitudes of Laguna Potrok Aike. The refined age-depth model of this record suggests that this shift occurred around 9.4 cal. ka BP. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - With improved observation methods, increased winter navigation, and increased awareness of the climate and environmental changes, research on the Baltic Sea ice conditions has become increasingly active. Sea ice has been recognized as a sensitive indicator for changes in climate. Although the inter-annual variability in the ice conditions is large, a change towards milder ice winters has been detected from the time series of the maximum annual extent of sea ice and the length of the ice season. On the basis of the ice extent, the shift towards a warmer climate took place in the latter half of the 19th century. On the other hand, data on the ice thickness, which are mostly limited to the land-fast ice zone, basically do not show clear trends during the 20th century, except that during the last 20 years the thickness of land-fast ice has decreased. Due to difficulties in measuring the pack-ice thickness, the total mass of sea ice in the Baltic Sea is, however, still poorly known. The ice extent and length of the ice season depend on the indices of the Arctic Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation. Sea ice dynamics, thermodynamics, structure, and properties strongly interact with each other, as well as with the atmosphere and the sea. The surface conditions over the ice-covered Baltic Sea show high spatial variability, which cannot be described by two surface types (such as ice and open water) only. The variability is strongly reflected to the radiative and turbulent surface fluxes. The Baltic Sea has served as a testbed for several developments in the theory of sea ice dynamics. Experiences with advanced models have increased our understanding on sea ice dynamics, which depends on the ice thickness distribution, and in turn redistributes the ice thickness. During the latest decade, advance has been made in studies on sea ice structure, surface albedo, penetration of solar radiation, sub-surface melting, and formation of superimposed ice and snow ice. A high vertical resolution has been found as a prerequisite to successfully model thermodynamic processes during the spring melt period. A few observations have demonstrated how the river discharge and ice melt affect the stratification of the oceanic boundary layer below the ice and the oceanic heat flux to the ice bottom. In general, process studies on ice-ocean interaction have been rare. In the future, increasingly multidisciplinary studies are needed with close links between sea ice physics, geochemistry and biology. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Existing research methods for biological effects of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) are comparison between groups, with inability to exclude individual differences in cell sensitivity or changes in conditions during experiment. This work proposed a method for real-time effects observation of ELF-EMFs in the same cell and same condition. The stability domain was used to identify the stability of hippocampal neurons before ELF-EMFs exposure. At the time of electromagnetic field intervention (t=60 s), ELF-EMFs were exposed to hippocampal neurons at 0, 0.09, 0.38, 0.76, 7.33 and 14.78 mT, respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ fluorescence response curves of hippocampal neurons were recorded in real-time, and the autocorrelation function between ELF-EMFs and fluorescence response was established. The results showed as follows: (1) The step properties of fluorescence response were clear at the burst times of ROS and Ca2+, which were important indicator to identify the real-time response; (2) The response time of ROS and Ca2+ to ELF-EMFs were delayed and inconsistent; (3) ROS and Ca2+ had dose-dependent response to ELF-EMFs; (4) The response of ROS to ELF-EMFs was complex; (5) The response of Ca2+ to ELF-EMFs was asymptotically stable. When correlation function exceeded 0.3, the real-time response of ELF-EMFs and ROS/Ca2+ was correlated. It was concluded that a real-time response method of intracellular ROS and Ca2+ to ELF-EMFs exposure was feasible for the evaluation of electromagnetic bioeffects.

AB  - Cobia (Rachycentron canadum) is an important cultured marine fish species in southern China. It is characterized by fast growth. Due to the effects of climate change on water oxygen levels and seawater temperatures, the understanding of the influence of environmental changes on cobia culture has become important. In this study, to explore the stress and adaptability of cobia under hypoxia-reoxygenation conditions, the fish were exposed to an oxygen-deficient environment with dissolved oxygen (DO) level of 2.64 +/- 0.25 mg/L. Serum liver function target, lipid metabolism-related enzymes and the serum antioxidant capability were detected in cobia under acute hypoxic stress after which fish returned to normal DO level (6.34 +/- 0.15 mg/L) at 8, 24 and 48 h. Conventional paraffin sectioning and hematoxylin and eosin (H-E) staining were used to observe gill and liver tissues of cobia by electron microscopy. After hypoxic stress, the activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in cobia decreased. Under acute hypoxic stress, the gill patches of the fish were contracted and slightly curved. Liver disorder and vacuoles appeared between liver tissues. After reoxygenation, SOD and catalase (CAT) were recovered to the level of the control group with time, and all peaks appeared. The gill and liver of fish were also recovered with time. The results showed that hypoxic stress could cause oxidative damage to cobia.

AB  - The hermatypic coral ecosystems of the southern coast of Jalisco, Mexico, present an important species richness and coverage for the Mexican Central Pacific. However, knowledge of these ecosystems of the Jalisco coast is fragmented. Studies have concentrated on few localities, employing a limited number of coral health indicators, and gaps still remain in the knowledge of ecosystem structure and its local and mesoscale variation. This study evaluated spatial variations in the coral assemblage structure in six sites on the southern coast of Jalisco, Mexico, five of which had never been studied before. Sampling was conducted in September 2019, utilizing a total of 35 transects (each of 25 m in length). The cover of each coral species was recorded, as well as other benthic groups and substrate types. Different community attributes, patterns of similarity in coral species and their relationships with the benthic habitat structure were evaluated in each site. The results showed that the observed richness (8 species) represented 83.7% of that expected by chance. Significant spatial variation was found between coral patch sites and coral community sites, in terms of species richness, Shannon diversity and live coral cover, as well as in the structure of the coral assemblage and the benthic habitat. The results evidenced these conditions despite the existence of a considerable dominance of branched corals of the genus Pocillopora. The species that contributed most to the differences between coral patch sites and coral community sites were Pocillopora damicornis, Pocillopora capitata and Pocillopora verrucosa. For their part, the benthic habitat structural elements that favored the differences between site conditions were live coral cover and turf.

AB  - Over the last decade, electrolyzed water (EW) produced by salt and tap water has gained importance due to its antimicrobial effects. Regarding to chlorine-based compounds, EW also used in post-harvest safety of food processing and sterilization of surfaces. The latest studies suggested that EW might act as wound healing agent due to anti-infective and cell proliferative properties. In this study, we evaluated acute contact cytotoxicity in L929 mice fibroblast cells and wound healing activity of EWsin vitro.In addition, mutagenic activity was evaluated by Ames test with and without metabolic activation by S9 fraction and the stability profile of freshly prepared EWs has been followed up. According to the results, strong acid (StAEW) and mixed EW (MEW) showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity due to possible high HOCl concentration, while slightly acidic and catholyte EW (CEW) were not cytotoxic even applied directly for 30 sec. Further, StAEW and CEW showed a significant increase in L929 cell migration in scratch assay. Likewise, with/ without metabolic activation, neither of EWs had shown mutagenic profile in TA 98 and TA100 strains ofSalmonella typhimurium.Follow-up of ORP (oxidation-reduction potential), pH and FCC (free chlorine concentration) showed that temperature and light were important storage conditions to maintain a stable profile particularly for ORP and FCC, which are the most important indicators for biological activity of EW. According to the present findings, it can be suggested that particularly StAEW, may represent a valuable wound healing agent with an achievable, economical and easy production system when stored under proper conditions.

AB  - Aeolian sediment transport, deposition, and erosion have been ongoing throughout Mars's history. This record of widespread aeolian processes is preserved in landforms and geologic units that retain important clues about past environmental conditions including wind patterns. In this study we describe landforms within Melas Chasma, Valles Marineris, that occur in distinct groups with linear to crescentic shapes, arranged with a characteristic wavelength; some possess slope profiles analogous to modern sand dunes yet show evidence for lithification. Based on the features' dimensions, asymmetry, and spatial patterns relative to modern equivalents, we interpret these landforms to be two classes of aeolian bedforms: decameter-scale megaripples and sand dunes. The presence of superposed erosional features and depositional units indicates that these landforms were cemented and likely ancient. Melas paleodunes are found atop Hesperian-aged layered deposits, but we estimate them to be younger, likely lithified in the Amazonian period. Although a range of degradation was observed, some paleodunes are >10 m tall and maintain steep lee sides (>25 degrees), an uncommon scenario for terrestrial examples as other geologic processes lead to dune obliteration. The preserved paleobedform geometries are largely consistent with those of modern aeolian indicators, suggesting no major shifts in wind regime or contributing boundary conditions. Finally, we propose that their appearance and context require sequential periods of dune migration, stabilization following catastrophic burial, cementation, differential erosion, exposure, and burial. The presence of wholly preserved duneforms appears to be more common on Mars compared to the Earth and may signal something important about Martian landscape evolution.

AB  - A large portion of natural gas is transferred through transmission pipelines. For these facilities, in the United States, external corrosion has led to more than 1700 failures in the past decades, causing a property damage of approximately $189 M. Such numbers highlight the importance of maintaining such facilities in safe conditions to postpone corrosion failure. Given such criticality, addressing pipeline availability is of high importance from economic consequences perspective for a national economy. However, most of the developed methods merely rely on considering costs, reliability or condition levels as maintenance decision criteria and ignore the importance of continuity of operation and pipeline availability. In this research, a maintenance planning framework is proposed for external corrosion of gas transmission pipelines through an availability-centered reliability-based maintenance planning procedure. This framework is based on the pipeline reliability profile obtained from a Monte Carlo simulation. This simulation is carried on a previously developed failure prediction model for gas transmission pipelines buried in the Great Plains region of the U.S. and considers failure uncertainties. In addition, a discrete event simulation (DES) approach is proposed to assess an availability-cost indicator of different maintenance scheduling alternatives for the case study of a 24-inch gas pipeline. This research reveals that a combination of wrap and replacement maintenance actions at the service life of 30.1 and 40.5 years respectively, is the most effective maintenance alternative in terms of improvement of availability per unit cost for the presented case study. This framework can help pipeline professionals in maintaining such facilities by considering their criticality using an availability-based maintenance scheduling approach. Such method can complement the conventional cost-based industry practices.

AB  - Human fecal pollution in water constitute a serious risk to the public health, nevertheless the indicator microorganisms commonly used to detect the levels of fecal pollution does not identify the specific source. The detection of certain Bifidobacterium species as B. adolescentis and B. dentium have been proposed as an effective marker of human fecal contamination, but this has not yet been demonstrated in tropical environmental conditions. The aim of the present work was to determine the Bifidobacteria profile in one sample of water from the Mesolandia Swamp in the Colombian Caribbean and feces samples of 260 human and 94 domestic animals from a human settlement around the swamp. DNA from all the samples was amplified by PCR using specific specie primers based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence and separated by DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis). DGGE bands were excised, reamplified, sequenced, and compared to GenBank database. Bifidobacterial DGGE profiles showed that eight species of Bifidobacterium that were found in the water sample, were also present in the human and animal feces. Bifidobacterium adolescentis and B. dentium described as potential human fecal pollution indicators were found in domestic animals. In this study under the environmental and experimental conditions evaluated was not possible to find a Bifidobacterium species as specific marker of human fecal contamination in tropical areas. However, the applied method in this study could be useful to detect fecal pollution in tropical waters allowing a nearest approximation to the origin of the fecal pollution compared with cultural traditional methods, since it was possible to find identical DNA sequences in the water and in the fecal samples.

AB  - This paper aims at analyzing whether existing economic value estimates for forest ecosystem services (ES) might be transferred and used for valuation purposes elsewhere, and whether these data are appropriate for application in forest management. Many forest ES are public goods or positive externalities, and as a consequence they do not have a market price. The valuation of forest ES can provide important information for decision making in forest management and planning as well as in political processes, especially by allowing the comparison of different alternatives and helping set priorities for practical actions, as well as developing financial incentives or support mechanisms. We analyze whether an integrated economic valuation model for forest ES can be developed based on existing published data. To achieve this, we assess to which extent a benefit transfer could be expedient, and which challenges must be addressed. Based on a literature search, we compiled an extensive database of forest ES values. Given that these values vary substantially for the same ES, such a database alone does not seem useful to serve as a decision and management support tool. In addition, the available information mainly focuses on forests as such, and does not include desirable forest composition and management targets. If existing estimates should be transferred and used for forest management decisions, both the background conditions of the primary studies and the indicators used for valuation need to be specified in detail. The most expedient approach in this context seemed to be a valuation function transfer based on a broad set of indicators, offering the possibility to adapt the valuation function to changing background conditions.

AB  - Introduction: Heavy metals (HM) are dangerous elements due to their toxicity and prevalence play an important role in the environmental pollution and hazards to health risk. Impact of HM at high concentrations may lead to the failures of urinary bladder (UB) structure and functions. The aim of our study was to determine the readaptive changes in the UB of the rats and effectiveness of vitamin E using after the long-term intake of the HMS mixtures. Materials and Methods: We used mature male laboratory rats which were divided into three series with special experimental conditions after the influence of HM. The detailed analysis of the UB state was performed by using morphometric, spectrophotometric, histological and electron microscopy methods. Results: We had determined that the long-term intake of HM caused the significant increase of their accumulation in the tissue and morphometric changes of UB. Obtained results after the cancelation of the HM effect demonstrate smooth morphological restructuring of the UB wall with the reduction of difference of accumulation and morphometric indicators with control. The adjustment of vitamin E during there adaptation period showed better result recovery and optimization of all parameters, but they haven't completely returned to normal state. Conclusions: The influence of HMS mixture led to significant negative effect on the UB at all stages of research. However, under the conditions of readaptation the tendency towards a certain stabilization of all indicators was observed, but they didn't completely pass to the end of the study. The vitamin E using has caused the acceleration and improved the development of readaptive change after HM exposure.

AB  - Dieng geothermal field including its volcanic geothermal system is dominated by hot water. Brine water is characterized by high salinity, content of chloride (Cl-), amorphous silica (SiO2), Na+, and K+. The condition of brine water has potential for the formation of amorphous silica scale in the re-injection pipeline which is one of the obstacle in the electrical energy production. The scale prevention on re-injection pipes was performed with non-acid re-injection system. Nevertheless, the scale formed in the re-injection pipe is still relatively thick due to the non-optimal sludge. This research is focused in optimizing the deposition of sludge. The research aim is to apply scale prevention technique on re-injection pipeline by involving engineering technology. The study was conducted through laboratory experiments with factorial design method 2(3) (two levels of three factors). Those three factors are pH, concentrations of coagulants and flocculants concentrations which act as the independent variables. The indicator is the volume of sludge deposition and turbidity of brine water which act as the dependent variables. The result showed that the most significant factor is pH, whereas the concentrations of coagulant and flocculant are preserved to accelerate and stabilize the sludge deposition. The optimal condition is achieved at the level of pH 8, the concentration of 10 ppm coagulant (PAC), and 1 ppm flocculants (Polyamide). These parameters are then used for the preparation of scaling process technology on the prevention of re-injection pipeline by adding some equipments on settling ponds. Therefore, in addition to reduce environmental degradation, it also produces sludge that has potential to be used as raw materials for other industries.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima) is one of the most invasive tree species in Slovenia. Since its invasion into forests is expected, we must raise public awareness and prepare guidelines for forest management in the presence of invasive species. The aim of the research was to predict the potential distribution of tree of heaven, to detect the most endangered forest communities and to discover what characteristics of forest stands make them susceptible.
   Materials and methods: From databases, literature sources and field observations, we collected all localities in which tree of heaven appears. We assigned these localities geological, geomorphological, soil and climatic data. We then built an ecological model and prepared a map of potential distribution. Based on the modelled future distribution of tree of heaven, we randomly selected and sampled 50 plots in the area in which invasion is expected and outside of this area. We analyzed their morphological and ecological strategies, ecological conditions, origin and social behavior spectrum.
   Results: We found that tree of heaven has the largest invasive potential in western Slovenia. The model showed that the most susceptible forest communities appear in warm areas with pronounced climatic seasonality. Many differences occur in floristics and plant traits of forest communities in extreme positions, in terms of susceptibility to invasion, but in transitional areas, these differences are not so obvious, only a higher pH of soil and absence of species characteristic of acidophilus communities are an indicator of vulnerability.
   Conclusion: Susceptibility to invasion by tree of heaven is mainly influenced by macro-climatic conditions; in the transitional zone, communities thriving on shallow soils over carbonate bedrock are more vulnerable.

AB  - The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response to chronic stress is far from straight forward, particularly with regards to animal welfare. There are reports of no effect as well as both decreases and increases in cortisol after chronic stressors. Therefore, the first aim of the present study was to determine how measures of compromised welfare, such as chronic pain and haematological anomalies, related to cortisol levels in domestic horses (Equus caballus). Domestic horses are an informative model to investigate the impact of chronic stress (due to environment, pain, work, housing conditions...) on the HPA axis. The second aim was to determine whether levels of fecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) may be used as an indicator of welfare measures. The present study used fifty-nine horses (44 geldings and 15 mares), from three riding centres in Brittany, France. The primary findings show that horses whose welfare was clearly compromised (as indicated by an unusual ears backward position, presence of vertebral problems or haematological anomalies, e.g. anaemia) also had lower levels of both FCM and plasma cortisol. This work extends our previous findings showing that withdrawn postures, indicators of depressive-like behavior in horses, are associated with lower plasma cortisol levels. We also found that evening plasma cortisol levels positively correlated with FCM levels in horses. Future research aims to determine the extent to which factors of influence on welfare, such as living conditions (e.g. single stalls versus group housing in pasture or paddocks), early life factors, and human interaction, act as mediators of cortisol levels in horses.

AB  - A total of 230 isolates of lactic acid bacteria were isolated from gastrointestinal tracts (GIT) of indigenous chickens purchased from local market in Bang Rakam district, Phitsanulok, Thailand. Among 230 isolates, only 7 isolates, named CM6CR07, CM6CR11, CF1GI15, CF1GI14, CF1GI17-1, CF1GI17-2 and CF1GI 19 showed an inhibition zone against indicator strains. Bacteriocin activity was completely inactivated when Neutralized Cell Free Supernatants (NCFS) of the isolates were treated with proteases, confirming the proteinaceous nature of the bacteriocin component. NCFS of all selected bacteriocin producing lactic acid bacteria (SBP-LAB) retained their bacteriocin activity after heating at 100 C-omicron for 30 min. All of SBP-LAB were identified as Enterococcus faecalis. These Ent. faecalis isolates harbored the same virulence genes. All strains were positive for gelE (gelatinase), efaA(fs) (cell wall adhesins), hyl (hyaluronidase), ace (adhesin of collagen protein), cylL(L) (cytolysin structural subunit) and cylL(s) (cytolysin structural subunit) and were negative for asal (aggregation substance), agg (aggregation protein involved in adherence to eukaryotic cells), and esp (enterococcal surface protein). These Ent. faecalis showed a wide range of inhibitory spectrum against food-spoilage and food-borne pathogens when studied by agar spot test. The CFS and NCFS also inhibited some of food-spoilage and food-borne pathogenic indicator strains when checked by agar well diffusion assay. All of these Ent. faecalis survived simulated stomach conditions, whereas all of them could survive in conditions of simulated intestinal juice. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In agricultural catchments, diffuse nutrient fluxes (mainly nitrogen N and phosphorus P), are observed to pollute receiving waters and cause eutrophication. Organicmatter (OM) is important in mediating biogeochemical processes in freshwaters. Time series of the variation in nutrient and OMloads give insights into flux processes and their impact on biogeochemistry but are costly to maintain and challenging to analyse for elements that are highly reactive in the environment. We evaluated the capacity of the automatedmonitoring to capture typically low baseflow concentrations of the reactive forms of nutrients and OM: total reactive phosphorus (TRP), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) and tryptophan-like fluorescence (TLF). We compared the performance of in situ monitoring (wet chemistry analyser, UV-vis and fluorescence sensors) and automated grab sampling without instantaneous analysis using autosamplers. Wefound that automatic grab sampling shows storage transformations for TRP and TLF and do not reproduce the diurnal concentration pattern captured by the in situ analysers. The in situ TRP and fluorescence analysers respond to temperature variation and the relationship is concentration-dependent. Accurate detection of low P concentrations is particularly challenging due to large errors associated with both the in situ and autosampler measurements. Aquatic systems can be very sensitive to even low concentrations of P typical of baseflow conditions. Understanding transformations and measurement variability in reactive forms of nutrients and OM associated with in situ analysis is of great importance for understanding in-stream biogeochemical functioning and establishing robust monitoring protocols.

AB  - Seed germination is responsive to diverse environmental, hormonal and chemical signals. Germination rates (i.e. speed and distribution in time) reveal information about timing, uniformity and extent of germination in seed populations and are sensitive indicators of seed vigour and stress tolerance. Population-based threshold (PBT) models have been applied to describe germination responses to temperature, water potential, hormones, ageing and oxygen. However, obtaining detailed data on germination rates of seed populations requires repeated observations at frequent times to construct germination time courses, which is labour intensive and often impractical. Recently, instruments have been developed to measure repeatedly the respiration (oxygen consumption) of individual seeds following imbibition, providing complete respiratory time courses for populations of individual seeds in an automated manner. In this study, we demonstrate a new approach that enables the use of single-seed respiratory data, rather than germination data, to characterize the responses of seed populations to diverse conditions. We applied PBT models to single-seed respiratory data and compared the results to similar analyses of germination time courses. We found consistent and quantitatively comparable relationships between seed respiratory and germination patterns in response to temperature, water potential, abscisic acid, gibberellin, respiratory inhibitors, ageing and priming. This close correspondence between seed respiration and germination time courses enables the use of semi-automated respiratory measurements to assess seed vigour and quality parameters. It also raises intriguing questions about the fundamental relationship between the respiratory capacities of seeds and the rates at which they proceed toward completion of germination.

AB  - Mountain regions are characterized by complex biophysical and marginal socio-economic conditions that contribute to the vulnerability of agricultural communities. Owing to the extremely heterogeneous conditions in mountains, it becomes imperative to understand the spatial distribution of vulnerability at fine-scale. This study assesses the inherent vulnerability of agricultural communities at village level for the entire state of Uttarakhand. Inherent vulnerability, conceptualized as an internal property of agriculture dependent communities, is measured as a function of sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Data on 36 indicators, reflecting the social and ecological dimensions of sensitivity and adaptive capacity, was collected from secondary sources for 15,285 villages. Each indicator was weighed according to its importance in determining vulnerability using Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and finally aggregated to map the spatial distribution of inherent vulnerability under five classes. To enable more effective adaptation planning, identification of vulnerability hotspots was done using local Moran's I. Our analysis reveals that majority of the villages have very low (36.1%) and low (19.6%) adaptive capacity characterized by the poor developmental and high agricultural constraints. Overall the state observes high vulnerability (0.66 +/- 0.15), with about 23.6% and 24.7% villages classified under very high and high vulnerability class respectively. The spatial pattern of inherent vulnerability shows significant attitudinal gradient with most of the vulnerability hotspots villages located in middle attitudinal zone. The outcomes of the study assist the policy interventions in prioritizing allocation of resources to enhance the capacities of agricultural communities inhabiting the identified inherent vulnerability hotspots.

AB  - Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) is an important forage and turf grass species adapted to cold, arid and semiarid environments. Germination and seedling establishment of F.arundinacea cultivars is constrained by the low soil moisture found in these regions. Genome size was found to positively correlate with latitude of origin, suggesting that structural changes in DNA may play a role in environmental adaptation. We investigated the effects of low soil moisture on the germination and early establishment and their correlation with relative DNA content using 14 wild F.arundinacea populations collected from various regions in Iran and two commercial turf cultivars. The populations were evaluated under 100% (-0.03 matric potential [MPa]), 80% (-0.2), 60% (-0.6) and 40% (-1.4) field capacity (FC) conditions. Seed germination and root and leaf growth decreased under reduced soil water content. Cluster analysis revealed that the populations fell into four groups. Populations in cluster I showed the greatest tolerance to low soil moisture and cluster IV was the least tolerant. Isfahan' and Gonabad' populations had the best final germination and longer leaf and root length at 40% FC. Studies to identify indices that were involved in drought resistance revealed that final germination, leaf length and seedling vigor index were most important evaluating indicators for F.arundinacea populations. Flow cytometric relative DNA content of the wild populations was negatively correlated with germination, leaf length and seedling vigor index. The drought tolerance populations in cluster I could be potentially useful germplasm for a breeding program to develop superior cultivars for arid and semiarid regions.

AB  - Diminished expression is a diagnostic feature of a range of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders/conditions and is often unresponsive to treatment, is present across premorbid, first episode and various clinical states, and is considered a poor prognostic indicator. Surprisingly, little is known about diminished expression. The present study sought to address this issue by evaluating a commercially-available computerized facial analysis software for understanding diminished expressivity. We analyzed natural facial expression from a series of laboratory interaction tasks in 28 individuals with psychometric schizotypy - defined as the personality organization reflecting a putative genetic schizophrenia liability, and 26 matched controls. We evaluated (a) feasibility - defined in terms of the number of video frames recognized by the software, (b) reliability-defined in terms of correlations between facial expression variables across the three laboratory interactions, and (c) construct validity - defined in terms of relationships to clinical variables. For most subjects (similar to 80%), approximately three-quarters of the video frames were analyzable by the software; however, a minority of the videos were essentially unreadable. The facial expression variables showed excellent reliability across interaction conditions. In terms of construct validity, facial expression variables were significantly related to a measure of psychoticism, tapping subjective cognitive concerns and "first-rank" schizophrenia symptoms, but were generally not different between groups. Facial expression variables were generally not significantly related to measures of depression, anxiety, paranoia or, surprisingly, self-reported negative schizotypy. While computerized facial analysis appears to be a reliable and promising method of understanding diminished expressivity across the schizophrenia-spectrum, some work remains. Implications are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Predicting and quantifying impacts of potential carbon dioxide (CO2) leakage into shallow aquifers that overlie geologic CO2 storage formations is an important part of developing reliable carbon storage techniques. Leakage of CO2 through fractures, faults or faulty wellbores can reduce groundwater pH, inducing geochemical reactions that release solutes into the groundwater and pose a risk of degrading groundwater quality. In order to help quantify this risk, predictions of metal concentrations are needed during geologic storage of CO2. Here, we present regional-scale reactive transport simulations, at relatively fine-scale, of CO2 leakage into shallow aquifers run on the PFLOTRAN platform using high-performance computing. Multiple realizations of heterogeneous permeability distributions were generated using standard geostatistical methods. Increased statistical anisotropy of the permeability field resulted in more lateral and vertical spreading of the plume of impacted water, leading to increased Pb2+ (lead) concentrations and lower pH at a well down gradient of the CO2 leak. Pb2+ concentrations were higher in simulations where calcite was the source of Pb2+ compared to galena. The low solubility of galena effectively buffered the Pb2+ concentrations as galena reached saturation under reducing conditions along the flow path. In all cases, Pb2+ concentrations remained below the maximum contaminant level set by the EPA. Results from this study, compared to natural variability observed in aquifers, suggest that bicarbonate (HCO3) concentrations may be a better geochemical indicator of a CO2 leak under the conditions simulated here.

AB  - Objectives: Women should differ in their reproductive strategies according to their nutritional status. We tested a hypothesis that women who have a good nutritional status early in life, as indicated by a shorter waiting time to the first birth (first birth interval, FBI), are able to afford higher costs of reproduction than women who have worse nutritional condition. Methods: We collected data on 377 women who got married between the years 1782 and 1882 in a natural fertility population in rural Poland. The study group was divided into tertiles based on the length of FBI. Results: Women with the shortest FBI had a higher number of children (P = 0.005), higher number of sons (P = 0.01), and shorter mean interbirth intervals (P = 0.06). Women who had ever given birth to twins had shorter FBI than women of singletons (20.1 and 26.1 months, respectively; P = 0.049). Furthermore, women with a shorter FBI, despite having higher costs of reproduction, did not have a different lifespan than women with a longer FBI. Conclusions: Our results suggest that women who were in better energetic condition (shorter length of FBI), achieved higher reproductive success without reduction in lifespan. FBI reflects interindividual variation, which may result from variation in nutritional status early in life and thus may be a good predictor of subsequent reproductive strategy. We propose to use FBI as an indicator of women's nutritional status in studies of historical populations, especially when information about social status is not available. Am. J. Hum. Biol., 2013.

AB  - We used elemental carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and hydrogen ratios (C/N, N/P and H/C) with total organic carbon (TOC) and total phosphorus (TP) as well as stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) to investigate the source and depositional conditions of organic matter in sediments from Zeekoevlei, the largest freshwater lake in South Africa. Typical C/N (10-12), H/C ratios (>= 1.7) and delta C-13(organic) values (-22 to -19 parts per thousand) together with the increase in TOC concentration indicate elevated primary productivity in lower middle (18-22 cm) and top (0-8 cm) sections of the sediment cores. Seepage of nutrients from a nearby waste water treatment plant, rapid urbanization and heavily fertilized farming in the catchments are responsible for the increased productivity. Consistent with this, measured delta(15) N-organic values (similar to 11) indicate increased raw sewage input towards the top-section of the core. Although cyanobacterial blooms are evident from the low delta N-15 values (similar to 3 parts per thousand) in mid-section of the core, they did not outnumber the phytoplankton population. Low N/P ratio (similar to 0) and high TP (100-2,200 mg l(-1)) support cyanobacterial growth under N limited condition, and insignificant input of macrophytes towards the organic matter pool. Dredging in 1983, caused sub-aerial exposure of the suspended and surface sediments, and affected organic matter preservation in the upper mid-section (12-14 cm) of the core.

AB  - Dormancy and flowering responses of the strawberry cultivars Korona and Elsanta have been studied in controlled environments. After short day (SD) floral induction for 5 weeks at temperatures ranging from 9 to 27 degrees C, long photoperiods only were required for optimal leaf and inflorescence growth and development at 18 degrees C, with no additional effect of chilling. However, with extended SD treatment for 10 or 15 weeks at 15 degrees C the plants entered the usual semi-dormant state typical for strawberry plants in late autumn, and subsequent long day (LD) conditions could not fully reverse the restrained growth habit. Extended SD treatment at 6 degrees C did not bring about this dormant state, indicating that the dormancy-inducing effect of SD is continuously nullified by such low temperature. When SD induced plants were forced under continued SD conditions, leaf and inflorescence growth were strongly restrained even in plants that had been chilled for up to 6 weeks. The restrained plant growth habit attained in SD, proved not to be a reliable indicator of the dormant state of the plants as it occurred also at low temperature. Floral induction in 'Korona' and 'Elsanta' was shown to have an obligatory SD requirement at temperatures ranging from 9 to 21 degrees C, while SD floral induction was marginal at 27 degrees C. The floral inducing effect of SD was also strongly reduced at temperatures below 9 degrees C. Application of these findings for multiple cropping of inherently single-cropping strawberry cultivars in winter season greenhouse production systems is discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Phytoplankton diagnostic photopigments in near-surface waters (approximate to 0.5 m) were identified and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography beginning in April 1994 in the Neuse River Estuary and in October 1999 in the Pamlico Sound, North Carolina. Photopigment concentrations were analyzed using ChemTax to determine the class-specific biomass of the dominant phytoplankton groups. Long-term annual and seasonal trends in phytoplankton biomass and composition were characterized along the river-estuarine continuum and compared to river flow rates, which were variable because of droughts, uncharacteristic seasonal rainfall patterns, and, since 1996, an increase in the frequency of tropical storms and hurricanes. We tested the hypothesis that temporal and spatial patterns of phytoplankton biomass and composition were largely controlled by changes in river flow rate through associated changes in salinity and residence time or through physical transport and advection of phytoplankton classes with river flow along the estuary. Significant interannual, seasonal, and spatial variability in phytoplankton biomass and composition was observed and coincided with variability in river flow rates. The five dominant phytoplankton classes (Chlorophyceae, Cryptophyceae, Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyceae, and Dinophyceae) were physically displaced downstream during periods of elevated river flow. Dinoflagellates were reduced in abundance during high flow conditions, especially in the upper Neuse River Estuary. The abundance of cyanobacteria was also reduced throughout the system during elevated river flow conditions, although chlorophytes were more abundant. Changes in hydrology can be a useful indicator of seasonal phytoplankton distribution and higher level compositional changes along hydrologic gradients in these and similar systems.

AB  - We examined the behavioural ecology of mothers and calves during the first year of life to identify variables predicting calf mortality among bottlenose dolphins. Specifically, we investigated whether the primary cause of calf mortality was poor calf condition or shark predation. Seventy-five per cent of calves that died (N = 12) showed visible signs of poor health compared with 4.7% of the survivors (N = 21). Calves that spent more time swimming in infant position (in contact under the mother) in the first year of life were more likely to die by 3 years of age than calves that spent less time swimming in infant position. No other behavioural or ecological measures tested were associated with calf mortality. We suggest that the mother and/or calf may compensate for poor calf health by increasing the time spent in contact with the mother. In contrast, frequent mother-calf separation and high rates of calf socializing and foraging are proposed to be indicators of vigour. Although most of our results do not support the predation hypothesis, mothers altered one behaviour in relation to predation risk. Mothers rested less in deep water during the warm months, where and when predation risk was high, than during the cool months, when predation risk was low, suggesting that predation risk influenced maternal vigilance. However, calf mortality was not higher in warm months than in cool months. Our results suggest that poor calf condition, not predation, is the primary cause of calf mortality.

AB  - Information about water management and crop stress response for red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) seed production is limited. This study determined red clover seed crop water requirements and evaluated crop water stress index (CWSI) and fraction of available soil-water used for timing supplemental irrigation. Experiments were conducted at Corvallis, OR, on a Woodburn silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Aquultic Argixeroll) in 1990 and 1991. Six irrigation treatments were used to assess within- and between-crop season water requirements. As a consequence of root disease in 1991, the fraction of available soil water used by plants in the different treatments was generally less in 1991 than 1990. Also, seed production water-use efficiency was lower in 1991 than 1990. Two distinct non-stressed baselines for canopy-air temperature differences versus vapor pressure deficit were identified that were related to increasing leaf senescence and crop aging. The CWSI values across all treatments were negatively associated with plant water potentials (r = -0.87). The CWSI values were similar within similar treatments in both years indicating that root rot damage rather than available soil water was limiting plant water uptake in 1991. The CWSI generally increased faster than fraction of available soil-water used, Unlike fraction of available soil-water used, CWSI integrated the total plant environment, detecting changes due to root disease in 1991. Under the conditions of this experiment, a single irrigation filling the active soil profile at CWSI approximate to 0.28 substantially increased seed yield compared with the nonirrigated control. The CWSI was a useful indicator of red clover water stress status and can be used to schedule clover seed irrigations under typical western Oregon climatic conditions.

AB  - Research on hydrogeochemistry for mineral exploration for inland Australia includes development of weathering models and extensive mine-scale and regional groundwater data. Mineral saturation indices for groundwater, activity-activity plots and reaction modelling simulate weathering of volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) deposits in deeply weathered environments. At 10m or more below surface, dissolved O-2 is very low and other solutes such as sulfate, carbonate and nitrate are more likely oxidants. Modelling indicates that these processes differ from oxic weathering of highly eroded terrains, and provide the framework to develop robust hydrogeochemical exploration procedures in covered terrains. Sulfide weathering potentially occurs in two or more phases that effect surrounding groundwaters in differing manners. Deeper oxidative alteration of sulfides (e.g. bornite to chalcopyrite), occurring tens to hundreds of metres below surface, uses sulfate and carbonate as oxidants, causing neutral to alkaline conditions. In this zone, only pyritic massive sulfides potentially generate acidic conditions. Thus, deep sulfide-rich rocks are indicated by sulfate-depleted groundwater. Closer to the surface, sulfides are oxidised to soluble sulfates by dissolved nitrate, with much less acid production than if dissolved oxygen was the main oxidant. Thus, in shallow groundwater, sulfides are indicated by sulfate enrichment and nitrate depletion. Elements are released from sulfides and wall rocks by acid or alkaline conditions. The derived FeS (pH-Eh + Fe + Mn) and AcidS (Li + Mo + Ba + Al) indices distinguish sulfide systems through tens of metres of cover. VHMS systems are distinguished from other non-economic sulfide deposits where there is little transported cover, using various dissolved elements, including Zn, Pb and Cu. Elsewhere, patchiness' and limited aerial extent of metal signals are due to adsorption effects, that intensify with depth. Other elements such as Mn and Co have lesser diminution effects, but are less selective indicators for VHMS. There is exploration potential for elements such as Pt or Ag. These varying sulfide indicators have moderate utility, even for large-scale (approximate to 5km spacing) sampling. Results indicate that hydrogeochemistry can add value to greenfields exploration for VHMS ore deposits in deeply weathered terrains. It is also moderately successful at indicating the presence of sulfide-rich systems (whether magmatic or hydrothermal) under >100m cover, thus providing a rapid and cost-effective regional prospectivity tool for deeply buried terrains. Such mineral exploration tools will encourage exploration investment for more difficult regions of Australia and in other deeply weathered regions of the world.

AB  - Photovoltaic and CSP development are related to site specification. In addition to high levels of insolation, climate and environmental conditions have a great impact on the efficiency of these technologies. Soiling stands as a major parameter influencing the degradation of transmittance and reflectance for PV glass and CSP reflectors respectively, which decreases electrical performance. In this paper, the PV system and TraCS system (Tracking Cleanliness System) are used to evaluate the soiling effect in two sites with different climate conditions. Environmental variables such as air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and precipitation, are used as inputs to model soiling. The relationship between different input and output variables are analysed using two linear regression models in a simple form, and with the interaction between model predictors. An in-depth analysis is performed with an artificial neural network (ANN) model, to assess its ability to resolve the complexity of the soiling problem in relation to environmental parameters, and also for comparison with the linear models. The results show that in the region with relatively low rainfall soiling is significantly high and the soiling loss reach up in the summer season -1.07%/day. However, in the region with significant rainy days, the soiling loss is in the range of -0.18%/day in the same period of the year. On the other hand, the ANN model performed significantly in estimating the soiling ratio in comparison to the linear models in terms of R-2 values and statistical indicators.

AB  - Leukocyte profiles, such as the heterophile/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio, are influenced by several ecological and ecophysiological factors and are generally considered to be independent and robust indicators of stress levels in birds. We tested the hypotheses that Semipalmated Sandpiper Calidris pusilla presents a positive association between physiological stress (H/L ratio) and molt, and that there should be a negative association between physiological stress (H/L ratio) and body condition (mass). During its annual cycle, Semipalmated Sandpiper performs long-distance migrations and often arrives in South America in September/October when it can undergo molting before its migration to the north. In May, while preparing to return to its reproductive sites, Semipalmated Sandpiper increases its body mass. The research was carried out on Restinga Island of the Rio Paraiba estuary in northeast Brazil. Data collection took place during the wintering of Semipalmated Sandpiper in October 2017 and February and May 2018. We found a positive association between the H/L ratio and the presence of molt in October and February, but a negative association between the H/L ratio and body mass in May. Our results support the hypotheses that the presence of molt should be positively associated with the H/L ratio due to the high energy and nutritional costs that molting requires and that the H/L ratio and body mass should be negatively associated due to the favorable nutritional status of Semipalmated Sandpiper during its preparation to migrate to its reproductive areas.

AB  - The main directions of the destructive economic impact on business activities in the national security system have been identified, which allowed to identify possible risks for business activities and to develop a set of preventive measures to reduce the negative impact of external factors. Given the current conditions of the macroeconomic situation, it is necessary to constantly monitor the processes that take place in the external environment and have an impact on the state of economic security of business. With the help of international rating indices, which are an important tool, a significant reference point and an external source of information, Ukraine's place in international rankings has been tracked in the second section and a comprehensive assessment has been made, as the relevant rankings places by which world organizations mark Ukraine are indicators of its development. The interrelation and influence of the given indicators on the economic security of entrepreneurial activity are substantiated. According to the study of Ukraine's position in international rankings, it is concluded that Ukraine's position is currently unsatisfactory, Ukraine has not yet created safe conditions for business development: unstable tax legislation, significant corruption pressure and currency restrictions, lack of serious gains in investment attractiveness and to ensure national competitiveness, state support for business development is insufficient and unfocused; limited opportunities for financing state programs for business development. Entrepreneurial activity management in Ukraine is a direction of state policy, a set of measures and forms of economic, legal, and organizational impact on business and entrepreneurs, including through state support and protection of business entities, as well as state control over compliance requirements of the legislation by subjects of such an activity.

AB  - Expansion of agricultural commodity production is driving rapid deforestation in tropical countries. Several strategies including jurisdictional planning and producer or sectoral-level sourcing/certification have been used to counter this threat, each with its own limitations. There is growing interest in using jurisdictional sourcing (JS) as a hybrid that combines the best elements of each of these strategies. Specifically, JS involves bringing together key stakeholders in a given national or sub-national political jurisdiction to agree on a land-use plan that maintains forest ecosystems while promoting enhanced commodity production on degraded lands. Under JS, a key incentive for this agreement is the prospect of preferential sourcing from supply chain actors who want conversion-free commodities. As with any conservation strategy, the key questions are what defines JS and under what conditions is it likely to work? To help address these questions, we convened a group of practitioners/experts to develop a theory of change that explicitly defines what JS entails from both the perspective of a given jurisdiction as well as a global markets point of view. We also developed generic objectives and indicators that can be used to measure performance. We then vetted our initial drafts with a wider circle of JS practitioners/experts as well as through a review of relevant literature and against seven case studies. It is our hope that this framework can be used to inform the collection of more standardized data across JS strategies being implemented in different locations and conditions. This data could, in turn, inform more systematic assessments of JS strategies and ultimately, revisions to this theory of change as our collective knowledge improves.

AB  - Fossil diatom records from the Southern Ocean are needed to clarify the detailed conditions under warmer-than-present global climate in the Piacenzian Stage (3.60-2.588 Ma), and to provide direct evidence of simultaneity between changes in environmental conditions and diatom species turnovers. In this study, fossil diatom records between 3.5 and 2.8 Ma were investigated at two sites located along a latitudinal gradient within the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean (offshore from Prydz Bay and south-east of the Kerguelen Plateau). Paleoceanographic changes were assessed from assemblage changes of extant diatom indicators. Fluctuations of their relative percentages were compared with those of extinct diatom species. The diatom assemblage between 3.5 and 3.1 Ma consisted of open ocean species which indicate warmer-than-present SST. Notable increases in sea-ice associated species were identified at 3.3 Ma and 3.1 Ma at both sites. Our results suggest sea-ice existence during short intervals of 3.3 Ma and 3.1-2.8 Ma at the studied area. At both sites, relative abundances of species which have first occurrences during the Piacenzian, increased at 3.2-3.1 Ma, conversely, those of species which have last occurrences during the Piacenzian decreased at the same period. These diatom records show a correlation with cooling at 3.1 Ma suggested from extant indicators and compositional changes in fossil diatoms from the Southern Ocean. This comparison can provide insights into the environmental effects on diatom evolutionary acceleration, which can help identify ecologies of extinct species.

AB  - Alternative states maintained by feedbacks are notoriously difficult, if not impossible, to reverse. Although positive interactions that modify soil conditions may have the greatest potential to alter self-reinforcing feedbacks, the conditions leading to these state change reversals have not been resolved. In a 9-yr study, we modified horizontal connectivity of resources by wind or water on different geomorphic surfaces in an attempt to alter plant-soil feedbacks and shift woody-plant-dominated states back toward perennial grass dominance. Modifying connectivity resulted in an increase in litter cover regardless of the vector of transport (wind, water) followed by an increase in perennial grass cover 2 yr later. Modifying connectivity was most effective on sandy soils where wind is the dominant vector, and least effective on gravelly soils on stable surfaces with low sediment movement by water. We found that grass cover was related to precipitation in the first 5 yr of our study, and plant-soil feedbacks developed following 6 yr of modified connectivity to overwhelm effects of precipitation on sandy, wind-blown soils. These feedbacks persisted through time under variable annual rainfall. On alluvial soils, either plant-soil feedbacks developed after 7 yr that were not persistent (active soils) or did not develop (stable soils). This novel approach has application to drylands globally where desertified lands have suffered losses in ecosystem services, and to other ecosystems where connectivity-mediated feedbacks modified at fine scales can be expected to impact plant recovery and state change reversals at larger scales, in particular for wind-impacted sites.

AB  - In this work, used lube oil was treated using natural acid-free clay. Clay was added at different amounts (5, 10, and 20 g) to 100 mL of waste engine oil at various temperatures (250, 350, 400, and 450 degrees C) and mixed at a speed of 800 rpm for 30 min. After settling and separation, the treated oil was diluted with kerosene before being examined using a Ultraviolet-visible (UV) spectrophotometer. In order to achieve cost-effective recycling, this process is modeled using the response surface method (RSM). Five regression models (linear, quadratic, Two Factor Interactions (2FI), cubic, and reduced-order quadratic model) were developed, then tested, and examined by calculating the statistical performance indicators (R-2, R-adj(2), Akaike's Information Criterion corrected (AICc), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)). The results obtained reveal that the modified quadratic model outperforms the rest of the models in terms of the low value of RMSE, the lowest AICc, lowest BIC, and the highest R-2 and R-adj(2). The developed modified quadratic model is optimized successfully to predict optimum operation conditions. Results show that optimum operation conditions are at the minimum area under the curve for UV absorption at 223.358; this can be achieved with a process temperature of 266.246 degrees C and clay quantity of 5.331 g. This model agreed with experimental data regardless of the effectiveness of red clay in the therapy of lube oil.

AB  - Many reports have shown that grains play an important role in our daily lives and can provide energy and nutrients to protect us from various diseases, and they are considered to be indispensable parts of our lives. It has been reported that some constituents in grains could exert functional effects against HIV infections and multiple cancers. Zymolytic grain can produce some new useful molecules and thus support the cell nutrients in the human body. In this study, the effects of zymolytic grain extract (ZGE) supernatants on the changes of nematode indicators were investigated, including lifespan, self-brood size, and body length in environmental conditions (temperature, ultraviolet radiation or 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FUDR) stimuli). We found that, compared to the control group, the ZGE supernatant-feeding group could prolong the lifespan of nematodes under normal conditions. More importantly, ZGE supernatants could improve the ability of nematodes to resist stress. When the concentration of FUDR was 400 or 50 mu M, the ZGE supernatant-feeding group could prolong lifespan by an average of 38.4% compared to the control group, and the eggs of the ZGE supernatant-feeding group could hatch and develop into adults. These results indicated that ZGE could protect C. elegans from external stress and thus prolong their lifespan and improve the physiological state of nematodes. Therefore, ZGE supernatant has potential to be used as a nutritional product in antioxidant and anti-aging research.

AB  - Environmental contaminants, such as the trace element selenium (Se), are a continuing concern to species worldwide due to their potential pathophysiological effects, including their influence on the stress response mediated through glucocorticoids (GCs; stress hormones). Environmental concentrations of Se are increasing due to anthropogenic activities, including the incomplete combustion of coal and subsequent disposal of coal combustion wastes. However, most studies examining how Se affects GCs have been focused on lower trophic organisms. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of long-term Se exposure on traditionally used stress parameters and to identify which of these parameters best indicate Se accumulation in liver and kidney of the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), a top trophic carnivore found in the southeastern United States and known to inhabit Se-containing areas. Alligators were divided into three dietary treatments and fed prey spiked with 1000 or 2000ppm of selenomethionine (SeMet) or deionized water (control treatment) for 7weeks. Following the 7-week treatment protocol, blood and tissue samples were obtained to measure plasma corticosterone (CORT; the main crocodilian GC), tail scute CORT, the ratio of peripheral blood heterophils (H) to lymphocytes (L) as H/L ratio, and body condition. To evaluate which parameter best indicated Se accumulation in the liver and kidney, principal component and discriminant analyses were performed. The only parameter significantly correlated with liver and kidney Se concentrations was scute CORT. Our results suggest that measurement of CORT in tail scutes compared with plasma CORT, H/L ratios, and body condition is the best indicator of Se-exposure and accumulation in crocodilians.

AB  - The rapid assessment of cell viability is crucial for process optimization, e.g., during media selection, determination of optimal environmental growth conditions and for quality control. In the present study, the cells' electric anisotropy of polarizability (AP) as well as the mean cell length in Lactobacillus plantarum batch and fed-batch fermentations were monitored with electrooptical measurements coupled to fully automated sample preparation. It was examined, whether this measurement can be related to the cells' metabolic activity, and thus represents a suitable process analytical technology. It is demonstrated that the AP is an early indicator to distinguish between suitable and unsuitable growth conditions in case of a poor energy regeneration or cell membrane defects in L. plantarum batch and fed-batch cultivations. It was shown that the applied method allowed the monitoring of physiological and morphological changes of cells in various growth phases in response to a low pH-value, substrate concentration changes, temperature alterations, exposure to air and nutrient limitation. An optimal range for growth in batch mode was achieved, if the AP remained above 25.10(-28) F.m(2) and the mean cell length at similar to 2.5 mu m. It was further investigated, in which way the AP develops after freeze-drying of samples, which were taken in different cultivation phases. It was found that the AP increased most rapidly in resuspended samples from the retardation and late stationary phases, while samples from the early stationary phase recovered slowly. Electrooptical measurements provide valuable information about the physiologic and morphologic state of L. plantarum cells, e.g., when applied as starter cultures or as probiotic compounds.

AB  - This study has used remotely sensed data of Landsat-8 for monitoring open dumps of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) using vegetation health as a bio-indicator and thermal emissions from it. Open dump of Mahmood Booti has been found to affect the surrounding vegetation up to 800 m in dry summers and reducing to 400 m in winters, while averaging to a distance of about 650 m. Average thermal influence zone has been observed to have same radial extent of about 650 m varying between the minimum of 350 m in dry summer and maximum of 1000 m in winter. All the corresponding details of bio-indicators and temperature variations have also been discussed. In addition to this, the results and methodology of spatial analysis for Mahmood Booti dump of Lahore, Pakistan, surrounded by a heterogeneous land cover, have been compared with the main dumping facility of Faisalabad, Pakistan, which is surrounded by a homogeneous vegetation cover all around. This comparison yielded two main conclusions, first, the surrounding geography of an open MSW dump affects the severity of bio-thermal effects, in addition to waste age, characterization, pile etc. Second, GIS analysis for studying bio-thermal effects requires modification that varies for prevailing neighborhood land cover conditions of MSW open dumps. Use of remotely sensed data for monitoring dumped MSW is a good alternative but selection of proper GIS methodology, representing natural setting of phenomena is equally important as that of the accuracy of the remotely sensed data.

AB  - The timing of smolt migration is a key phenological trait with profound implications for individual survival during both river descent and the subsequent sea sojourn of anadromous fish. We studied relationships between the time of smolt migration, water temperature and light intensity for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and sea trout (Salmo trutta). During 2006-2012, migrating smolts descending the southern Norway River Storelva were caught in a rotary screw trap located at the river mouth. The date of 50% cumulative smolt descent correlated significantly with the date when the river temperature exceeded 8 degrees C for both Atlantic salmon and sea trout smolts. In 2010, smolts of both species were passive integrated transponder (PIT)-tagged, and the diel timing of their migration was precisely documented. The degree of night migration decreased in both species as the river temperature rose, and at temperatures above 12-13 degrees C, more smolts migrated during day than during night. A multinomial model was fitted for estimating temperature and species effects on probabilities of migration during night, daytime, dusk and dawn. Atlantic salmon smolts preferred migrating under lower light intensities than sea trout smolts during early, but not late spring when both species migrated during bright daylight. In accordance with the early-season tendency to migrate at night, Atlantic salmon smolts migrated more during darker hours of the day than sea trout. In both species, smaller smolts migrated under dark conditions than during light conditions. Most of the findings on thermal, light and temporal effects on the observed smolt migration pattern can be explained as adaptations to predation avoidance.

AB  - Extraction of DNA from non-invasive samples (feces) has been used increasingly in genetic research on wildlife. For effective and reliable genetic analyses, knowledge about which samples should be selected in the field is essential. For this reason, we examined the process of DNA degradation in feces of deer. We collected fresh fecal pellets from three wild deer living in a warm temperate forest. We then assessed the effects of time (3, 5, and 10 days) under three environmental conditions (on the forest floor, on exposed ground, and inside the laboratory) on the rates of correct genotyping (CG), amplification failure (NA), genotyping error among positive amplification (ER), false alleles (FA), and allelic dropout (AD) of 15 microsatellite loci. The rate of CG significantly decreased, and those of NA and FA increased with increasing lapse of time. Rates of CG tended to be highest and those of NA, ER, FA, and AD to be lowest in feces kept inside, followed by those on the forest floor. Suitability of samples for DNA extraction was lowest in fecal pellets left on exposed ground, and we suspect that rain may hasten DNA degradation. NA rate could serve as a reliable indicator of the quality of fecal pellets because it was significantly positively correlated with ER rate. For efficient genetic analyses using deer feces in warm temperate zones, we recommend collecting fecal pellets within 3 days of defecation, during periods without rainfall and from under the cover of trees.

AB  - Within the last decade, fully disposable centrifuge technologies, fluidized-bed centrifuges (FBC), have been introduced to the biologics industry. The FBC has found a niche in cell therapy where it is used to collect, concentrate, and then wash mammalian cell product while continuously discarding centrate. The goal of this research was to determine optimum FBC conditions for recovery of live cells, and to develop a mathematical model that can assist with process scaleup. Cell losses can occur during bed formation via flow channels within the bed. Experimental results with the kSep400 centrifuge indicate that, for a given volume processed: the bed height (a bed compactness indicator) is affected by RPM and flowrate, and dead cells are selectively removed during operation. To explain these results, two modeling approaches were used: (i) equating the centrifugal and inertial forces on the cells (i.e., a force balance model or FBM) and (ii) a two-phase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to predict liquid flow patterns and cell retention in the bowl. Both models predicted bed height vs. time reasonably well, though the CFD model proved more accurate. The flow patterns predicted by CFD indicate a Coriolis-driven flow that enhances uniformity of cells in the bed and may lead to cell losses in the outflow over time. The CFD-predicted loss of viable cells and selective removal of the dead cells generally agreed with experimental trends, but did over-predict dead cell loss by up to 3-fold for some of the conditions.

AB  - Rivers in arid and semiarid regions often traverse saline aquifers, creating buoyant freshwater lenses in the adjoining riparian and floodplain zones. The occurrence of freshwater lenses where the river is otherwise gaining saline groundwater appears counterintuitive, given that both hydraulic and density forces act toward the river. In this paper, an analytical solution is presented that defines the extent of a stable, sharp-interface terrestrial freshwater lens (in cross section) in a riverine environment that otherwise contains saline groundwater moving toward the river. The method is analogous to the situation of an island freshwater lens, except in the riverine setting, the saltwater is mobile and the lens is assumed to be stagnant. The solution characterizes the primary controlling factors of riverine freshwater lenses, which are larger for situations involving lower hydraulic conductivities and rates of saltwater discharge to the river. Deeper aquifers, more transmissive riverbeds, and larger freshwater-saltwater density differences produce more extensive lenses. The analytical solution predicts the parameter combinations that preclude the occurrence of freshwater lenses. The utility of the solution as a screening method to predict the occurrence of terrestrial freshwater lenses is demonstrated by application to parameter ranges typical of the South Australian portion of the River Murray, where freshwater lenses occur in only a portion of the neighboring floodplains. Despite assumptions of equilibrium conditions and a sharp freshwater-saltwater interface, the solution for predicting the occurrence of riverine freshwater lenses presented in this study has immediate relevance to the management of floodplains in which freshwater lenses are integral to biophysical conditions.

AB  - This article aims at evaluating linkages between selected local traditional knowledge (LTK) indicators with meteorological drought forecasting parameters in the Mzingwane catchment area of Zimbabwe. In addition, the article investigates possible ways of integrating selected LTK indicators with the meteorological drought forecasting parameters to improve applicability of meteorological drought forecasts at local level.
   LTK forecast data from trees and plants for 2012/2013 season was collected through structured questionnaires administered on 40 household heads. Monthly rainfall data spanning the period September 1999-May 2013 (14 years) were used for the calculation of Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) for the study catchment. The trends in drought severity scale were then compared to the results from local traditional knowledge drought forecasting (LTKIDF) to find out the degree to which they could be correlated. The GEONETCast ten day composite, SPOT VEGETATION, normalized difference vegetation index (S10 NDVI) dataset with a 1 km resolution was used to evaluate vegetation condition and hence track drought occurrence and severity. The trends in drought severity scale from NDVI were then compared to the results from LTKDF to establish the level of correlation. The analyses carried out shows a good correlation between traditional plant and tree indicators with resulting conditions captured as NDVI and SPI. The challenge on the LIME systems, however, was lack of historical data to ensure adequate analysis and comparison with meteorological data. The study therefore recommends continuous monitoring and standardisation of LTK data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conventional biomarker age indicators may not always give conclusive inferences for the age of an oil's source rock, particularly with regard to condensates, in which most of the key biomarkers are often too sparse to determine. It is possible that other compounds, reflecting changes in primary producer assemblages or depositional environment, can provide age indications in basins that have experienced a progressive change in conditions. The Norwegian Barents Sea provides an opportunity to evaluate this approach, although the gradual changes are punctuated by intervals of stratification, OAEs and extinctions. Partial least squares analysis was used to identify a number of apparently suitable parameters, to establish an age calibration from source rock extracts and then to apply it to a variety of oils and condensates from the Barents Sea. The resulting source age inferences are consistent with conventional age parameters for the normal oils, providing a degree of confidence in their applicability to the problematic condensates. In the main part of the Hammerfest Basin, oils of Jurassic origin dominate, whereas contributions from Triassic sources are suggested towards the margins, particularly in pre-Jurassic reservoirs. To the east, on the Norsel High and in the Nordkapp Basin, the main oil sources are suggested to be Early Triassic, although a Palaeozoic, possibly Permian, source is likely on the margin of the Finnmark Platform in well 7128/4-1. Among the novel parameters, the relative abundances of phytanyl arenes and diadrimanes appear to be controlled by diagenetic conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study was carried out in Vlora Bay, Adriatic Sea, to evaluate the environmental status and estimate the pollution of different contamination sources in this area. Vlora Bay is a half-closed bay, positioned from the mouth of the Vjosa River delta to Karaburuni Peninsula. The total dissolved metal concentrations (Cd, Cu, Cr, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) of seawater samples were analyzed by graphite furnace AAS after the pre-concentration with CHELEX-100. The samples from 8 stations of Vlora Bay coastal areas, Albania, were collected during February 2012.
   There is little information available regarding the nutrient and heavy metal contamination level of Vlora Bay. Our analytical data were subjected to statistical analysis. Good correlations between Ni and Pb; Mn and Zn; Fe and Zn; Hg and Zn were found. Statistical analysis of the data was carried out using EXCEL and MINITAB-15 package programs.
   Based on the heavy metals concentrations and UK standards for the protection of saltwater life (SACs Project 2001) [32], and Sweden Environmental Quality Criteria (2002) [33], the seawater quality of Vlora Bay is quite good. The levels of trace metals were found to be lower than the Swedish guidelines (Cu, Cr, Mn, Ni and Zn) for coastal water. The seasonal weather conditions of February were characterized by heavy rains, strong wind and high seawater waves. These conditions are distinguished as the main factors that affect the concentration of trace elements in coastal water of Vlora Bay during our monitoring period.

AB  - Spatial variation in the photophysiology of symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae) of the scleractinian coral Pocillopora damicornis was examined along an environmental gradient in the Whitsunday Islands (Great Barrier Reef) at two depths (3 m and 6 m). Chlorophyll a fluorescence of photosystem II (PSII) and PAR-absorptivity measurements were conducted using an Imaging-PAM (pulse-amplitude-modulation) fluorometer. Most photophysiological parameters correlated with changes in environmental conditions quantified by differences in water quality along the gradient. For example, maximum quantum yield (F(v)/F(m)) increased and PAR-absorptivity decreased as water quality improved along the gradient from nearshore reefs (low irradiance, elevated nutrients and sediments) to outer islands (high irradiance, low nutrients and sediments). For apparent photosynthetic rate (PS(max)) and minimum saturating irradiance (E(k)), the direction of change differed depending on sampling depth, suggesting that different mechanisms of photo-acclimatisation operated between shallow and deep corals. Deep corals conformed to typical patterns of light/shade acclimatisation whereas shallow corals exhibited reduced PSmax and Ek with improving water quality coinciding with greater heat dissipation (NPQ(241)). Furthermore, deep corals on nearshore reefs exhibited elevated Q(241) in comparison to outer islands possibly due to effects of sedimentation and/or pollutants rather than irradiance. These results highlight the importance of mesoscale sampling to obtain useful estimates of the variability of photophysiological parameters, particularly if such measures are to be used as bioindicators of the condition of coral reefs.

AB  - An investigation of contaminants and biological effects in mussels from Halifax Harbour, Nova Scotia, Canada, focused on a 6 kin section in the central most industrialized core of the harbour, where a site was previously identified as highly contaminated. The aim of the study was to compare the body burden of mussels in terms of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), dichlorophenyltrichloroethane (DDT family), coprostanol and elements, relative to biological parameters such as condition indices, sex ratio, survival time in air, and to biochemical indicators of mussels' health analysed in gills, digestive gland and gonad tissues. These markers are total sugar and lipid content of gonads, mitochondrial electron transport activity in digestive gland and gonad tissues, lipid peroxidation in gill, digestive gland and gonad tissues, and heme oxidase activity in the digestive gland. At the north western end of the area, near a major sewage effluent, shorter survival time, higher oxidative stress and metabolism, gonad electron transport activity, levels of coporostanol, PAH, p,p'-dichlorophenyldichlo-roethylene (p,p'-DDE), Ag, Cu, Fe and P were observed. At the opposite south eastern end, longer survival time, higher lipid content, lowest condition indices and concentrations of coprostanol, PAH and p,p'-DDE, but higher concentrations of Sn and Cd, were detected. On-going improvements to sewage treatment in Halifax Harbour, including construction of sewage treatment plants that will discharge into deeper parts of the central harbour, should improve inter-tidal mussels' health in our study area.

AB  - Located at the interface between the temperate westerly and sub-tropical climate systems, South Africa's winter rainfall zone (WRZ) is a key location in understanding Late Quaternary atmospheric circulation dynamics. Inactive eolian deposits in the WRZ, comprising pan-fringing lunette and coastal dunes, were investigated to establish their depositional ages and utility as paleoenvironmental indicators. The resulting optical luminescence chronology reveals episodic lunette accretion at 60,000-45,000 yr, 12,000-13,000 yr, 2800-2600 yr, 1200 yr, and < 1000 yr, with coastal dune ages clustering at 4100-4700 yr.
   Episodes of lunette and coastal dune accretion on the Agulhas Plain are temporally distinct, reflecting differing fundamental controls on their activity. Comparisons to previously published data also reveal that the lunettes differ in age from more ancient coastal eolianites. Lunette deposition is asynchronous between locations, reflecting the topographic and hydrological setting of the individual pans. In near-coastal settings, with limited surface recharge, lunette accretion appears to be at least partially controlled by sea level induced changes in groundwater levels. Those pans with more significant surface recharge (particularly from fluvial systems) may produce less ambiguous paleoenvironmental records, with pan status more strongly reflecting regional hydrological conditions. Lunette orientation is indicative of strong westerly winds during both the Pleistocene and Holocene. Lunette accretion would have been promoted by reduced on-shore moisture transport during the summer months, enhancing rainfall seasonality. Such conditions would have been promoted by increased continentality as the Agulhas Bank was exposed during low sea level stands. (c) 2005 University of Washington. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evolutionary biologists have shown much recent interest in the costliness and signal content of colorful plumage displays in birds. Although many studies suggest that both carotenoid- and structurally-based plumage colors are condition-dependent indicators of health and nutritional state at the time ornamental feathers are grown, there is little experimental evidence supporting the idea that melanin pigmentation is a reliable signal of condition during molt. Instead, melanin-based ornamental coloration often reveals the competitive ability and dominance of individuals throughout the year. However, this work does not indicate which proximate environmental factors shape the expression of melanin pigmentation at the time of feather growth. Because of the link between melanin coloration and the social environment, it is possible that the development of brightly colored plumage may be associated with aggressive social interactions during feather molt. Here, we show that melanin-based ornamental coloration in male house sparrows (Passer domesticus) is correlated with the degree to which individuals interact aggressively with conspecifics during molt. Males that were dominant (beta, but not alpha) within captive social groups during molt grew larger badges than subordinates. Groups of males that had higher rates of aggression during molt grew larger badges than less aggressive triads. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that melanin pigmentation and plumage-based status badges are related to the competitive history of individuals during feather development. By coupling badge size directly with aggressive experiences during molt, birds can use their status signal to honestly indicate their likelihood of winning agonistic encounters throughout the year.

AB  - The primary geoindicators appropriate for monitoring environmental changes in the humid tropics are transitory surface water levels, shoreline position, wetlands distribution, coral reefs, land-forms, and sediment sequence and composition. Lateral zonations and temporal successions of vegetation also can be used as geoindicators of riverine and shoreline changes. All of these coastal geoindicators are sensitive to regional tectonic processes and anthropogenic alterations and they typically reflect significant changes in coastal conditions such as fluvial processes, coastal energy, water quality, relative sea level, and sediment supply. Where humid tropical coasts coincide with active tectonic margins, indicators of seismic activity are critical to understanding coastal changes associated with co-seismic subsidence or uplift, tsunamis, and liquefaction of coastal sediments. Coastal landforms and sedimentary deposits that record late Quaternary environmental changes include perched fluvial and marine terraces, delta-plain morphologies, crevasses-play deposits, peats and other paleosols, beach ridges, mud capes, and mud volcanoes. Although these features and deposits typically reflect environmental changes spanning more than 100 years, they are relevant to modern processes, management of coastal lands and resources, and prediction of future conditions. In some regions of the humid tropics, large coastal areas are unaffected by hurricanes or typhoons. Nevertheless, these tropical coasts are vulnerable to other non-storm processes, such as El Nino events, tsunamis, and monsoons that increase water levels, and cause widespread flooding and beach erosion. The environmental and political significance of coastal geoindicators increases when they are integrated and applied to issues of human safety and health such as hazards mapping, risk assessment, and dispersion of contaminated sediments. However, to be relevant, those socio-environmental applications demand accurate predictions of future trends and rates of change.

AB  - The advent of conservation tillage presents a need for a greater understanding of plant disease and disease interactions in temperate humid agriculture, where excessive crop residues, continuous moist soil conditions and soil compaction are potential constraints. In this review, biotic and abiotic factors, and aspects of microbial antagonism, which can influence plant disease development in the root zone, are characterized in the context of conservation tillage in humid climates. Soil densification and reduction in macroporosity can aggravate abiotic root disease. Changes in soil aeration and permeability status can alter the quantitative and qualitative differences between soil rhizofloral populations, and survival and distribution of pathogen inoculum, Furthermore, anaerobic soil conditions can result in root-pathogen interactions leading to plant disease development. A good quality soil physical environment is an important indicator for root health under conservation tillage in humid climates.
   Conservation tillage tends to concentrate plant debris and consequently microbial biomass in the top 5 to 15 cm of soil, and thus promotes survival of pathogens. However, disease-causing microbes make up only a proportion of the rhizofloral population. Relatively high soil microbial activity can lead to competition effects that may ameliorate pathogen activity and survival, and counteract a high pathogen inoculum pressure. Microbial antagonism in the root zone can lead to the formation of disease-suppressive soils. This phenomenon, which is important for the adoption of conservation tillage in humid climates, can be influenced by soil and crop management practices, especially crop rotation.

AB  - Various types of agricultural and industrial waste have been used for biochar production. However, a consistent method of biochar stratification for agronomic and environmental purposes is still lacking. The aim of this study was to propose and evaluate a method of stratification based on physical and chemical properties. A set of biochar samples was produced by pyrolysis and co-pyrolysis from two agricultural wastes (poultry litter - PL and swine manure -SM) and three industrial wastes (construction wood - CW, tyres - TR and PVC plastic - PVC) at a wide range of pyrolysis temperatures (300-700 degrees C). The proposed stratification considered the following criteria in order: (i) construction of a biochar viability indicator (BVI); (ii) classification of biochar potential based on fixed carbon, ash and volatile matter; (iii) joint use of biochar quality criteria and those established in the literature (e.g. International Biochar Initiative - IBI); and (iv) the restrictive conditions of the environment where the biochar might be applied, in this case mining tailings, aiming at plant development. Using the proposed method of stratification, PL+CW pyrolysed at 300 degrees C was chosen for the recovery of Fe and Mn mining tailings due to its intermediate fertility level and extremely low risk of environmental pollution. The proposed method allowed the identification of restrictions on biochar use, and most importantly, highlighted the potential of the most viable biochars for conditioning mining tailings, which hinder plant growth. However, despite being useful and efficient in biochar selection, the proposed methods are still dependent on the physico-chemical characteristics of the biochars.

AB  - Increasing evidence for the effects of Holocene history on modern biotic communities suggests that current explanations of community patterns and conservation strategies require revisiting. Here we focused on Central European rich fens that are at high risk among mire habitats because of their relatively low environmental stability, and hence sensitivity to successional shifts. At each of 57 study sites, inventory of specialist species of bryophytes, vascular plants and land snails, measurements of local environmental conditions, area, and radiocarbon dating were conducted. We used Moran's I spatial autocorrelation, multiple linear regression models, MDS, db-RDA, and null models to identify drivers of species richness and occurrence. We tested the importance of site age and historical metacommunity dynamics expressed by regional age of the habitat for the diversity of three taxonomic groups of fen organisms differing in dispersal and life history strategies. The richness of specialist species was affected by local environmental conditions and area in all three groups, but the effect of regional age was significant and positive for vascular plants and snails, once the effect of fen area was set as a covariable. We identified 11 species significantly associated with ancient fens independently of site area and pH effects; this group includes species currently considered to be umbrella species in European habitat conservation (the moss Hamatocaulis vernicosus and the snail Vertigo geyeri). The effect of fen age per se on the communities of specialists calls for the incorporation of age into conservation schemes. Restoration or de novo construction of peat-forming fens cannot compensate for a loss of ancient fens.

AB  - In shallow eutrophic lakes, submersed macrophytes are essential for maintaining a clear water state, and they are affected markedly by fishes directly through herbivory and indirectly by fish-invertebrate-periphyton complexity, a pathway that presently is not well understood in subtropical lakes but probably vital to lake managements. We conducted a mesocosm study involving benthic fish (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus), snails (Radix swinhoei) and submersed macrophyte (Vallisneria natans), aiming to examine whether benthic fish is detrimental to reestablishment of clear-water macrophyte-dominated state in eutrophic degraded lakes. In addition, we aimed to investigate the cascading effect that benthic fish might have on periphyton and phytoplankton and to what extent snails can alleviate this effect. Our results showed that benthic fish promoted nutrient release from the sediment and thereby facilitated the growth of phytoplankton and periphyton, leading to reduced growth of submerged macrophytes due to shading. Snails consumed the periphyton attached on the leaves of macrophytes, thereby being beneficial to the plant growth, albeit it could not fully counteract the adverse effects from benthic fish. The water quality indicators in terms of nutrients concentrations, phytoplankton biomass and light extinction coefficient along the water column was affected primarily by benthic fish, followed by macrophytes and snails. To target a clear-water condition, the water quality was best at the presence of macrophytes alone or in combination with snails, and worst at the presence of benthic fish. Our results implied that the removal of benthic fish should be a useful ecological restoration method for rehabilitation of submersed macrophytes and water quality improvement in subtropic, eutrophic, shallow lakes following external nutrient loading reduction.

AB  - Urban energy systems often contain multiple optimization sub-objectives with different dimensions. They often need to be normalized in many multi-objective optimization problems. This process may result in the loss of trade-off characteristics of each sub-objectives. This paper introduces a novel indicator, relative optimization potential, to quantify the difference in sensitivity of sub-objectives to the trade-off process, which is easily ignored in previous studies. An integrated multi-objective optimization framework for urban energy systems with flexible decision-making approaches is further proposed to match the differentiated requirements of various scenarios. This framework includes a partial a posterior approach to tackle high-dimensional multi-objective optimization problems, which reduces the computational cost while obtaining equivalent or better results through a reasonable simplification of the decision process. Moreover, a results evaluation method consistent with the perspective of decision-making is proposed to improve the interpretability and consistency of the entire trade-off process. The case studies illustrate the preference characteristics of the proposed approach under different scenarios. And its feasibility is verified by the cross-sectoral planning problem of integrated energy system and building retrofit in different urban areas and scenarios. The proposed approach favors different subobjectives under different building environments, demand profiles and grid-connection conditions while seeking the maximization of overall relative benefits. Overall, the proposed approach can be applied flexibly in various optimization scenarios to rationally trade-off multi-objective according to different optimization conditions without causing a significant increase in computational cost. This study provides a new tool for multi-objective optimization of urban energy systems with different perspectives.

AB  - Climate change alters forest development pathways, with consequences for ecosystem services and biodiversity. As the rate of warming increases, ecosystem change is expected to accelerate. However, ecosystem dynamics can have many causes unrelated to climate (for example, disturbance and stand development legacies). The compound effects of multiple drivers remain largely unclear. Here, we assessed forest dynamics over 28 years at Berchtesgaden National Park (BGNP), Germany, quantifying the spatiotemporal patterns and unraveling the drivers of forest change. We analyzed high-density forest inventory data, consisting of three consecutive censuses of 3759 permanent sample plots (132,866 tree records in total). We used semi-variograms to analyze spatial patterns of change, and boosted regression trees to quantify the effect of 30 covariates on changes in nine indicators of forest structure and composition. Over the 28 years investigated, the forests of BGNP were becoming denser, structurally more complex, and more species rich. Changes in forest structure were more pronounced and spatially correlated on the landscape than changes in tree species composition. Change rates of all indicators increased over time, signifying an acceleration of forest dynamics since the 1980s. Legacies and climate were the most important drivers of change, but had diverging impacts. Although forest change accelerated with increasing temperature, high legacy levels typical for late development stages dampened it. We here provide evidence for accelerating forest dynamics in mountain forests of the Alps, with potentially far-reaching consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem processes. We highlight that unmanaged forest development toward old-growth conditions could counteract climate-mediated acceleration of forest change.

AB  - The hepatopancreas of decapod crustaceans is an organ which can act as indicator for digestive and metabolic parameters under different physiological and / or environmental conditions. However, biochemical studies on digestive and metabolic parameters of the hepatopancreas of euryhaline burrowing crabs such as Neohelice granulata from habitats with different diet compositions are still scarce. In the wild, adult males of N. granulata from Mar Chiquita Coastal Lagoon (Argentina) in mudflat habitat have diets with higher lipid and protein content than crabs from the saltmarsh, suggesting that diets could be an important factor influencing hepatopancreas activities. We tested this hypothesis here by exposing adult male crabs to a similar experimental diet and comparing hepatopancreas parameters for lipid components and protein metabolism between males from these two habitat types at different times (up to three months). At month 3, we noticed a decrease of the triglyceride concentration and lipase activity and an increase of protein concentration in crabs from the mudflat. In contrast, triglycerides and protein concentration did not change in crabs from the saltmarsh, while lipase activity decreased and levamisole insensitive AP increased at month 3. The results indicate that digestive and metabolic parameters in the hepatopancreas of crabs from habitats varying in diet content remain different, even if crabs are subsequently fed by a similar experimental diet. This suggests that specific intrinsic regulations of these hepatopancreas parameters could operate differently in each habitat and could not be changed by recent diet conditions.

AB  - Research Highlights: This paper presents a cross-city empirical study on micro-climatic thermal benefits of urban trees, using machine-learning analysis to identify the importance of several in situ measured tree physiognomy traits for cooling. Background and Objectives: Green infrastructure and trees in particular play a key role in mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effect. A more detailed understanding of the cooling potential of urban trees and specific tree traits is necessary to support tree management decisions for cooling our progressively hot cities. The goal of this study was to identify the influence and importance of various tree traits and site conditions. Materials and Methods: Surface temperature, air temperature at 1.1 m and at tree crown height, as well as wet bulb globe-temperature of shaded and fully sun-exposed reference areas, were used to study the cooling effect of seven different urban tree species. For all 100 individuals, tree height, crown base, trunk circumference, crown volume, crown area, leaf area index (LAI) and leaf area density (LAD) were measured. Measurements were conducted in the cities of Dresden, Salzburg, Szeged, and Vienna as representatives for middle European cities in different climate zones. Results: Beside site conditions, tree species, height, height of crown base, as well as trunk circumference, have a great influence on the cooling effect for city dwellers. The trunk circumference is a very valuable indicator for estimating climate regulating ecosystem services and therefore a highly robust estimator for policy makers and tree management practitioners when planning and managing urban green areas for improving the availability and provision of ecosystem services.

AB  - A Soil and Water Assessment Tool model (SWAT) was developed for the Cuenca Inde-pendencia, a 6992 km(2) watershed with a signif-icant seasonal climate situated in the semi-arid highlands of Guanajuato State in central Mex-ico. This area is dominated by agricultural land cover (43.32 %), followed by pasture (25.7 %). Good to very good results for the coefficient of determination (R-2, 0.66 similar to 0.89) and the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE, 0.65 similar to 0.88) were obtained during both the calibration and the validation periods, while the percent bias (PBIAS) was not so good as the former indicators, but with satisfactory to very good results. According to the projections of seven general circulation models (GCM) under Cou-pled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) for climate change prediction, the Cuenca Independencia may experience more precipitation and higher temperature under emission scenarios of Representative Con-centration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 for the mid-century period (2030 2059), as well as the end of this century (2070 2099), compared to the baseline condition (1970 1999). Potential evapotranspiration (PET) and real evapotranspiration (ET) are predicted to increase continuously. Both mean annual sur-face runoff and aquifer recharge are predicted to increase more rapidly under the condition of scenario RCP 8.5 than RCP 4.5. However, increasing demands of agricultural irrigation are expected to consume the larger water volume seeping into the groundwater system, making aquifer recovery unlikely through natural processes under the current water resources management framework.

AB  - Previous studies suggest that biochar has potential to benefit soil when used as an amendment, but only few studies have investigated how the different biochars affect the microbial activity of soil in a calcareous soil. Hence, to study the effect of the biochars obtained from wheat straw and cow manure and produced under different production conditions on two biological soil indicators, dehydrogenase activity and soil respiration, after 0, 60, and 120 days of incubation (DOI), an incubation experiment as a completely randomized design with factorial arrangement in three replicates was conducted in a calcareous soil. The results of the study showed that with increasing the pyrolysis temperature (300 and 500 A degrees C) and pyrolysis residence times (1, 3, and 6 h) of biochars, regardless of feedstock source, the dehydrogenase activity and soil respiration decreased. Both maximum activity of dehydrogenase (20.93 mu g TPF g(-1) 24 h(-1)) and maximum soil respiration (0.26 mg CO2 g(-1) 24 h(-1)) were found in the biochar produced from wheat straw at 300 A degrees C, and the residence time of 1 h at the level of 10 t ha(-1) and minimum of these soil biological traits was observed in control treatments (soil). Moreover, the maximum activity of dehydrogenase and soil respiration was observed in 60 DOI. Therefore, when applying biochar as an amendment for increasing microbial activity in calcareous soil, the production conditions of biochar, type of biochar, and long- and short-term effects of different biochars should be taken into consideration.

AB  - The study of ovule senescence in the ovaries of four sweet cherry cultivars ('Karina, 'Kordia, 'Regina and 'Summit) in the environmental conditions of West Serbia was carried out. Monitoring of ovaries was performed using the fluorescence microscopy method, on emasculated and pollinated flowers (cross-pollination variant), non-emasculated open-pollinated flowers (open pollination variant), and emasculated unpollinated flowers (unpollinated variant). In cross- and open pollination variants, the rate of unusual pollen tube growth in the ovary, fertilization percentage and fruit set were determined. The tendency in the appearance of fluorescence, as an indicator of ovule senescence, showed strong genotypic dependence. it was the most and the least pronounced in the ovaries of 'Kordia' and 'Regina', respectively, in all the flower categories. Investigation of unusual pollen tube growth, fertilization percentage and fruit set, considered from the aspect of ovule senescence and cultivars' behaviour as female (pollinated), pointed to their specific relations and complex dependence on the air temperature before and during the flowering. Flower emasculation and pollination also influenced ovule senescence, and this impact was unequal by genotypes, i.e. those having better ovule vitality in general, had also better ovule vitality in the conditions of emasculation, and pollination absence. The results imply different adaptation of cultivars to higher temperatures before and during the flowering, pointing to the further investigation related to the good adaptability of genotypes to air temperatures in reproductive sense, which is a basic indicator of good adaptability in general.

AB  - Actual nutrition state indicates a significant prevalence of polynutrient deficits in Ukraine. One of the key issues in the fight against alimentary-dependent diseases is monitoring of population 's nutrition status. Only reliable methods for assessing actual nutrition can provide reliable information about the nature of nutrition and establish a relationship with health state. Taking into account the abovementioned, the aim of our study was to compare the existing methods of studying nutrition and nutrition status of individuals or population groups to substantiate and develop a new universal, effective method for assessing nutrition and its subsequent approval. it has been found that existing methods for assessing human food consumption have its disadvantages and advantages and provide the opportunity to receive certain types of nutrition information. There is no single universal method that would allow to make comprehensive assessment of population's nutrition, including student youth. To solve this issue, we have substantiated and developed Cl questionnaire far assessing the nutrition of different population groups, including student youth, which has been evaluated and approved by specialists from leading institutions in the field of nutrition hygiene, gastroenterology and dietetics. Created survey questionnaire is a universal tool for collecting primary it fomation and providing an opportunity to assess the.social and welfare standards of respondents, working conditions and living conditions, the presence of hazard factors and bad habits, involvement in sports, anthropometric indicators, as well as it allows to assess the diet, drinking regime, main food product groups consumption, weight of portions, food handling methods, priority and benefits when choosing food, food intake places, which will be taken into account in the future to develop effective measures for the prevention of alimentary and alimentary-dependent diseases.

AB  - Clonal growth allows plants to spread horizontally and to establish ramets in sites of contrasting resource status. If ramets remain physiologically integrated, clones in heterogeneous environments can act as cooperative systems - effects of stress on one ramet can be ameliorated by another connected ramet inhabiting benign conditions. But little is known about the effects of patch contrast on physiological integration of clonal plants and no study has addressed its effects on physiological traits like osmolytes, reactive oxygen intermediates and antioxidant enzymes. We examined the effect of physiological integration on survival, growth and stress indicators such as osmolytes, reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) and antioxidant enzymes in a clonal plant, Fragaria orientalis, growing in homogenous and heterogeneous environments differing in patch contrast of water availability (1 homogeneous (no contrast) group; 2 low contrast group; 3 high contrast group). Drought stress markedly reduced the survival and growth of the severed ramets of F. orientalis, especially in high contrast treatments. Support from a ramet growing in benign patch considerably reduced drought stress and enhanced growth of ramets in dry patches. The larger the contrast between water availability, the larger the amount of support the depending ramet received from the supporting one. This support strongly affected the growth of the supporting ramet, but not to an extent to cause increase in stress indicators. We also found indication of costs related to maintenance of physiological connection between ramets. Thus, the net benefit of physiological integration depends on the environment and integration between ramets of F. orientalis could be advantageous only in heterogeneous conditions with a high contrast.

AB  - Building materials and their durability and aging are essential to the performance of buildings and their building physical aspects over time. Accelerated climate aging investigations are carried out in order to study the durability of various building materials in a substantial shorter time span than natural weather aging would have allowed. Climate parameters such as temperature that includes freezing/thawing cycles, relative air humidity, water spray amount, solar and/or ultraviolet (UV) radiation and exposure duration are controlled in different climate aging apparatuses. Various aging processes in building materials, aging both by natural and accelerated climate exposure, may be studied in an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) radiation analysis following the decomposition and/or formation of chemical bonds in these building materials and products.
   ATR-FTIR analysis of different building material samples exhibit various levels of experimental difficulties. In this investigation we have studied the FTIR spectra of climate-weathered wood, wood rot, mold fungus on wood, mold fungus on plasterboard, and plastic degradation by UV radiation. Both qualitative and quantitative results may be obtained by an ATR-FTIR analysis. In order to determine the aging progress and assess the effective lifetime of materials, components, or products, FTIR spectra should be recorded before, during, and after the climate aging. Hence, FTIR may be developed as an important tool to track the condition of various materials, components, and products during the lifetime of a building, and thereby applied as a tool for condition assessment, selection of maintenance intervals, and service life prediction of buildings.

AB  - The presence of the Mediterranean pond turtle Mauremys leprosa in the Ebre Delta (Catalonia, north-east Spain) is well documented after the late 1970s, when the first reptile distribution lists were published. Owing to the fact that the species was considered scarce, a reintroduction programme based on the release of individuals at sites with potential habitat suitability was launched. From 1999 to 2001, 234 turtles of different ages were released and subsequently monitored until 2007, in order to make a conservation diagnosis using five assessment criteria. These criteria were body condition, individual growth, reproduction, survival and population growth rate. Despite the relatively large number of turtles released, no viable population resulted from the programme. Assessment criteria suggested that: (1) released individuals showed good physical condition and satisfactory growth (the only positive results); (2) reproduction was almost absent; (3) local survival was reduced compared with that of Spanish wild populations of the species; (4) temporary emigration was high; (5) the growth rate of the population was negative. In conclusion, the results suggested that the habitat at the Ebre Delta marshes may not be favourable to the species, and that the scarce historical data record may indicate a relatively low-quality habitat; the few records may correspond to individuals dispersing from the river, a more suitable habitat. Thus, we conclude that historically scarce records may be the result of natural patchiness and heterogeneous distributions, and they are not necessarily a good indicator of relict, decimated populations. Good assessment criteria, as those proposed and used here, are necessary tools to assess results in reintroduction projects to recover endangered chelonian populations.

AB  - The Western Australian Rangeland Monitoring System (WARMS) consists of a set of similar to 1620 permanent sites distributed across the pastoral rangelands of Western Australia used for commercial livestock grazing. The system is designed to provide information to government and the general community on changes in Western Australia's rangelands, rather than to individual landholders. It is designed to report at the regional or vegetation type level by selectively sampling representative areas of the rangelands, with representation occurring at several levels. The system was fully implemented by 1999 and all sites, except a small number of ongoing replacements, have now been re-assessed at least once. Two site types are used. In grassland areas, the frequency of all perennial species is assessed, and an estimate made of crown cover of woody perennials. In shrubland areas, a direct census technique is used, with the demography and maximum canopy dimensions of all shrubs recorded. Changes in soil surface condition and patch distribution are also assessed using standard Landscape Function Analysis (LFA) techniques. The vegetation and soil surface information is used to indicate rangeland change. The system is not fixed within any single model of range dynamics and the outputs of WARMS can be interpreted in various ways, depending on the specific requirements of the end-user. The paper includes discussion of the institutional requirements for WARMS, the site stratification and selection criteria, description of the field methods used and the rationale behind its design. It also considers the implications of the site strati. cation and selection criteria in terms of the caveats that need to accompany reporting.

AB  - Upgrade of the emergy analysis of Secovlje saltpans [Babic, J., 2005. Emergy analysis of the salt production process at the Secovlje saltpans, Slovenia. In: Proceedings of the Third Biennial Emergy Analysis Research Conference, January 29-31, 2004. The Center for Environmental Policy, Gainesville, FL] was performed with STELLA programming language. STELLA model of the solar salt production process was constructed to simulate emergy flows and emergy indices. Sensitivity analysis of state variables with regard to various emergy indices was also performed. We compared several process scenarios as well as the process behavior under different environmental and economic conditions. The model structure enables adding new state variables in order to obtain better control over emergy flows within the model and between the model and its environment, Results show that evaporated water contributes the highest identified environmental renewable emergy inflow to the area. Precipitations themselves have very negative effect on actual salt production due to the dilution of concentrated brine with rainwater. However, human labor, as it is driven mostly by nonrenewable emergy, contributes the highest nonrenewable emergy inflow. The general trend of decreasing percentage of renewable emergy in human work as well as the need for additional inputs of nonrenewable emergy aimed at reducing labor demand, limits the possibilities to achieve a higher sustainability and a lower environmental loading of the investigated production process. The paper compares the effects of different process modifications and the effect of changing meteorological conditions to the indicators of environmental loading and degree of sustainability.

AB  - Nematode communities and the differences in microclimatic conditions were studied on three summits (attitude 1900-2250m a.s.l.) in the calcareous Alps of Austria (Styria). Family composition and trophic structure (feeding types) were assessed and were analysed for (1) between-summit variation, and (2) differences between summit plots facing the four compass directions, i.e. microclimate variation. Soil temperatures were recorded at all plots.
   The summits differed significantly in family composition in that the lowest summit strongly deviated from the other two summits similar in attitude. Total nematode abundance and diversity were similar, however, among summits (342-444 individuals per 100 g dry soil, 18-23 families per summit). Maturity indices (3.0-3.3) and the plant parasite indices (2.4-2.6) were also within a narrow range. The most pronounced result was that nematode abundances on the south or east facing side were higher, by a factor of 4, than on the northern and western sides. This pattern applied to most families and feeding types, albeit to varying degrees. Across all summits nematode diversity and family composition were correlated with winter temperature minima. Total nematode abundance, however, covaried with annual mean temperature and growing season duration within summits.
   We conclude that nematode assemblages are potentially good bioindicators of climate change. They reacted sensitively and predictably to microclimatic conditions, sampling techniques are inexpensive and well standardized. Furthermore, feeding types can be determined with minimal taxonomic skills and largely reflect results based on classification by family. (C) 2004 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - The biologically active molecules karrikinolide (KAR(1)) and trimethylbutenolide (TMB) present in wildfire smoke play a key role in regulating seed germination of many plant species. To elucidate the physiological mechanism by which smoke-water (SW), KAR(1), and TMB regulate seed germination in photosensitive 'Grand Rapids' lettuce (Lactuca sativa), we investigated levels of the dormancy-inducing hormone abscisic acid (ABA), three auxin catabolites, and cytokinins (26 isoprenoid and four aromatic) in response to these compounds. Activity of the hydrolytic enzymes a-amylase and lipase along with stored food reserves (lipids, carbohydrate, starch, and protein) were also assessed. The smoke compounds precisely regulated ABA and hydrolytic enzymes under all light conditions. ABA levels under red (R) light were not significantly different in seeds treated with TMB or water. However, TMBtreated seeds showed significantly inhibited germination (33%) compared with water controls (100%). KAR(1) significantly enhanced total isoprenoid cytokinins under dark conditions in comparison with other treatments; however, there was no significant effect under R light. Enhanced levels of indole-3-aspartic acid (an indicator of high indole-3-acetic acid accumulation, which inhibits lettuce seed germination) and absence of trans-zeatin and trans-zeatin riboside (the most active cytokinins) in TMB-treated seeds might be responsible for reduced germination under R light. Our results demonstrate that SW and KAR(1) significantly promote lettuce seed germination by reducing levels of ABA and enhancing the activity of hydrolytic enzymes, which aids in mobilizing stored reserves. However, TMB inhibits germination by enhancing ABA levels and reducing the activity of hydrolytic enzymes.

AB  - The occurrence of emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) in wastewaters and the inability of the conventional wastewater treatments plants to deal with them have been pointed out several times over the last few years. As a result, remnants of those compounds released into the aquatic environment present a potential risk for public health. Constructed wetlands (CWs) have been proposed as environmentally friendly, low-cost alternative systems with satisfactory results for different types of contaminants. This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of a CW system, planted with the halophyte Juncus acutus, to eliminate bisphenol A (BPA) and two antibiotics, namely ciprofloxacin (CIP) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX) under different operating conditions. The behavior of Escherichia coli and enterococcal populations in terms of changes in their resistance profile for the selected antibiotics and the abundance of two resistance genes (qnrA and sul1) were also examined. BPA and CIP were significantly removed by the CW, with an overall removal of 76.2% and 93.9% respectively and with the plants playing a vital role. In contrast, SMX was not significantly eliminated. Moreover, fluctuations in the antibiotic resistance profile of bacteria were observed. Treatment processes affected the response of the two selected bacterial indicators, depending on the conditions employed in each case. Furthermore, increased levels of resistance genes were monitored in the system effluent. This study indicates that CWs, as tertiary wastewater treatment systems, may demonstrate high removal rates for some but not all EOCs. This implies that each EOC identified in the feed stream should be tested assiduously by analyzing the final effluents before their reuse or discharge into water bodies.

AB  - Arcellinida (testate lobose amoebae) were examined from 22 surface-sediment samples collected from homogenous environments in eastern Canadian lakes (Lac du Castor Blanc, SW Quebec; Oromocto Lake, SW New Brunswick) to: 1) evaluate the faunal consistency of assemblages within the targeted environments; and, 2) assess the Arcellinida assemblage response evident in samples collected from Oromocto Lake in 2010 CE (n = 10) and 2012 CE (n = 6) to inter-annual changes in environmental conditions. Cluster analysis and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), redundancy analysis (RDA), and Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity Matrix (BCDM) were used to identify the dominant arcellinidan assemblages, determine physicochemical controls over the Arcellinida distribution, and assess the assemblages' faunal homogeneity, respectively. Cluster analysis, DCA, and BCDM results revealed two distinct and relatively homogenous arcellinidan assemblages: 1) Lac du Castor Blanc Assemblage; and 2) Oromocto Lake Assemblage, which could further be subdivided into Oromocto Lake 2010 CE (OL10), and 2012 CE (OL12) sub-assemblages. RDA results showed that 65.6% of the variance in the arcellinidan distribution could be attributed to four significant parameters; sand size fraction (32.1%), calcium (29.2%), manganese (2.7%), and organic content (1.5%). The OL10 and OL12 sub-assemblages aligned well with the respective sample collection dates of 2010 CE and 2012 CE, with proportions of the healthy-lake-indicating Diffluggiid taxa being higher in OL12, likely due to a concurrent slight increase in substrate organic content in the 2012 CE sediments. Our results confirm the faunal homogeneity of assemblages in limnologically similar environments, and demonstrate the rapid response of Arcellinida assemblages to changes in lake conditions at inter-annual time scales.

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of high biodiversity silvopastoral system (SPSnuclei) on microclimate and thermal comfort index thru a parallel with treeless pasture (TLP) during the four seasons of the year. Three conditions were determined for this study: shadowing area in SPSnuclei, sunny area in SPSnuclei, and sunny area in TLP. During two consecutive days in each season, the following microclimatic variables were collected: air temperature (degrees C), relative humidity (%), illuminance (lux), wind speed (m/s), and soil surface temperature (degrees C). The temperature and humidity index (THI) was calculated for each condition as indicative of thermal comfort. An influence analysis was carried out by generalized linear models to evaluate the system effects on the microclimatic variables. A confirmatory analysis was done with Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney. Systems (SPSnuclei x TLP) influenced the microclimatic variables and THI (p<0.05). The lowest means of air temperature, illuminance, wind speed, and soil surface temperature were found in SPSnuclei. As expected, autumn and winter presented a comfortable environment even on treeless pastureland. Only the SPSnuclei showed a comfortable environment for dairy production during spring. During summer, the TLP had a microclimate and thermal comfort index not suitable for dairy production already in the first hours of the day (THI between 79 and 85). We concluded that SPSnuclei provided better environment for pasture-based dairy production when compared to TLP. The high THI measured in TLP during summer could be a limiting factor on animal production.

AB  - In modern cities, life is primarily formed in interaction with various environmental, social, economic, infrastructural, hygienic, safety, political and cultural conditions. Urban quality of life (UQoL) is the result of such interactions. In general, both objective and subjective approaches are used in the study and modelling of UQoL. So far the studies have been conducted in forms of social and large-scale geographical studies mainly ignoring spatial differences of quality of life (QoL) in complicated urban environments. Moreover, QoL as one of the attributes of geographical environment is a dynamic and variable concept which has received little attention. Spatiotemporal modelling of this concept can contribute to monitoring the UQoL and planning for its improvement. The current study aims to develop a method for spatiotemporal modelling of UQoL. For this purpose, multi criteria decision making (MCDM) method and fuzzy logic are used. Moreover, given the variability of some indicators, temporal modelling of UQoL was conducted based on snapshot method in seasonal scale. In order to evaluate the proposed procedure, modelling of QoL was done at urban blocks scale in regions 3, 6, and 11 of Tehran, Iran. The results show the existence of a fairly regular pattern as an increase in desirability of UQoL from south to north of the area. The seasonal changes of UQoL show the improvement of environmental condition in spring and autumn compared to winter and summer. The result of sensitivity analysis shows the reliability of the modelling results. Since the effect of inputs on the fuzzy gamma output (2.5%) are less than the corresponding amount in VIKOR-fuzzy method (48%), it can be concluded that the output of fuzzy-gamma is more reliable.

AB  - Food choice has profound implications for the relative intakes of water and salts, and thus for an animal's physiological state. Discrimination behaviors with respect salt intake have been documented in a number of vertebrate species, but few studies have considered the ecological context in which they occur. Here, we report on the results of a 2-choice experiment designed to examine the influence of dietary salt content and freshwater availability in food discrimination behaviors in red knots Calidris canutus (Aves: Scolopacidae) that feed on mud snails Peringia ulvae (Gastropoda: Hydrobiidae) whose body fluids have either relatively low (25%) or high (42%) salinity. Birds ate more and spent longer time foraging on low-salinity mud snails when their salt gland sizes-an indicator of excretory capacity-were relatively small and when they were deprived of freshwater. However, as they enlarged salt glands-following a prolonged exposure to salty diet without access to freshwater-and regained access to freshwater, their preference for low-salinity prey disappeared. Such a change of preference illustrates the context dependency of discrimination. As the birds were able to maintain salt-water balance-inferred from plasma sodium concentration-under all conditions, changes in salinity preferences may occur without measurable physiological signs of osmotic stress. Our results highlight the importance of ecological context for understanding foraging responses. We argue that areas with high salinities could act as refuges for euryhaline invertebrates and fish from top vertebrate predators.

AB  - This study aimed to verify the capacity of Tradescantia pallida in the biomonitoring of air pollution in urban areas with different traffic intensities and under varying environmental conditions. Experiments were carried out in Ribeirao Preto, in the Southeastern Brazil, with more than 660,000 inhabitants and a fleet of more than 485,000 motor vehicles. Ten seedlings of T. pallida were exposed in three areas in the city, differing in traffic vehicle flow, in two seasons (wet and dry). At the end of each sampling period, which lasted 4 months, samples of leaves were collected, and the content of As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mg, Mn, P, Pb, S, andZnwas determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). The same elements were determined in soil samples for a seasonal characterization in conjunction with secondary data of environmental parameters. Additionally, micronucleus assay with early pollen tetrad cells of Tradescantia (Trad-MN) was conducted by collecting flower buds and analyzing the micronuclei frequencies in pollen mother cells. Although pollutant levels in air were below the Brazilian legal limits, plants exposed in the high-traffic flow area presented higher concentrations of elements related to vehicle emissions, especially under dry conditions, and higher micronuclei frequency in pollen mother cells. These results show the sensitivity of T. pallida to low-level urban air pollution and its suitability as bioindicator for trace elements. This alternative tool for biomonitoring can serve as a support methodology for the adoption of more restrictive public environmental policies in Brazil and extendible to other developing countries.

AB  - Fire in underground structures can result in devastating consequences in terms of both economic damage and loss of life. Hydro-electric plants are typically underground windowless structures. In an underground hydropower station, the busbar corridor connects the busbar layer in the main power plant with the main transformer chamber. This structure forms the channel that is crucial for electrical power transmission. In this paper, a computational method, Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), was carried out on a model of a two-story busbar corridor structure based on actual fire test results as a validation case. Twenty-four prediction conditions were taken into account to evaluate the original design of the exhausting system and optimize the busbar corridor modeled smoke control scheme. In those predictions five factors were varied: the heat release rate (HRR), the story height, the air change rate (ACH), the exhaust outlet positions and the airflow inlet positions. Since toxic compounds, especially carbon monoxide, endanger evacuating people in fire scenarios, the carbon monoxide (CO) concentration was reported and used throughout this study as an indicator of the safety of occupants in the corridor. Of the five varied factors it was found that the story height and the airflow inlets with natural ventilation influenced the smoke suppression and control. For the story height of 6.0 m, the filling time is 52 s more than the story height of 4.5 m. The CO concentration of opening set upstairs only is twice as much of the design condition. Opening set downstairs only can exhaust smoke faster for occupied area.

AB  - Gyptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia, and Toxoplasma gondii are waterborne protozoal pathogens distributed worldwide and empirical evidence suggests that wetlands reduce the concentrations of these pathogens under certain environmental conditions. The goal of this study was to evaluate how protozoal removal in surface water is affected by the water temperature, turbidity, salinity, and vegetation cover of wetlands in the Monterey Bay region of California. To examine how protozoal removal was affected by these environmental factors, we conducted observational experiments at three primary spatial scales: settling columns, recirculating wetland mesocosm tanks, and an experimental research wetland (Molera Wetland). Simultaneously, we developed a protozoal transport model for surface water to simulate the settling columns, the mesocosm tanks, and the Molera Wetland. With a high degree of uncertainty expected in the model predictions and field observations, we developed the model within a Bayesian statistical framework. We found protozoal removal increased when water flowed through vegetation, and with higher levels of turbidity, salinity, and temperature. Protozoal removal in surface water was maximized (similar to 0.1 hour(-1)) when flowing through emergent vegetation at 2% cover, and with a vegetation contact time of similar to 30 minutes compared to the effects of temperature, salinity, and turbidity. Our studies revealed that an increase in vegetated wetland area, with water moving through vegetation, would likely improve regional water quality through the reduction of fecal protozoal pathogen loads.

AB  - Indicator models of sexual selection predict that exaggerated traits communicate information about sender condition or quality to conspecific receivers. Environmental challenges have often been considered as one such condition that could be encoded in an ornamental trait, and there is now extensive evidence showing how different stressors (e.g., nutritional, parasitological, and environmental) impact sexual signal elaboration. One of the primary means of assessing stress is by quantifying glucocorticoid (corticosterone or cortisol (CORT)) levels. For many ornaments, CORT impairs trait expression; however, the evidence is limited and mixed for one of the classic honest signals in animals, ornamental carotenoid coloration. In a model species for studies of carotenoid ornamentation (the house finch, Haemorhous mexicanus), we examined the relationship between male plumage redness and feather CORT levels, which serve as an integrated measure of hormone concentration during feather growth. We measured CORT in both tail (melanin-containing) and breast (carotenoid-containing) feathers and found that CORT levels were not different between body regions, but they were negatively correlated with plumage hue, with redder birds having more CORT in feathers. Despite opposing traditional views on stress and ornamentation, our results actually corroborate three other studies showing positive relationships between carotenoid coloration and CORT levels. Though the molecular mechanisms underlying such a relationship are still unclear, our results suggest that CORT should not be considered as a simple indicator of individual quality but rather as a mediator of complex allocation decisions or signals of metabolic activity that could link up with more elaborate expression of ornamental traits.

AB  - The littoral site of Ifri Oudadane is one of the most important recently excavated sites in the Mediterranean Maghreb. The shelter presents Epipalaeolithic and Neolithic layers and therefore offers the possibility to investigate the Neolithic transition in the region. Besides introducing the archaeological context, this paper focuses on palaeobotanical data in order to reconstruct Holocene environmental change and human use of plant resources for the period c. 11 to 5.7 ka cal. BP. Results show intense landscape transformations resulting from anthropic and climatic factors. First human occupations start at the beginning of the Holocene with favourable conditions in this otherwise harsh semi-arid stretch of land. A wooded environment with evergreen sclerophyllous oaks and riparian forests is documented and exploited by hunter-gatherers. From c. 7.6 ka cal. BP farming activities are well attested together with significant human impact, herding pressure and a progressive decline of arboreal components. After 6.6 ka cal. BP conditions become less favourable and markers for aridity increase. Riparian taxa disappear (Alnus) or decrease (Fraxinus, Populus, Salix); shrubs (Tamarix) and grasses (Artemisia) increase with a degradation of forest into shrubland (macchia). During 6.6 and 6.0 ka cal. BP there is a general occupation gap in arid and semi-arid Morocco and evidence for that change is also found in the alluvial deposits of the Moulouya, NE Morocco. Indicators for food production decrease at the same time and the site is abandoned during the first half of the 6th millennium cal. BP.

AB  - Ecotoxicological laboratory tests (lower-tier tests) are fundamental tools for assessing the toxicity of pesticides to soil organisms. In this study, using these tests under tropical conditions, we quantified the impact of the insecticides imidacloprid, fipronil, and thiametoxam, and the fungicides captan and carboxin + thiram, all of which are used in the chemical treatment of crop seeds, on the survival, reproduction, and behavior of Eisenia andrei (Oligochaeta). With the exception of imidacloprid, none of the pesticides tested caused mortality in E. andrei in artificial soils. The LC50 of imidacloprid was estimated as 25.53 mg active ingredient kg(-1) of dry soil. Earthworm reproduction rates were reduced by imidacloprid (EC50 = 4.07 mg kg(-1)), fipronil (EC20 = 23.16 mg kg(-1)), carboxin + thiram (EC50 = 56.38 mg kg(-1)), captan (EC50 = 334.84 mg kg(-1)), and thiametoxam (EC50 = 791.99 mg kg(-1)). Avoidance behavior was observed in the presence of imidacloprid (AC(50) = 0.11 mg kg(-1)), captan (AC(50) = 33.54 mg kg(-1)), carboxin + thiram (AC(50) = 60.32 mg kg(-1)), and thiametoxam (AC(50) = >20 mg kg(-1)). Earthworms showed a preference for soils with the insecticide fipronil. Imidacloprid was the most toxic of the substances tested for E. andrei. The avoidance test was the most sensitive test for most pesticides studied, but results varied between pesticides. These results offer new insights on the toxicity of pesticides used to treat seeds in tropical regions. However, they should be complemented with higher-tier tests in order to reduce the uncertainties in risk assessment. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Global change puts an increasing pressure on tropical forests and their inherent diversity by the risk of longer droughts and drier microclimatic conditions within the forest. How organisms will respond is uncertain, especially for organisms highly depending on their microclimatic environment such as bryophytes. An adequate tolerance to desiccation is important to face these changes, however, little is known for tropical bryophytes. We investigated for the first time the desiccation tolerance of epiphytic bryophytes from contrasting microsites at the tropical lowland forest in French Guiana. Using chlorophyll-fluorescence (F-v/F-m) as an indicator of recovery, we tested: (1) desiccation tolerance for short (3 d) and long (9 d) desiccation events; (2) different desiccation intensities; and (3) recovery by rehydration with water vapor. Species from the canopy were well adapted to desiccation events. Thirteen of 18 species maintained more than 75 percent of their photosynthetic capacity after recovery at the strongest desiccation treatment of 9 d at 43 percent relative humidity (RH). In contrast, species from the understory were sensitive and withstood desiccation only at humid conditions of 75 percent RH and higher. The photosystem of the studied bryophytes was reactivated efficiently in equilibration with water vapor only-a yet neglected phenomenon in bryology. A novel introduced desiccation tolerance index allows global comparison of desiccation tolerances and highlights the sensitivity of understory species. Our results suggest that decreasing humidity caused by climate change and forest degradation could be a concerning threat for understory species.

AB  - Biology-related indicators do not usually depend on just one meteorological element but on a combination of several weather indicators. One way to establish such integral indicators is to classify the general atmospheric circulation into a small number of circulation types. The aim of present study is to analyse connections between general atmospheric circulation and potato crop yield in Estonia. Meteorologically possible yield (MPY), calculated by the model POMOD, is used to characterise potato crop yield. Data of three meteorological stations and the biological parameters of two potato sorts were applied to the model, and 73 different classifications of atmospheric circulation from catalogue 1.2 of COST 733, domain 05 are used to qualify circulation conditions. Correlation analysis showed that there is at least one circulation type in each of the classifications with at least one statistically significant (99%) correlation with potato crop yield, whether in Kuressaare, Tallinn or Tartu. However, no classifications with circulation types correlating with MPY in all three stations at the same time were revealed. Circulation types inducing a decrease in the potato crop yield are more clearly represented. Clear differences occurred between the observed geographical locations as well as between the seasons: derived from the number of significant circulation types, summer and Kuressaare stand out. Of potato varieties, late 'Anti' is more influenced by circulation. Analysis of MSLP maps of circulation types revealed that the seaside stations (Tallinn, Kuressaare) suffer from negative effects of anti-cyclonic conditions (drought), while Tartu suffers from the cyclonic activity (excessive water).

AB  - A simple. precise and accurate method for the simultaneous determination of four UV filters and five polycyclic musks (PCMs) in aqueous samples was developed by solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS). The operating conditions affecting the performance of SPME-GC-MS, including fiber thickness, desorption time. pH. salinity, extraction time and temperature have been carefully studied. Under optimum conditions (30 mu m PDMS fiber, 7 min desorption time. pH 7, 10% NaCl, 90 min extraction time at 24 degrees C). the correlation coefficients (r(2)) of the calibration curves of target compounds ranged from 0.9993 to 0.9999 The limit of detection CLOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) ranged from 0 2 to 9.6 ng L(-1) and 0.7 to 32.0 ng L(-1), respectively The developed procedure was applied to the determinations of four UV filters and five PCMs in river water samples and internal standard was used for calibration to compensate the matrix effect Good relative recoveries were obtained for spiked river water at low, medium and high levels. The proposed SPME method was compared with traditional SPE procedure and the results found in river water using both methods were in the same order of magnitude and both are quite agreeable.

AB  - The evidence for climate change is increasing, and global warming could lead to the extinction of some species. Here we estimated the extinction risk of six high-montane species of different taxonomic groups (fern, vascular plant, wood-inhabiting fungus, mollusk, saproxylic beetle, and bird) by modeling their occurrence under two global warming scenarios. We also assessed the cross-taxon indicator suitability of the selected species for monitoring climate change in low-mountain-range forests in southeastern Germany (Bavarian Forest National Park). We tested the influence of temperature and other habitat variables by applying semi-parametric spatial generalized linear models with binomial error. The probability of occurrence for each species under the present conditions and under two conditions of global warming was calculated. To assess the cross-taxon suitability, we tested the predictability of the final generalized linear models for each species using the measured occurrence of the other selected species and a discrimination technique. We identified temperature as the main driver for all selected high-montane species. Our statistical models predict a considerable risk of extinction of these species within the Bavarian Forest National Park as a result of global warming. Our discrimination model indicates that these species have essentially similar relationships with the environment and that five of the six species are suitable as indicators of early signs of global warming. The choice of which indicators to use should involve a consideration of the type of monitoring systems already in place. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this review was to address the basis for and prevention of selected diseases (fatty liver, ketosis, rumen acidosis and displaced abomasums) that are feeding- and management-related and frequent in periparturient cows. The focus has been to discuss (1) the general physiological regulation and adaptations that are believed to be important for a successful transition to lactation, (2) for each disease the disease incidence rate, risk factors, aetiology and pathophysiology and (3) feeding and management strategies to prevent diseases. Unfortunately, few studies have documented prevention strategies and they consequently need to be developed based on risk factors and knowledge of the aetiology of the diseases. Strategies to prevent these diseases are therefore based on major factors directly or indirectly increasing the risk of fatty liver, ketosis, acidosis and displaced abomasum-factors such as over-conditioning at calving, excessive mobilisation of body fat, low nutrient intake, nutrient or diet specific factors and management and environmental stress. Finally, thoughts are presented on how prevention potentially could be improved in the future. It is suggested that there should be greater focus on individual animals in order to identify "risk animals". Status-oriented strategies for optimising dairy cow health, reproduction and production are suggested that aims at securing a desirable status of epithelia, metabolism and immune function in different cells, tissues or organs through surveillance and health and production management based on indicators.

TI  - On the autoregressive nature of Arctic sea ice concentrations
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
LA  - English
AB  - Many general circulation model experiments show amplified warming in the polar regions as one of the strongest responses to enhanced atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. In light of this, there has been speculation that a spatially coherent pattern of high-latitude temperature trends and associated cryospheric responses could be early indicators of climatic change. Although considerable effort is being made to examine the linkages between atmospheric anomalies and the sea ice regime, the month-to-month and year-to-year variations of Arctic sea ice remain poorly understood and insufficiently modelled.
   Ice persistence and thermal inertia suggest that month-to-month sea ice concentrations are strongly correlated e.g., present conditions are a reliable indicator of future conditions - but this has never been proven statistically. We use statistical times series analysis to characterize the variability of monthly Arctic sea ice concentrations from a nine-year satellite passive microwave record acquired between 1978 and 1987. Our focus is on documenting the autoregressive nature of the ice cover rather than identifying climatically significant changes. Interestingly, we find that only 62% of the Arctic sea ice zone is adequately represented by first-order autoregressive models, meaning that the sea ice concentrations in any given month are closely related to that of the preceding month. For the remaining 38% we identify, a variety of AutoRegressive - Moving Average (ARMA) time series models that differ from our geophysical expectations.
   Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the cryospheric processes at work in the Arctic. They can lead to the development of better sea ice models and be used to develop ice concentration forecasts with statistical confidence. Our results also identify those polar regions where climatically-induced changes may be most prevalent in the future.

TI  - Sources of water to wells for transient cyclic systems
T2  - GROUND WATER
LA  - English
AB  - Many state agencies are currently (1995) developing wellhead protection programs. The thrust of some of these programs is to protect water supplies by determining the areas contributing recharge to water-supply wells and by specifying regulations to minimize the opportunity for contamination of the recharge water by activities at the land surface. The area contributing recharge to a discharging well is the surface area at the water table through which the water flowing to the well entered the ground-water system. In the analyses of ground-water flow systems, steady-state average conditions are commonly used to simplify the problem and make a solution tractable. However, recharge is usually cyclic in nature, with seasonal cycles and longer term climatic cycles. The effect of these cyclic stresses on the area contributing recharge to wells is quantitatively analyzed for a hypothetical alluvial valley aquifer system that is representative of a large class of ground-water systems that are extensively developed for water supply. The analysis shows that, in many cases, these cyclic changes in the recharge rates do not significantly affect the location and size of the areas contributing recharge to wells. The ratio of the mean travel time to the length of the cyclic stress period appears to be an indicator of whether the transient effects of the cyclic stress must be explicitly represented in the analysis of contributing areas to wells. For the cases examined, if the ratio of the mean travel time to the period of the cyclic stress was much greater than one, then the transient area contributing recharge to wells was similar to the area calculated using an average steady-state condition. However, cyclic stresses on systems with ratios less than one do have an effect on the location and size of the areas contributing recharge to wells.

AB  - Plant invasions change the landscape in unprecedented ways, influencing not only local wetland native biodiversity but also the regional homogenization of plant communities. Freshwater wetlands are particularly vulnerable to invasive plant impacts, but few studies provide a longitudinal assessment encompassing native biodiversity, plant invasions, and anthropogenic disturbance. We investigate the effects of invasive plant richness and abundance on wetland native biodiversity in 16 temperate, freshwater wetlands in central Pennsylvania. We calculate several commonly used plant community structure and wetland condition indices by site and sampling period across a 20-year timeframe. Results indicate that environmental stimuli had a significant impact on invasive plant abundance through time. Native plant richness and abundance was influenced more by shrub richness, non-native plant cover, and environmental stressors than by invasive plant dominance. This relationship was made evident by the high rate of dominant species turnover and prevalence of dominant native species. If an invasive plant dominated a wetland site, it was replaced by a different dominant native and/or invasive plant in 10 to 15 years, a key finding that relates to the replacement rate of dominant species in the herbaceous layer. This discovery suggests that under certain conditions, invasive plants may provide the necessary means by which a system can recover from a disturbance, which historically goes against the current dogma in the scientific community. Moreover, this supports the idea that some invasive plants serve as a type of secondary pioneer species of succession, aiding in the development of a more stable and biodiverse system over time.

AB  - Ionomic profiling of plant tissues aims to understand the role of genetic factors and external conditions in mineral nutrient composition. However, little is known about the time-course changes occurring in these profiles during plant growth. The influences of genotype, environment, and management factors are not well understood. To clarify the variation in time-course data and to identify factors influencing these changes, we analyzed the ionomic leaf profiles of nine rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars, from transplantation to harvest, under different environmental conditions. An ANOVA was conducted separately for each element to elucidate the main effects of cultivar, fertilization, and growth stage, which were highly significant for all the elements observed except fertilization. The growth stage was the most significant for all elements except B. Conversely, the fertilization effect was not significant in half of the elements studied (Li, B, Na, Mg, P, S, K, Ca, and Cd). The elements during the growth stage were relatively stable across the environments and cultivars studied. To investigate the relationship between the changing pattern and the growth stage, we predicted the growth stage of rice based on the ionomic profile leaves using a machine learning model. Over 80% of the plants in this study were correctly classified into their growth stages with 10-fold cross-validation using the random forest model, with a highly significant contribution of the essential macronutrients P, Ca, S, Mg, and K as explanatory variables, indicating that they could be important indicators of the growth stage of rice plants.

AB  - Lack of color in the skin of red table grape varieties is a serious problem in areas of warm climate. This problem is often addressed by the application of ethylene release products such as ethephon. Strict regulation in the use of this product in EU forces European grape producers to look for suitable alternatives. With the aim to increase red skin color, we applied regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) strategies from veraison until harvest on "Flame Seedless" table grape vines cultivated under nets and under a plastic greenhouse in South East Spain, and compared yield and fruit quality with vines fully irrigated under the same net and plastic greenhouses. Our results show a modest improvement in the percentage of commercial clusters with better skin color, probably because the short duration of the deficit irrigation period only caused a slight decrease in soil water content and a mild water stress in RDI vines. Larger differences were observed under the more limiting conditions of the plastic greenhouse for light environment, especially when berry skin color was measured by CIRG (color index of red grape). More noticeable effect of RDI was noted on fruit earliness. Water savings were also remarkable. Negative effects of RDI on berry size or total soluble solid content were not perceived. Our results suggest that RDI is a suitable strategy to save irrigation water without substantial negative effects on yield and berry size. However, the effects on skin color were insufficient in the trial conditions.

AB  - The Ural Mountains (the Urals) are a mountain range on the border between the continents of and . The Urals extend about 2500 km from north to south and run from the coast of the Arctic Ocean to the steppe of northwestern Kazakhstan. In terms of mycorrhizal traits, the vegetation of the Urals has not been studied absolutely compared with the other mountain systems of Europe. Detailed research of vegetation at the Telpos-iz Ridge (Northern Urals, Russia) allowed us to analyze changes in mycorrhizal status (obligatory mycorrhizal, OM; facultative mycorrhizal, FM; non-mycorrhizal, NM) and type (arbuscular, AM; ectomycorrhiza, ECM; ericoid, ERM; ORM, orchid mycorrhiza; NM) both in the main vegetation types and the individual communities along the elevation and ecological gradients based on 165 releves. This is the first attempt to describe the mycorrhizal status of plant communities across different elevations and ecological conditions outside Europe and North America. OM species were most diverse in all vegetation types. Maximal share of NM species was found in the mires and may be explained by over logged and unfertile soils of these habitats. Arbuscular mycorrhizas dominated across all vegetation types except for mires, where specific ecological conditions result in the prevalence of ECM and NM species. We analyzed the mycorrhizal status and type of plant communities along the main ecological gradients and found a decisive role of elevation and soil nitrogen content. At the same time, it remains unclear which factor determines the distribution of ECM and AM communities which are most represented in the vegetation of the study area.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine temporary impacts of different fertilization systems on some labile soil biochemical and biological properties following potato monocropping under arid conditions. Field and incubation experiments were conducted to determine specifically soil organic carbon (SOC); dissolved organic carbon (DOC); dissolved organic nitrogen (DON); microbial biomass C (C-mic), N (N-mic), P (P-mic); bacterial and fungi counts; soil resistance index (SRI); net N mineralization (N-min); and some enzyme activity. Levels of SOC; DOC; N-min, C-mic, P-mic; bacteria and fungi counts; and soil respiration (SR) were significantly increased under organic and integrated fertilization systems compared with inorganic nano or NPK fertilization system, while levels of microbial biomass N (N-mic) and DON were markedly increased under nano or fertilizers compared to organic or integrated (organic + inorganic) fertilizers. By contrast, higher values of metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) were recorded in nano or fertilizer treatments suggesting that microbial biomass was less efficient under high maintenance of soil carbon. Enzyme activities of dehydrogenase (DH), beta-glucosidase (beta G), and acid phosphatase (Ac-P) were in the order of organic > integrated > inorganic fertilization systems, while enzyme activity of urease (UR) was in the vice versa order. Integrated fertilization system recorded greater levels of SOC; DOC; N-min, C-mic, P-mic; and SR relative to inorganic fertilizers even though applied at lower rates. It is, therefore, important for soils under monocropping system to poise organic and inorganic fertilization system that enhances soil health and soil organic matter build-up.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to establish thermal processing validation of tender coconut water by using SYBR green Real time PCR assay for direct detection of the biological indicator bacteria, B. cereus, a frequent cross contaminant in packaged tender coconut water. Nucleotide sequences coding for the hemolytic enterotoxin hemolysin BL (Hbl) widely associated with B. cereus food poisoning was used as the target gene for the real time PCR assay. Specific amplification was observed with B. cereus when the specificity of the assay was examined using other closely related spore forming food spoilage Bacilli. The present real-time PCR assay provides a detection of limit (LOD) of 10(3) CFU/ml of tender coconut water. The thermal resistance of B. cereus (ATCC 14579) was found that D-95 2.46 min and Z value 10.45 degrees C in tender coconut water. To validate the thermal processing conditions, B. cereus was artificially contaminated into coconut water, which was thermally processed and checked with real-time PCR assay to detect the survival of B. cereus in tender coconut water bottles without pre-enrichment. The bacterial load enumerated by the real-time PCR assay correlated with the time consuming standard conventional culture method. The thermal processing of tender coconut water packed in polypropylene bottles was validated with 6D concept and minimum 18 min of process time is required to achieve sterilization value (F-value) of 15. The product was analyzed for its physical, chemical properties and commercial sterility after the validated processing conditions and products were acceptable for 6 months without preservative.

AB  - Open pine ecosystems of the southern United States are a conservation priority for many agencies, organizations, and private landowners. These woodlands, characterized by moderately-stocked overstories, low cover of midstory, and grass-dominated herbaceous groundcover, provide important habitat for a suite of rare and declining wildlife species. To provide guidance for land managers engaged in habitat restoration in open pine ecosystems, ranges of desired conditions for elements of vegetation structure have been developed using literature survey and expert opinion. We compared empirical data on habitat occupancy for 17 wildlife species from second-growth longleaf pine woodlands in southwestern Georgia with recommended ranges for basal area (BA) of all pine, BA of pine a 35.5 cm dbh, percent canopy cover, percent herbaceous cover, and percent shrub cover. Vegetation data were taken from 864 monitoring plots and Mahalanobis distance models were used to develop habitat suitability indices from the wildlife data. Recommendations for shrub cover and BA of pines a 35.5 cm fit well with model predictions for all wildlife species. However, mean BA of all pines at sites used by wildlife were at the low end of the recommended range. Herbaceous cover at sites used by wildlife was well below the recommended range, whereas canopy cover was well above recommendations, suggesting these ranges should be expanded. These modifications could provide managers of open pine ecosystems greater flexibility, allowing them to incorporate a broader suite of objectives in their management while still providing habitat for wildlife species of concern. Moreover, our models suggest that monitoring presence of open pine indicator bird species may be an efficient method to assess restoration or management progress of open canopy pine systems.

AB  - Agriculture intensification and the use of pesticides have led to biodiversity loss due to soil toxic compounds. Thus, soil contamination studies are important to understand the negative effects in the physicochemical interactions. The use of biomarkers through bioindicators is a useful tool for assessing toxicity in agricultural environments complemented with the determination of pesticides. The objectives of this study were to determine the presence of organochlorine (OCPs) and organophosphate (OPPs) pesticides and the soil's potential toxicity in agricultural fields with different crops from the center of Quintana Roo State, using a set of enzymatic biomarkers (BMs), such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione-S-Transferase (GST), and catalase (CAT) on earthworms (Eisenia fetida). Earthworms were exposed for 96h on nine different agricultural soils as well as on a reference soil from a conservation area. Within all samples of soils, only OCPs were detected in low concentrations (ranged from non-detected to 1.40ppm). However, no correlation was observed between these pesticides and the BMs activity. AChE and CAT activity was significantly inhibited in at least one agricultural soil if compared to the conservation area, while no significant differences of GST were observed. The AChE activity observed suggests the presence of anticholinergic substances (that were neither detected nor determined analytically) in the sampled soils. The characterization of oxidative stress BMs was not correlated with the OCPs analyzed. Our results demonstrate that further studies of toxicity under field conditions are required, given the complexity of environmental conditions outside the laboratory.

AB  - The study establishes the peculiarities and characteristics of how world organic agricultural market develops and functions. The factors of demand and supply of organic agricultural products are singled out. Specific factors influencing the price of organic products, which should take into account the differences in yield and productivity, the need for crop rotation, the risk of harvest loss and loss in storage, and the cost of R&D are also identified. In modern conditions, prices for organic products are higher than for traditionally produced agricultural products, but the demand for organic products increases, taking into account their impact on human health. The research provides the analysis of market indicators dynamics and levels of organic markets development in comparison with different countries. The influence of institutional systems development that guarantees the quality of organic products in different countries is identified. We discovered the conditions for the development of the organic products market and systematized them into the following groups: organizational and legal, financial and economic, technological and socio-psychological. We identified the prospective directions of the organic products market development, related to the financial mechanisms of investment improvements; strengthening the agricultural producers' rights protection; ensuring food security; improving the system of customers' information; and research conduction. We proved that a systematic approach to the production development on an investment-innovative basis, creation of an institutional environment, sustainable development of rural territories, development and implementation of strategies for the development of vertically integrated structures, taking into account territorial differentiation, is needed for the development of organic agricultural products market.

AB  - Restoration of highly degraded urban coastal waters often requires large-scale, complex projects, but in the interim, smaller-scale efforts can provide immediate improvements to water quality conditions for visitor use. We examined short-term efforts to improve recreational water quality near the Grand Calumet River (GC) in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Identified as an Area of Concern (AOC) by the International Joint Commission, the GC has experienced years of industrial and municipal waste discharges, and as a result, coastal beaches have some of the highest rates of beach closings (>70%) in the United States. Project objectives were to identify sources of microbial contamination and to evaluate a short-term management solution to decrease beach closings: during 2015 (partial) and 2016 (season-long), canines were used to deter gull presence. Water samples were analyzed for Escherichia coli in 2015 and 2016, and fecal sources were evaluated using microbial source tracking markers (2015): human (Bacteroides HF183, Methanobrevibacter nifH), gull (Gull2), and dog (DogBact). Hydrometeorological conditions were simultaneously measured. Results indicated that human, gull, and canine fecal sources were present, with gulls being the dominant source. Escherichia coli densities were highly correlated with number of gulls present, Gull2 marker, and turbidity. Gull deterrence decreased E. coli and Gull2 marker detection during 2015, but numbers rebounded after program completion. The full-season program in 2016 resulted in lower E. coli densities and fewer beach closings. Large-scale restoration efforts are underway at this location, but short-term, small-scale projects can be useful for reducing beach closings and restoring ecosystem services.

The sedimentary record, encompassing the last 10 kyr, was studied for sediment texture and for the n-alkanes composition of organic matter (OM). Sediments rich in OM and bivalve shells accumulated during the period of sea-level rise, mostly in an intertidal environment of mangrove forest, mudflat and subtidal estuarine flood delta. The characterization of n-alkanes (C-10-C-33) and lignin methoxyphenols by means of direct analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC/MS) technique allowed determining the sources of the extant OM. Downcore fluctuations were observed in n-alkanes and in several n-alkane based indices, such as long chain carbon preference index (CPI C-24-C-33), long to short chain ratio (L/S) and average chain length (ACL), as well as in the relative proportion of lignin derived compounds. The n-alkanes distribution points to changing sources of OM input to the estuarine sediments over most of the Holocene period. Major inputs of terrestrial vegetation alternated with periods of mixed input from aquatic macrophytes as the rate of sea-level rise changed over time. The n-alkanes distribution and the lignin markers were useful for reconstructing paleoenvironmental conditions, particularly during the early Holocene when the lower Potengi River valley (now an estuarine area) could accommodate terrestrial forest vegetation before switching to halophytic mangroves as sea levels rose.

AB  - Understanding the distribution and abundance of organisms can be exceedingly difficult for pelagic fish species that live in estuarine environments. This is particularly so for fish that cannot be readily marked and released or otherwise tracked, such as the diminutive delta smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus, endemic to the San Francisco Estuary. The environmental factors that influence their distribution operate at multiple scales, from daily tidal cycles and local perceptual fields to seasonal and annual changes in dominant environmental gradients spanning the entire San Francisco Estuary. To quantify scale-specific patterns and factors shaping the spatiotemporal abundance dynamics of adult delta smelt, we fit a suite of models to an extensive, spatially resolved, catch survey time series from 13 annual cohorts. The best model included cohort-specific abundance indicators and daily mortality rates, a regional spatial adjustment, and haul-specific environmental conditions. The regional adjustment identified several density hot spots that were persistent across cohorts. While this model did include local environmental conditions, the gain in explained variation was relatively slight compared to that explained by the regional adjustment. Total abundance estimates were derived by multiplying habitat volume by catch density (design-based) and modeled density (model-based), with both showing severe declines in the population over the time period studied. The design-based approaches had lower uncertainty but potentially higher bias. We discuss the implications of our results for advancing the science and improving management of delta smelt, and future data collection needs.

AB  - The sugar-accumulating potential of global and local sweet and grain sorghum varieties were tested under the local conditions. The basis for this study was the dependency of sugar accumulation on temperature and photoperiod. Thus, the efficacy of cultivars as a bioenergy source would need to be determined based on their performance under the local environmental conditions. A strong correlation of sucrose content with brix was observed, enabling large-scale screening of varieties for high sucrose content. The morphological characteristics inherent in sweet sorghum, such as tall stems, greater number of leaves and a longer vegetative period, were found to correlate with the total stem sugar content. Assessment of sugars along the stem revealed maximum sugar accumulation in the upper intermediate to upper internodes in most of the varieties tested. The maximum theoretical ethanol yield (MTEY), a function of brix and juice yield, was determined as a better indicator of testing the performance of a variety as a potential source of bioethanol, mainly due to a negative correlation of stem juiciness and sucrose content in the varieties tested. Further, the relative expression of vacuolar invertase genes, SblNV1 and SblNV2, was studied, and a strong negative correlation of SblNV2 to stem sucrose content was observed. This reveals a possibility of involvement of vacuolar invertase gene, SblNV2, in sugar accumulation in sweet sorghum stems, and as a key candidate for molecular breeding studies for higher stem sugar content.

AB  - Given that phytoplankton and zooplankton communities have served as key ecological indicators of anthropogenic and other perturbations, a high-resolution Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) based Integrated Compartment Model (FVCOM-ICM) was implemented to investigate plankton dynamics with the inclusion of dreissenid invasion in Lake Erie, particularly in the most productive western basin. After identifying suitable horizontal and vertical resolutions that allowed for accurate depiction of in-lake nutrient concentrations and plankton biomass, we explored how variation in nutrient (phosphorus, nitrogen) loading and dreissenid mussel density could influence plankton dynamics. Our scenario-testing showed that western Lake Erie's phytoplankton community appeared more limited by phosphorus than nitrogen on both seasonal and interannual scales with light limitation occurring in the nearshore and Maumee River plume areas. Dreissenid mussel impacts varied temporally, with phytoplankton communities being highly influenced by dreissenid nutrient excretion at times (under low nutrient availability) and dreissenid grazing at other times (under bloom conditions). It was concluded that the effect of zooplankton predation on phytoplankton was stronger than that of dreissenid mussels, and that multiple algal groups could promote the efficiency of nutrient assimilation and the overall plankton production. Additionally, river inputs and wind-driven water circulation were important by causing heterogeneity in habitat conditions through nutrient advection and vertical mixing, and wind-induced surface waves could result in non-negligible down-wind redistribution of plankton biomass, which increased with wind/wave magnitude.

AB  - Conveying natural gas through a pipeline is widely accompanied by accidents in industries. It is important to perform hazard analysis by estimating the amount of released gas at the first step immediately after the happening. The present study proposes a new approach to evaluate the gas release rate and released mass by introducing non-dimensional equations for simulating quasi-one-dimensional transient compressible flow in a ruptured gas pipeline. These equations are derived from Euler equations. The hyperbolic governing equations are solved numerically by the explicit MacCormack's method. The influence of different dimensionless physical parameters on release rate are then investigated; among which relative pressure, relative hole diameter and friction term are the most important parameters. Results show that the release rate has the similar behavior for a wide range of operating pressures from 60 psig (0.4 MPa for distribution pipeline) to 1000 psig (6.9 MPa for transmission pipeline). Since choking condition happens in rupture area, release rate is not a function of pipeline pressure. Therefore, relative hole diameter and friction term are the only effective parameters in this case. By introducing an indicator and its criterion for long pipelines it could be seen that not only is this indicator dependent on geometry (i.e. ratio of length to diameter of pipe), but it also belongs to flow regime (i.e. friction coefficient). Finally, general relations for natural gas release rate in any physical condition are proposed by exploring effective dimensionless parameters on released mass. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A variety of secondary mineralogies has been detected on Mars from both orbiters and landers, indicating widespread aqueous alteration of the crust. Many of these locales exhibit sulfates, which in some cases imply acidic fluids. At present, there are few constraints on the paleoenvironmental conditions that existed during formation of the widespread and diverse classes of secondary minerals on Mars. We investigated hydrothermal systems at three active acidic volcanic systems in Nicaragua, including Cerro Negro, Momotombo, and Telica. The recently erupted materials are similar in composition to the Martian crust and are undergoing extensive acid-sulfate alteration predominately in gas-dominated settings (fumaroles). We characterized the secondary mineralogy and local variables, including temperature, pH, rock and gas composition, and fluid-rock ratio. We find that these environmental parameters exhibit strong controls on the alteration mineralogy. The environments studied include pH that ranged from -1 to 6, temperatures from ambient to hundreds of degrees Celsius, and fumaroles to hot springs. The hottest and most acidic systems contained sulfur, silica, and minor gypsum, while moderately acidic and cooler fumaroles included abundant silica, gypsum and other hydrated sulfates, and phyllosilicates. A setting with a higher fluid-rock ratio but similar temperature and acidity was dominated by phyllosilicates and, to a lesser degree, sulfates. The characterization of aqueous alteration of basalts under a variety of environmental conditions provides a conceptual framework for interpretation of similar relic environments on Mars. Finally, while identification of phyllosilicates on Mars is generally thought to require neutral to alkaline fluids, we documented significant formation of these minerals in the acidic volcanic systems.

AB  - Risk has been defined, for management purposes, as the potential economic, social and environmental consequences of hazardous events that may occur in a specified period of time. In the past, the concept of risk has been defined in many cases in a fragmentary way, according to each scientific discipline involved in its appraisal. A framework and a multidisciplinary risk evaluation model is proposed in this article that take into account not only the expected physical damage, the number and type of casualties or the economic losses, but also the conditions related to social fragility and lack of resilience which favor second order effects (or indirect effects) when an earthquake strikes an urban centre. Thus, the mentioned evaluation is holistic, that is, based on an integrated and comprehensive approach, made by using indicators and oriented towards guiding decision-making. The conceptual framework and the model proposed are also valid for their application to multihazard risk evaluation, although this article has been focused on the evaluation of the seismic risk. The first step in obtaining the Urban Seismic Risk index (USRi) consists of calculating a Physical Risk index for each unit of analysis starting from existing physical risk scenarios. An impact factor, associated with a set of socio-economic and lack of resilience conditions of the community, is applied in a second step to the physical risk index in order to obtain the USRi. It has been demonstrated that the proponed holistic evaluation model of the seismic risk is robust, providing stable and reliable values of the USRi. Finally, numerical simulation results of the seismic risk obtained with the proposed model are given in the article for the cities of Bogota (Colombia), Barcelona (Spain) and Manila, (The Phillipines).

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia is a neurodegenerative disease caused by reduced expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. The main phenotypic features of frataxin-deficient human and yeast cells include iron accumulation in mitochondria, iron-sulphur cluster defects and high sensitivity to oxidative stress. Glutathione is a major protective agent against oxidative damage and glutathione-related systems participate in maintaining the cellular thiol/disulfide status and the reduced environment of the cell. Here, we present the first detailed biochemical study of the glutathione-dependent redox status of wild-type and frataxin-deficient cells in a yeast model of the disease. There were five times less total glutathione (GSH+GSSG) in frataxin-deficient cells, imbalanced GSH/GSSG pools and higher glutathione peroxidase activity. The pentose phosphate pathway was stimulated in frataxin-deficient cells, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was three times higher than in wild-type cells and this was coupled to a defect in the NADPH/NADP(+) pool. Moreover, analysis of gene expression confirms the adaptative response of mutant cells to stress conditions and we bring evidence for a strong relation between the glutathione-dependent redox status of the cells and iron homeostasis. Dynamic studies show that intracellular glutathione levels reflect an adaptation of cells to iron stress conditions, and allow to distinguish constitutive stress observed in frataxin-deficient cells from the acute response of wild-type cells. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence for an impairment of glutathione homeostasis in a yeast model of Friedreich's ataxia and identify glutathione as a valuable indicator of the redox status of frataxin-deficient cells.

AB  - The spatial and temporal variations in the composition of Pseudo-nitzschia during bloom events from August 2005 to February 2006 were characterised in two bays of the NW Mediterranean ea (Alfacs and Fangar Bay) by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The study provides detailed records of the Pseudo-nitzschia community at the species level and describes its relationship with both the surrounding environmental conditions and biotic factors Such as the accompanying phytoplankton community. The size distributions of several species of Pseudo-nitzschia were monitored during the bloom events. These measurements may serve as indicators of the physiological status of the cells. The species observed in the two bays were Pseudo-nitzschia calliantha, P. delicatissima, P. fraudulenta, P. multistriata, and P. pungens. In Alfacs Bay, a mixed species bloom of P. calliantha and P. delicotissima began in late August 2005 and lasted I I weeks. In Fangar Bay, the Pseudo-nitzschia bloom was limited to the period from early August to late September 2005 and comprised P. calliantha and P. delicatissima. Commonly, the proliferation of Pseudo-nitzschia was mono-specific or was accompanied by other diatoms. Two objectively defined groups were identified by the statistical analysis in Alfacs bay; the first was made up only of winter samples and the second of summer and autumn samples. The first group was defined by a high concentration of NO3- and low concentrations of NH4+ conditions associated with a high abundance of P. delicatissima and a low abundance of P. calliantha. The second group expressed the opposite characteristics. A succession of different blooming species of Pseudo-nitzschia lasting months in Alfacs Bay is described.

AB  - The Rybinsk Reservoir (Russia) is the largest artificial waterbody in Europe (4550 kin 2) and provides drinking water for population of the cities located along the coast line. industrialization in Cherepovets at the northeastern portion of the reservoir, including one of the largest metallurgical facilities in Europe, has resulted in chemical contamination of the reservoir. The extent of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) contamination in bream liver, a common fish species, taken from six locations in the Rybinsk Reservoir and Volga River, and biochemical and morphometric biomarkers of fish health were investigated. Liver PCB concentrations ranged from non-detected to 3.4 mu g/g wet wt of liver, with the greatest concentrations found in fish taken near the industrialized area in Sheksna Reach of Rybinsk Reservoir. The source of the bream contamination is the PCB pollution of bottom organisms and sediments conditioned with industrialization facilities of Cherepovets. The patterns of the PCB congeners in the livers of bream taken near Cherepovets were similar at all of the stations that were sampled around the reservoir and Volga River. Among the common fish health biomarkers used only liver total ChE activity and liver-somatic index in bream near Cherepovets can reflect environmental pollution. Other morphometric (FCF, Clark's condition factors, and spleen-somatic index) and biochemical (protein content and acetylcholinesterase activity in the brain) biomarkers related with fish health varied among locations, but were not correlated to the concentrations of PCBs in the bream livers.

AB  - The present study was conducted with the aim of improving faecal coliform (FC) and faecal streptococcus (FS) removal efficiencies in tertiary maturation stages of a sewage treatment plant in Southern England, where climatic conditions are sub-optimal. The research used intensive field assessments (bacteriological, general quality and hydraulic) to identify the parameters that affect the bacteriological quality of the effluent from three parallel maturation ponds (North, Central and South) of similar geometry and dimensions. An engineering intervention was carried out to convert the South pond to three channels to increase the L/W ratio from 9:1 to 79:1. Hydraulic tracer studies in the South pond with Rhodamine WT showed that the dispersion number 'd' was reduced from 0.37 (dispersed flow) to 0.074 by this intervention under similar flow conditions (4.5 l/s). Hydraulic retention time was thus increased by 5 h, delay in jet flow short-circuiting was increased from 2.5 to 17.5 h thus increasing the exposure times for all elements. As a result of the intervention FC removal increased substantially. Maximum channel-lagoon efficiency of 99.84% was obtained at 4.5 l/s and 19 degrees C, when exposure to sunlight was 17 h in summer. It is concluded that the channel configuration produces a higher hydraulic efficiency than conventional maturation ponds. It is therefore recommended as a viable engineering solution which permits a low-cost upgrading of plant performance, requiring no additional land, and with minimal maintenance costs.

AB  - Radiolarians were studied in 11 box-cores (142 samples in total, obtained at 3cm intervals) retrieved in the western (160-degrees-E), central (135-degrees-W) and eastern (90-degrees-W) equatorial Pacific. The western and central cores span the last ca. 40,000 years, while the eastern core is estimated to reach approx. 12,000-17,000 years. Time-averaged data show very sharp assemblage composition differences between the three locales. Species dominant at the westernmost sites are indicative of warm, oligotrophic conditions; thanatocoenoses from 135-degrees-W suggest strong input of California Current radiolarians; while the easternmost core hosts assemblages which point to a significant influence of the Peru Current. Downcore changes in the proportions of these three characteristic groups of species are inconclusive in the westernmost cores. In the central area the steady upcore increase in shells presumably advected from the northeastern Pacific, and the concomitant decrease of warmer-water radiolarians, indicate a growing influence of advection from the California Current. In the easternmost core colder-water indicators decrease from bottom to top, while those indicative of warmer waters increase, suggesting a gradual waning of advection from the Peru Current. It is concluded that, in the central and eastern parts of the equatorial Pacific belt, radiolarian distributional patterns in the sediments and their shifts during the last millennia respond chiefly to environmental conditions at depths in excess of 50m (rather than to sea surface temperature), and to subsurface and deep lateral advection of shells from eastern boundary current areas.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to assess the development potential of cities and municipalities in Walbrzych County, approached from the perspective of social, economic and environmental potential. Comparisons were performed for the periods 2002-2004 and 2016-2018. The following problem questions were formulated in the study: Which strategic goals can currently act as incentives for taking action in the analysed post-industrial areas, and for which ones should development be particularly strengthened? What development direction should be taken by individual municipalities in Walbrzych County? The research covering the development potential of the municipalities was conducted using the multidimensional analysis method, and the similarities in municipal potential were analysed taking into account a comparison of distances between individual diagnostic variables. Among the analysed municipalities, in terms of social, economic and environmental potential, Szczawno-Zdroj and Czarny Bor achieved the best results, and Boguszow Gorce ranked the worst. In some municipalities, a noticeable increase in social potential (Jedlina-Zdroj, Mieroszow, Walim) or economic potential (Jedlina-Zdroj) was observed, and a significant decline in economic potential in Stare Bogaczowice was seen. As a result of the research, the following was established: the policies of municipal authorities have to focus on improving the living conditions of residents; the crucial factors are opening new jobs, providing appropriate living conditions and services and offering diverse sports and tourism options. Efforts should be made to take advantage of the inherent potential in the area, also by highlighting the preserved post-industrial buildings and constructions.

AB  - Understanding of animal responses to dynamic resource landscapes is based largely on research on temperate species with small body sizes and fast life histories. We studied a large, tropical mammal with an extremely slow life history, the Western Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii), across a heterogeneous natural landscape encompassing seven distinct forest types. Our goals were to characterize fluctuations in abundance, test hypotheses regarding the relationship between dispersion dynamics and resource availability, and evaluate how movement patterns are influenced by abiotic conditions. We surveyed abundance in Gunung Palung National Park, West Kalimantan, Indonesia, for 99 consecutive months and simultaneously recorded weather data and assessed fruit availability. We developed a Bayesian hierarchical distance sampling model to estimate population dispersion and assess the roles of fruit availability, rainfall, and temperature in driving movement patterns across this heterogeneous landscape. Orangutan abundance varied dramatically over space and time. Each forest type was important in sustaining more than 40% of the total orangutans on site during at least one month, as animals moved to track asynchronies in fruiting phenology. We conclude that landscape-level movements buffer orangutans against fruit scarcity, peat swamps are crucial fallback habitats, and orangutans' use of high elevation forests is strongly dependent on abiotic conditions. Our results show that orangutans can periodically occupy putative-sink habitats and be virtually absent for extended periods from habitats that are vitally important in sustaining their population, highlighting the need for long-term studies and potential risks in interpreting occurrence or abundance measures as indicators of habitat importance.

AB  - A vegetation survey of three model sites has been conducted on the Emdy limestone plateau in the Mangyshlak middle desert subzone on the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea (Western Kazakhstan). The main goal was to find indicator species in vegetation composition which reflect ancient anthropogenic influence from about 1500 years ago. The model sites are situated in comparable ecological conditions and differ only by the type and time of anthropogenic influence. One is located in the area of an ancient settlement from the 3rd to 5th centuries, the second is in an area that may have been used for agriculture, and the third is a control without hardly any anthropogenic influence. It is found that four main synusia can be determined in the plant community structure. The most diverse synusia of the desert ephemeras contains 61% of the plant species pool and may be considered an indicator of former anthropogenic activity. There were no specific plants connected with past agriculture on the second site. Considering this fact, together with general ecological conditions of the site, it was concluded that there had been no agriculture on this site. It is shown that different ephemeral species react to microhabitat characteristics such as humidity, insolation, salinization, and soil bioturbations. All ephemeral species can be divided into true and induced ephemera. The latter group consists of widespread ruderal annual mesophytes (Buglossoides arvensis and Descurainia sophia). These species appear in places of long and intense anthropogenic pressure and are able to persist in plant communities at least up to 1500 years after the end of anthropogenic pressure.

AB  - Applying phytotechnologies with energy crops on lands contaminated with trace elements provides cellulosic biomass and improves soil health. The process can be reflected in changes in the soil nematode community structure. This study assessed the nematode community composition of soil with Miscanthus grown with different agronomic practices. The research was conducted at Fort Riley, Kansas, USA, in soil with aged contamination by Pb at 1000 to 1500 mg/kg. The experimental design was a randomized complete block composed of four replications of five treatments: Control-undisturbed mixed plant cover and four conditions of Miscanthus growth, which consisted of No-till, Till (immediately before planting), Till + P, and Till + biosolids. Analysis of abundance, diversity, and community functional status indicators showed differential sensitivity of nematode taxa to agronomic treatments. Significant transformations in the nematode trophic group structure occurred under Miscanthus cultivation compared with the undisturbed mixed plant cover. Shannon and Pielou index response to agronomic treatments illustrated decreasing nematode community diversity with all Miscanthus agronomic conditions. However, agronomic practices led to increasing nematode community maturity, but those effects varied between spring and fall seasons. Increasing herbivores and omnivore-predators were the primary drivers of the observed changes in the nematode community due to planting Miscanthus. The nematode ecological structure indicators suggested that growth in Pb-contaminated land using different agronomical practices likely affects essential soil processes. More study is needed to define the effects of pre-plant tillage and amendments to soil nematode communities and Miscanthus yield over multiple growing seasons of this perennial crop.

AB  - Context Biotic homogenization (BH), the process by which beta-diversity erodes, is suspected to be severe among plant communities due to widespread anthropogenic disturbances. However, few studies have directly linked anthropogenic disturbance with patterns of BH. The US National Wetlands Condition Assessment (NWCA) provides an opportunity to investigate patterns of beta-diversity related to anthropogenic disturbances. Objectives Our objectives were to compare beta-diversity between highly, intermediately and less-disturbed herbaceous emergent wetlands across the temperate region of the conterminous US, and to identify species with greatest influence on beta-diversity patterns within disturbance categories. Methods Using species occurrence and abundance data, average distances to group centroids in ordination space were used to assess wetland beta-diversity across a disturbance gradient. Species contributions to beta-diversity were calculated per disturbance category. Results Compared to the least and intermediately disturbed wetlands, highly disturbed wetlands had significantly lower beta-diversity based on species abundances across the study area. When using only species occurrences, highly disturbed wetlands had significantly lower beta-diversity than intermediately disturbed wetlands. No significant differences were found amongst disturbance categories at the within-site scale. The invasive grass Phalaris arundinacea had the greatest influence on beta-diversity, especially in the most disturbed wetlands. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that anthropogenic disturbances have homogenized regional botanical diversity. This homogenization is a function of disturbance intensity, which, after a threshold is crossed creates environmental conditions that lead to the local dominance of a single, widespread invader. This process is repeated across the region, scaling up to homogenize the flora of the entire region.

AB  - This study investigated, for the first time, the occurrence and fate of 29 multiple-class pharmaceuticals (PhACs) in two source separated sanitation systems based on: (i) batch experiments for the anaerobic digestion (AD) of fecal sludge under mesophilic (37 `C) and thermophilic (52 "C) conditions, and (ii) a full-scale blackwater treatment plant using wet composting and sanitation with urea addition. Results revealed high concentrations of PhACs in raw fecal sludge and blackwater samples, with concentrations up to hundreds of pg L-1 and fig kg-1 dry weight (dw) in liquid and solid fractions, respectively. For mesophilic and thermophilic treatments in the batch experiments, average PhACs removal rates of 31% and 45%, respectively, were observed. The average removal efficiency was slightly better for the full-scale blackwater treatment, with 49% average removal, and few compounds, such as atenolol, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide, showed almost complete degradation. In the AD treatments, no significant differences were observed between mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. For the full-scale blackwater treatment, the aerobic wet composting step proved to be the most efficient in PhACs reduction, while urea addition had an almost negligible effect for most PhACs, except for citalopram, venlafaxine, oxazepam, valsartan and atorvastatin, for which minor reductions (on average 25%) were observed. Even though both treatment systems reduced initial PhACs loads considerably, significant PhAC concentrations remained in the treated effluents, indicating that fecal sludge and blackwater fertilizations could be a relevant vector for dissemination of PhACs into agricultural fields and thus the environment.

AB  - In Florida, resource use patterns by Armases cinereum (Armases), a highly abundant crab in coastal habitats, may serve as important indicators of habitat condition. Here we investigated feeding patterns of Armases in coastal palm scrub forest to intertidal mangrove forest transition zones (transitions) as well as the relationship between habitat disturbance and Armases' trophic position across three pairs of geographically separated populations in Tampa FL, USA. Each pair of sites represented an unmodified "natural" location as well as a "disturbed" location lacking upland terrestrial palm scrub forested habitat. Laboratory experiments established a baseline understanding of feeding preference of Armases offered strictly mangrove material as well as sources abundant at the transition. In-situ feeding behavior was examined using MixSIAR mixing models with delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotope tracers. Armases showed a strong preference for consuming partially-decomposed mangrove material from Avicennia germinans and an equally strong preference for Iva frutescens. Armases also displayed predatory behavior under laboratory conditions, confirming omnivory in the presence of mangrove material. Stable isotopes revealed a pattern of elevated trophic position of Armases in disturbed habitats over paired natural locations. Diet reconstruction provided coarse resolution of in-situ feeding and results show high spatial variation: in natural habitats, Armases appears to rely heavily upon upland plant material compared to disturbed habitats where it may consume more animal prey. Combined, these findings support that Armases trophic position and diet may indicate habitat quality in mangrove transitions in the southeastern United States.

AB  - Energy efficiency in biomass production is a major challenge for a future transition to sustainable food and energy provision. This study uses methodologically consistent data on agroecosystem energy flows and different metrics of energetic efficiency from seven regional case studies in North America (USA and Canada) and Europe (Spain and Austria) to investigate energy transitions in Western agroecosystems from the late nineteenth to the late twentieth centuries. We quantify indicators such as external final energy return on investment (EFEROI, i.e., final produce per unit of external energy input), internal final EROI (IFEROI, final produce per unit of biomass reused locally), and final EROI (FEROI, final produce per unit of total inputs consumed). The transition is characterized by increasing final produce accompanied by increasing external energy inputs and stable local biomass reused. External inputs did not replace internal biomass reinvestments, but added to them. The results were declining EFEROI, stable or increasing IFEROI, and diverging trends in FEROI. The factors shaping agroecosystem energy profiles changed in the course of the transition: Under advanced organic and frontier agriculture of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, population density and biogeographic conditions explained both agroecosystem productivity and energy inputs. In industrialized agroecosystems, biogeographic conditions and specific socio-economic factors influenced trends towards increased agroecosystem specialization. The share of livestock products in a region's final produce was the most important factor determining energy returns on investment.

AB  - Information on ecosystem sensitivity to global change can help guide management decisions. Here, we characterize the sensitivity of the Puget Sound ecosystem to ocean acidification by estimating, at a number of taxonomic levels, the direct sensitivity of its species. We compare sensitivity estimates based on species mineralogy and on published literature from laboratory experiments and field studies. We generated information on the former by building a database of species in Puget Sound with mineralogy estimates for all CaCO3-forming species. For the latter, we relied on a recently developed database and meta-analysis on temperate species responses to increased CO2. In general, species sensitivity estimates based on the published literature suggest that calcifying species are more sensitive to increased CO2 than non-calcifying species. However, this generalization is incomplete, as non-calcifying species also show direct sensitivity to high CO2 conditions. We did not find a strong link between mineral solubility and the sensitivity of species survival to changes in carbonate chemistry, suggesting that, at coarse scales, mineralogy plays a lesser role to other physiological sensitivities. Summarizing species sensitivity at the family level resulted in higher sensitivity scalar scores than at the class level, suggesting that grouping results at the class level may overestimate species sensitivity. This result raises caution about the use of broad generalizations on species response to ocean acidification, particularly when developing summary information for specific locations. While we have much to learn about species response to ocean acidification and how to generalize ecosystem response, this study on Puget Sound suggests that detailed information on species performance under elevated carbon dioxide conditions, summarized at the lowest taxonomic level possible, is more valuable than information on species mineralogy.

AB  - Bisphenol A is a compound used to produce plastics. Today, it is identified in the aquatic environment. As part of the work there are performed studies to determine the effect of the aquatic environment conditions on the decomposition of bisphenol A. As the subject of research there were used different aqueous solutions prepared on the basis of deionized or surface water with addition of a bisphenol A standard at concentration of 1 mg/dm(3). To the selected solutions it was added the mineral medium or surface water, which was the source of both organic materials and inorganic compounds and microorganisms. Optionally, the selected solutions had been kept in the dark or in the light of sun, and they had been aerated. Solutions after biodegradation were also subjected of the toxicological evaluation with application of the enzymatic test using bioluminescent bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri, survival test using shellfish Daphnia magna and the growth test of aquatic plant Lemna minor. It was determined that the decomposition of bisphenol A in an aquatic environment is low and it is mainly under the influence of sunlight, with the participation of microorganisms. The presence of mineral salts in aquatic environment is also important. on the other hand, the toxicological assessment of solutions, which was made during testing biodegradation, showed that they have a different toxicity. Toxicity class of the solution also depended on the type of applied indicator, which proves their differences in sensitivity to bisphenol A. High toxicity was noted in the case of bioluminescent bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri after 14 days of the biodegradation study.

AB  - While previous boreal peatland wildfire research has generally reported average organic soil burn depths ranging from 0.05 to 0.20m, here, we report on deep burning in a peatland in the Utikuma Complex forest fire (SWF-060, similar to 90000ha, May 2011) in the sub-humid climate of Alberta's Boreal Plains. Deep burning was prevalent at peatland margins, where average burn depths of 0.42 +/- 0.02m were fivefold greater than in the middle of the peatland. We examined adjacent unburned sections of the peatland to characterize the hydrological and hydrophysical conditions necessary to account for the observed burn depths. Our findings suggest that the peatland margin at this site represented a smouldering hotspot due to the effect of dynamic hydrological conditions on margin peat bulk density and moisture. Specifically, the coupling of dense peat (bulk density >100kgm(-3)) and low peat moisture (m <250%) at the peatland margin allowed for severe smouldering to propagate deep into the peat profile. We estimated that carbon release from this margin hotspot' ranged from 10 to 85kgCm(-2) (mean=27kgCm(-2)), accounting for similar to 80% of the total soil carbon loss from the peatland during the wildfire. As such, we suggest that current estimations of peatland carbon loss from wildfires that exclude (and/or miss) these hotspots' are likely underestimating total carbon emissions from peatland wildfires. We conclude that assessments of natural and managed peatland vulnerability to wildfire should focus on identifying dense peat on the landscape that is vulnerable to drying.

AB  - A 31 year (1980-2010) sequence of historical analyses of the California Current System (CCS) is used to describe the central CCS (35-43N) coastal upwelling response to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability. The analysis period captures 10 El Nino and 10 La Nina events, including the extreme El Ninos of 1982-1983 and 1997-1998. Data-assimilative model runs and backward trajectory calculations of passive tracers are used to elucidate physical conditions and source water characteristics during the upwelling season of each year. In general, El Nino events produce anomalously weak upwelling and source waters that are unusually shallow, warm, and fresh, while La Nina conditions produce the opposite. Maximum vertical transport anomalies in the CCS occur approximate to 1 month after El Nino peaks in midwinter, and before the onset of the upwelling season. Source density anomalies peak later than transport anomalies and persist more strongly through the spring and summer, causing the former to impact the upwelling season more directly. As nitrate concentration covaries with density in the central CCS, El Nino may exert more influence over the nitrate concentration of upwelled waters than it does over vertical transport, although both factors are expected to reduce nitrate supply during El Nino events. Interannual comparison of individual diagnostics highlights their relative impacts during different ENSO events, as well as years deviating from the canonical response to ENSO variability. The net impact of ENSO on upwelling is explored through an Upwelling Efficacy Index, which may be a useful indicator of bottom-up control on primary productivity.

AB  - SeaWiFS surface chlorophyll estimates and Levitus nitrate estimates in the Southern Ocean south of Australia (140 E) show that this region is characterised by a high-nitrate low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regime typical of Southern Ocean waters. The HNLC conditions become more prominent moving south from the Sub-Antarctic Zone, with surface chlorophyll generally decreasing and nitrate increasing with latitude. Parameter optimisation experiments were performed using simulated annealing to fit a zero-dimensional nitrogen-based four-component ecosystem model to SeaWiFS surface chlorophyll data in the Sub-Antarctic Zone (SAZ), Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) and Antarctic Zone (AZ). We hypothesise that bioavailability of iron limits phytoplankton growth in this region. A physiological indicator of iron availability was investigated by optimising three of the model parameters defining maximum photosynthetic growth and maximum photosynthetic efficiency of phytoplankton. The effect of zooplankton grazing and light, mixed layer depth and temperature forcing data on the optimisation results was investigated in further optimisation experiments. An error analysis of the optimised parameter estimates was performed by analysing the Hessian matrix of the cost function.
   The parameter optimisations indicate that phytoplankton growth rates in the Polar Frontal Zone and Antarctic Zone are limited by some process not explicitly included in this model, with iron availability being the most likely candidate. Based on these optimisations we support the theory that micronutrient availability is the primary cause of the HNLC conditions in the Australian sector of the Southern Ocean. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Having evolved a parasitic relation to their host plants, aphids may serve as indicators of plant responses to environmental changes. The present rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations is expected to alter plant leaf chemistry and may thus alter host plant aphid relations. We involved a climate chamber system and used bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi L.) and green peach aphid (Myzus persicae S.) and their respective host plants, spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. "Triso") and oilseed rape (Brassica napus cv. "Campino"), to elucidate the effects of atmospheric CO2 enrichment on such bitrophic systems. Spring wheat grown at elevated CO2 (600 ppm) generally had greater above ground biomass than plants grown at ambient CO2 (400 ppm). Bird cherry-oat aphid infestation resulted in reduced spring wheat above ground biomass compared to the non-infested control. Relative crop growth rate (RGR) was increased by elevated CO2. In our study, the relative developmental stage (rDS) and intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) of the aphids was only slightly and non-significantly increased under elevated atmospheric CO2 conditions. The response of aphid weight and RGR to elevated CO2 differed, increasing by 24% and 18.2% for bird cherry-oat aphid and decreasing by 12% and 12.5% for green peach aphid, respectively. Aphids reared on spring wheat at elevated CO2 had a shorter lifespan, whereas the opposite effect was found for aphids reared on oilseed rape. The average number of nymphs of the two pest species showed both an increase under elevated CO2. No consistent picture emerges from these findings, and further investigation on host - aphid relations under changing atmospheric conditions such as CO2 enrichment appear necessary.

AB  - Assessing moisture contents of lichens and mosses using ground-based high-spectral resolution spectrometers offers immense opportunities for a comprehensive monitoring of peatland moisture status by satellite/airborne imagery. This study investigates the impact of various moisture conditions of the lichens Cladina stellaris and Cladina rangiferina, and the mosses Dicranum elongatum and Tomenthypnum nitens on the spectral signatures obtained. Reflectance and moisture content measurements of these species were made in a laboratory setting, while maintaining the natural moisture conditions of the samples; once the moisture and spectral measurements were complete, the samples were returned to the field and placed in their natural setting, continuously receiving moisture from precipitation and groundwater and losing water through evaporation and drainage. Previously, we correlated the present spectral indices with the moisture contents of the above species, whereas the current study developed new species-specific indices to improve the detection of the plants' moisture contents. The relationship between the plants' moisture content and the water table position was examined as well. It was found that the lichens are not responsive to variations in the water table position, whereas the mosses, specifically D. elongatum, are quite sensitive to changes in the water table position. Thus, the use of the mosses spectral indices may contribute to an indirect evaluation of the water table position. Overall, the results suggest that the unique spectral signatures of the above species can be detected by satellite and airborne imagery, whereas the mosses, can be used as indicators of peatlands moisture status.

AB  - In this study, a water resource management model that facilitates indicator-based decisions, with respect to environmental, social and economic dimensions in a multiple criteria perspective, is developed for the Gediz River Basin in Turkey. The basic input of the proposed model is the quantity of surface water that is mainly allocated to irrigation purposes. The model has been applied under 3 different hydro-meteorological scenarios that reflect baseline as well as better and worse conditions of water supply and demand, not only to reach a comprehensive assessment of the water budget in the Gediz Basin, but also to evaluate the impacts of proposed management alternatives under different conditions. The Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) software is used as a simulation and evaluation tool to assess the performance of possible management alternatives; performance is measured by 9 indicators representing economic, social and environmental sustainability. The study has delineated the best management alternative on the basis of 3 different multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods, including simple additive weighting (SAW), compromise programming (CP) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). Each method is also applied with 7 different sets of criteria weights that represent objective judgements as well as subjective preferences of decision makers. The results of the study indicate that the decision on the best alternative is basically independent of the MCDM method used, but slightly sensitive to the weights assigned to the criteria as well as the data used in the analyses.

AB  - Mecoprop is an acid herbicide that is widely used for agricultural, horticultural and domestic purposes. It is considered one of the key indicators of pollution from municipal solid waste landfill, as it is frequently identified in landfill leachate. Mecoprop is the most frequently occurring herbicide detected in UK groundwater and the second most common herbicide in UK surface waters. Mecoprop is water-soluble and subject to relatively little retardation by sorption processes, hence it is subject to relatively conservative transport in soils and aquifers. Once in the subsurface it can be persistent. Information and data to underpin the assessment of mecoprop fate and attenuation in the subsurface are therefore of particular importance. This paper reviews the processes that contribute to the attenuation of mecoprop in the subsurface, particularly in groundwater. Biodegradation of mecoprop is the only significant destructive attenuation mechanism operating under subsurface conditions. Biodegradation in topsoil has been relatively widely studied and is commonly observed, but the scientific literature on mecoprop biodegradation in the deeper subsurface is limited and indicates great variability as to the degree and rate at which it takes place, particularly in aerobic aquifers. The apparent recalcitrance under anaerobic conditions means that where it has been disposed of to landfill it is frequently among the most persistent organic compounds in chemically reducing leachate plumes. Mecoprop sorption to sediment surfaces is related to the organic and inorganic geochemistry of mecoprop and the sediment. It is suggested that the generally applied model that uses K-OC for predicting sorption of organic solutes may not be appropriate for use with mecoprop.

AB  - The objective of the experiments was to determine the values of the agronomical melon (Cucumis melo L.) leaf indices, represented by both area (FLA) and dry weight (FLW) of the fifth leaf from the apex associated with the nitrogen rate for the maximum melon fruit yield (MFY), at two samples dates and two environmental conditions. Two experiments, in unheated greenhouse and field conditions, were carried out with similar procedures. Each experiment consisted of four randomized blocks containing five treatments or five nitrogen rates (0, 75, 150, 300, and 450 kg ha(-1) of N), applied as urea. Part of the fertilizer was placed in furrows (30%), before seedling transplantation, and the remaining 70% were trickle-applied through part of the plant cycle. Initially, 14 days after transplantation, plant chlorosis intensity was evaluated by scores from 0 (no chlorosis) to 5 (leaves completely chlorotics). At 25 and 53 days after transplantation, at first and second fruit setting, FLA and FLW were determined. At both experiments, chlorosis intensity decreased, FLA and FLW increased with increasing N rates. Chlorosis intensity values associated with MFY were 0.22 and 1.11 at greenhouse and field, respectively. In the greenhouse, at first and second sampling dates, FLA values associated with MFY were 107 and 72 cm(2) and FLW values were 0.36 and 0.26 g, respectively. In the field, the corresponding values were 89 and 69 cm(2) and 0.39 and 0.30 g, respectively. These are proposed melon plant index values indicators of the added N fertilizer rate adequacy.

AB  - Capelin area major component of cod diet in many ecosystems of the North Atlantic. In the Bering Sea, however, the percentage of capelin found in Pacific cod stomachs is negligible. We hypothesize that the landscape (or 'seascape') features of hydrography and bathymetry of the Bering Sea impose a constraint on the distribution of cod and capelin that contributes to their spatial segregation and ultimately, to their uniquely weak trophic link. We analyzed a long-term data collection (1972 to 2001) on Pacific cod and capelin catches and feeding interactions, and developed a new metric to quantify the spatially explicit overlap between a predator and a prey. Our analysis indicates that cod and capelin distributions respond to the thermal conditions of the Bering Sea. Typically, a frigid water mass is present on the middle portion of the shelf, and cod distribution is confined to the southern side of the cold pool, while capelin is confined to the north. However, in warm years the middle shelf is penetrated by thermal gateways (between 1 and 6 degrees C), allowing cod to invade the capelin habitat. In this situation, when cod and capelin overlap, cod feed heavily on capelin. The annual index of cod and capelin overlap is correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index, a climate indicator of the North Pacific. The width of the thermal gateways in the middle shelf is also correlated with the PDO. These results point to a direct causal link, from climate and thermal conditions of the Bering Sea shelf, to cod and capelin distribution, and ultimately to their overlap and trophic interactions.

AB  - Question: Does the understorey vegetation of Norwegian boreal forests change in relation to broad-scale, long-term changes?
   Location: Norway.
   Methods: Permanently marked 1-m(2) vegetation plots from 17 monitoring reference areas in forests dominated by Picea abies (11 areas, 620 plots) and Betula spp. (six areas, 300 plots) were analysed twice, at the start in 1988-1997 and 5 yr later (1993-2002). Species subplot frequency data were analysed separately for each area by univariate and multivariate statistical methods; 5-yr changes in single species abundances, species number per plot and species composition were tested.
   Results: Two distinct patterns of change were found: 1. Abundance of several vascular plant species decreased in SE Norwegian Picea forests. most noticeably of species with a preference for richer soils, such as Oxalis acetosella. 2. Abundance of many bryophyte species as well as bryophyte species number per plot increased in forests of both types over most of Norway.
   Conclusions: The pattern of vascular plant changes is probably a time-delayed response of long-lived, mainly clonal, populations to acidified soils resulting from deposition of long-distance airborne pollutants. The pattern bryophyte changes. with reference to the close link between climatic conditions for growth and abundance changes for Hylocomium splendens established in previous demographic studies, is related to climatic conditions favourable for bryophyte growth. We conclude that many forest understorey plants are sensitive indicators of environmental change, and that the concept used for intensive monitoring of Norwegian forests enables early detection of changes in vegetation brought about by broad-scale, regional, impact factors.

AB  - Cross-institutional studies that combine non-invasive physiological measures of stress responses and the assessment of individual differences in behaviour and temperament have great potential as tools for assessing the well-being of zoo animals and for identifying key environmental stimuli relevant to well-being. In addition, such studies allow comparison of animals under a wide variety of conditions and enable researchers to obtain sufficiently large samples sizes for statistical data analyses. Faecal corticoid measurements, a method recently developed to monitor adrenal activity in wildlife and domestic species, can be obtained non-invasively as part of the normal husbandry routine. While basic techniques still need improvement, and interpretation of the acquired measures can be challenging, assessment of faecal corticoid concentrations can provide a useful indicator of stress responses under a variety of captive conditions. Here we report on three studies that illustrate this approach and the results that can be obtained. An on-going study reveals significant differences in the pattern of variability of faecal corticoid concentrations between polar bears that are reported by keepers to perform stereotypic behaviour and those that do not. In another study, faecal corticoid measures indicated that stress responses to certain extraneous noises might interfere with the breeding of Hawaiian honeycreepers in captivity. In a study of clouded leopards, higher faecal corticoid concentrations were measured when cats were kept on public display or near potential predators compared to individuals maintained off exhibit or in the absence of visible predators. The findings of an on-going experimental study suggest a causal relationship between the provision of additional hiding spaces and a decline in faecal corticoid concentrations in clouded leopards.

AB  - Pesticides can volatilize into the atmosphere, which affects the air quality. The ability to predict pesticide volatilization is an essential tool for human risk and environmental assessment. Even though there are several mathematical models to assess and predict the fate of pesticides in different compartments of the environment, there is no reliable model to predict volatilization. The objectives of this study were to evaluate pesticide volatilization under agricultural conditions using malathion [O,O-dimethyl-S-(1,2-dicarbethoxyethyl)-dithiophosphate], ethoprophos (O-ethyl S,S-dipropylphosphorodithioate), and procymidone [N-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-1,2-dimethylcyclopropane-1,2-dicarboximide] as test compounds and to evaluate the ability of the Pesticide Leaching Model (PELMO) to calculate the predicted environmental concentrations of pesticides in air under field conditions. The volatilization rate of procymidone, malathion, and ethoprophos was determined in a field study during two different periods (December 1998 and September 1999) using the Theoretical Profile Shape (TPS) method. The experiments were performed on bare silty soil in the Bologna province, Italy. Residues in the air were continuously monitored for 2 to 3 wk after the pesticide applications. The amount of pesticide volatilized was 16, 5, and 11% in December 1998 and 41, 23, and 19% in September 1999 for procymidone, malathion, and ethoprophos, respectively. In both these experiments, the PELMO simulations of the concentration of ethoprophos and procymidone were in good agreement with the measured data (factor +/- 1.1 on average). The volatilization of malathion was underestimated by a factor of 30 on average. These results suggest that volatilization described by PELMO may be reliable for volatile substances, but PELMO may underpredict volatilization for less-volatile substances.

AB  - The Middle Mississippian Delle phosphatic event marks a significant change in depositional conditions in the Devonian-Mississippian Antler foreland basin of North America. Stratigraphic and petrographic studies show that deposition of Delle-event rocks ended a long period of open-marine carbonate sedimentation when facies shifted to phosphorites, cherts, fine-grained siliciclastics, and lime mudstones from highly productive waters that may have been episodically anoxic. This drastic change in lithology is reflected in the chemistry of the two suites of rocks. delta(18)O values of the Delle-event lime mudstones and phosphatized wackestones-packstones affected by the Delle event are 3-5 parts per thousand lighter than underlying and overlying open marine wackestones-packstones, Sr concentrations of Delle-event lime mudstones and open marine wackestone-packstone facies are low, suggesting that both of these lithologies have undergone similar postdiagenetic alteration. The uniform Sr concentrations and variable delta(18)O data suggest that either the younger Delle-event rocks were exposed to meteoric water during diagenesis or that the relatively light delta(18)O values represent a primary brackish-water depositional signal. Either interpretation is consistent with sedimentological evidence of the Delle event occurring in a predominantly shallow-water setting. delta(13)C values of Delle-event lime mudstones are also anomalously light, indicating a high input of organic carbon during their formation. Mn concentrations of the Delle-event lime mudstones and stratigraphic equivalents are highly variable, suggesting fluctuating oxygen concentrations during their deposition and diagenesis, Rare-earth-element data from phosphorites and cherts of the Delle event indicate oxic to suboxic depositional conditions.

AB  - Ellenberg's indicator values for light, moisture and reaction were tested in deciduous hardwood forests of the Boreo-nemoral zone in Sweden. Weighted averages of indicator values were calculated and correlated with field measurements for two test sets of releves. The best, highly significant correlations were found for reaction, particularly for weighted averages based on vascular plant species. Significant correlations were also found for light, whereas those for moisture were less good and only partly significant. Weighted averages based on presence/absence values and those based on cover/abundance values were generally very similar to each other, but showed differences in their correlations with actual measurements.
   A training set of releves was used to calculate optima and ecological amplitudes of the most common species. Under certain conditions, the original indicator values were replaced by these optima in order to obtain improved indicator values for Swedish deciduous forests. These were correlated with the same test sets of field measurements as the original values and clearly gave better results for light as well as for reaction regarding vascular plants. No clear differences were found for moisture and reaction regarding bryophytes. For the majority of species, the original indicator values also expressed the ecological optima in Swedish deciduous forests as determined by this study. However, several species, most of them preferring more open habitats, showed ecological optima and amplitudes that considerably deviated from central European conditions. In conclusion, Ellenberg's indicator values can successfully be used in south Swedish deciduous forests, particularly after calibration of the values according to regional deviations.

AB  - Although alluvial cutoffs record accurately the geometry, bedforms, and bed material of the channel when last active, few attempts have been made to use cutoffs in studies of channel changes.  A detailed record of historical channel changes on the lower Hunter River in southeastern Australia has shown that this channel responds to naturally alternating periods of high and low flood activity, called flood- and drought-dominated regimes respectively.  Sinuosity decreased from 3.84 in 1870, to 2.66 in 1893 and to 1.38 in 1970 through the development of eight cutoffs.  The channel also aggraded with medium sand burying the former bed material of mixed mud, coarse sand, and gravel.  Channel straightening was a response to increased flood frequencies during the flood-dominated regimes of the late 19th and 20th centuries, combined with localized river engineering works and increased sand load.
   Detailed stratigraphic studies were carried out on three neck cutoffs and one chute cutoff which were abandoned in 1890, 1950, 1952, and 1956.  A comparison of former and present bed elevations and bed material size showed similar trends to those determined by the historical record, confirming the reliability of cutoffs as indicators of former channel conditions.
   The sedimentary infills of the cutoffs are not uniformly fine grained as recorded previously in the literature.  Relatively thin, fine-grained fills were deposited during the drought-dominated regime of the first half of this century but thick, coarser-grained fills were deposited after 1949 during the flood-dominated regime.  All fills fine upwards.  Cutoff infills provide a record of changing flood activity and sediment loads.

AB  - Simple SummaryHorses have to lie down to achieve rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Horses that do not lie down for environmental reasons or pain suffer from an REM sleep deficiency that negatively affects their welfare and health. The present study aimed to assess the influence of chronic orthopedic disease and old age on the time horses lie down. Wearable automated sensor technology was used to monitor the time 83 old and young adult horses with or without chronic lameness spent lying down, moving, or standing. Interestingly, neither age nor lameness due to chronic orthopedic disease significantly influenced the time spent lying down. Horses showing symptoms of REM sleep deficiency had shorter lying times and reduced times spent moving, indicating a general compromise of their well-being. The study shows that wearable sensor technology can be used to identify horses with short recumbency times at risk for REM sleep deficiency. Furthermore, the technology can be used to assess and monitor equine welfare objectively and optimize husbandry conditions so that old horses and horses suffering from chronic orthopedic conditions can achieve lying-down times comparable to younger, healthy horses.Recumbency is a prerequisite for horses achieving rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and completing a full sleep cycle. An inability to lie down due to environmental insecurities or pain results in REM sleep deficiency, which can cause substantial impairment of welfare and health. Therefore, the present study used wearable automated sensor technology on 83 horses housed in an animal sanctuary to measure and compare the recumbency, locomotion, and standing time budgets of geriatric horses with and without chronic lameness to younger adult sound and lame horses. Recumbency times ranged from 0 to 319 min per day with an overall mean of 67.4 (& PLUSMN;61.9) minutes; the time budget for locomotion was 19.1% (& PLUSMN;11.2% s.d.) and for standing 75.6% (& PLUSMN;13.1 s.d.). Interestingly, neither age nor lameness due to chronic orthopedic disease had a significant influence on recumbency times in this study. Eight horses showed symptoms of REM deficit. These horses had significantly shorter lying times (7.99 & PLUSMN; 11.4 min) and smaller locomotion time budgets than the other horses enrolled in this study (73.8 & PLUSMN; 61.8 min), indicating a general compromise of well-being. Thus, wearable sensor technology can be used to identify horses with low recumbency times at risk for REM sleep deficiency and to assess and monitor equine welfare objectively.

AB  - The agrotechnical characterization of lands from the Somesan Plateau targets the knowledge of their restrictions and limitations with the purpose to determine the needs and possibilities of increasing the production capacity, under the conditions of a durable agriculture. The purpose of the paper is the technological characterization of lands and the specification of agrotechnical measures to set up durable agricultural technologies, the determination of indices of characterization of rain aggressiveness (Fournier Index, Modified Fournier Index, A tagot Pluviometric Index), of the best sowing time and the amount of active biological temperatures, as well as the degree of water ensarance of plants during the vegetation period Monitoring and variability of climate elements was achieved during 2014-2018, through a nere ark of 10 HOBO microstations, which store soil temperature data electronically (at 10, 30, 50 cm deep) and air (at 1 m hight), soil moisture (at 10 cm depth, and rain gauges. According to the values of the Fournier Index, 31.81% of the soils fit in low risk of rain erosivity. At the same time, the values of the Modified Fournier Index in most of the stations are between 90-120 and fit in a moderate rain risk of aggressiveness. The percentage analysis of the values of this index shows that 12.5% of the values crorespond to a low rain risk of aggressiveness, 58.33 0 of the values correspond to a moderate rain risk of aggressiveness and 29.16% of the values correspond to a high rain risk of aggressiveness. From the percentage analysis of aver -ages of monthly values of the Angot Index it results that 54.9% of the values are subunit and 45.1% of the values are over unity, indicating the fact that drought intervals prevail over min ones. The analysis of the best solving time leads to the recommendation to maintain the reference internals for the Somesan Playeait thus: maize, 10-25 April; potato, 10-30 March; clover, 1-10 March. An increase of the amount of active biological degrees and the need to remake the zoning ofTl'avorability conditions.fbr certain crops, according to the new microclimate conditions of the area is registered. When it comes to the degree of water ensurance of plants during the vegetation period,for the main crops, one can notice that during 2014-2018, in the case of spring row crops, the water need was ensured during an optimal interval of 57.14% from the vegetation period in the case of maize, of 53.49% in the case of potato of 53.57% in the case of clover and 47.67% in the case of wheat.

AB  - The limited availability of fresh water caused by climate change and global population increase has made research necessary into alternative water sources which are sustainable but of lower quality, in order to meet the demands of agriculture in arid and semi-arid areas. However, there are concerns that irrigation with treated wastewater (TWW) could lead to a deterioration of soil health and a decline in plant yield. The objective of the field study was to determine the effects of medium-term (3-year) irrigation with secondary TWW, fresh water (FW) and a mix of 1:1 TWW/FW (HW) on various microbiological and biochemical soil properties of a Typic Xerofluvent soil and on maize (Zea mays L.) productivity in Mediterranean climatic conditions. In line with this aim, microbial biomass C (MBC), basal soil respiration (BSR) and nitrogen mineralization (N-min), and the activities of the enzymes alkaline phosphatase (ALKPA), dehydrogenase (DHG), beta-glucosidase (GLU), aryl sulphatase (ArSA) and urease (UA) were determined. In addition, the grain yield of maize was measured. Taking three-year averages into account, it was found that although all biological dependent variables measured in connection to the application of TWW had been affected in a range of 2% to -11% (mean 3%), the differences created by the use of FW did not reach the level of statistical significance. With the application of HW, a significant and more severe reduction of -19% (P<0.05) was found. The application of TWW increased only ALKPA and ArSA activity, by 4% and 2%, respectively, and this result was found not to be significant. Even though the effect of TWW on soil health was not found to be significant, a negative effect was found on the grain yield of maize plants (P<0.05) at a level of 17% (1.68 t ha(-1)). The fact that no significant effect was found of the TWW used in this study conducted under Mediterranean climatic conditions on soil health is an indicator of its potential long-term use with different crops and different irrigation techniques. Furthermore, it has been proved that the re-use of treated wastewater, which has an effect close to that of fresh water, can be an important part of the integrated management of water resources, and is a reliable alternative water source, which can provide an effective solution in conditions of water shortage.

AB  - A lack of stratigraphical, sedimentological and geochemical data for sediment accumulation rates and indicators of productivity and anoxia means that causative models for ancient black shales are largely inferred from modern settings. Coastal upwelling has been suggested as a general hypothesis for Ordovician black shale deposition within the Iapetus Ocean. but has not been directly tested. Despite anchizone metamorphism we utilize a suite of geological and geochemical environmental proxy data (TOC Wt.%, delta C-13(org), Ba/Al, P) to elucidate the mechanism for the origin of a single grey-black shale cycle within the upper Katian succession of the Welsh Basin. Here we interpret organic carbon (OC)-rich deposition to be suggestive of a period of high photic productivity (higher TOC wt.%), with C-12 and Ba enrichment, comparable to high productivity events in modern coastal upwelling systems. Productivity proxy values are consistent with those from margins where sedimentation rates are high (e.g. Gulf of California). Inter-bedded grey shales have low TOC wt.% more positive delta C-13(org) and marginally lower Ba and are interpreted as low productivity events. Thalassinoides, Planolites and Chondrites ichnofacies indicate changing seafloor oxygen levels. These show predominantly dysoxic conditions even during the deposition of OC-poor grey shales. During an OC-rich laminated hemipelagite event, oxygen levels declined at the sea floor before the deposition of the OC-rich layers. Full anoxia was established early on in the deposition of OC-rich layers and the return to more oxic conditions was rapid though fluctuating and coincident with the return of grey shale deposition. This pattern suggests OC accumulation at the seafloor resulted from a complex interaction of productivity and preservation. None of the widely used trace element redox proxies are reliable in anchizone metamorphic rocks. Climate sensitive detrital proxies (K/Al and Ti/Al) indicate arid-temperate conditions in the basin hinterland during the deposition of the OC-rich layers. The Welsh Basin was situated on the southern margin of the Iapetus Ocean in (30 degrees S) beneath the prevailing SE trade winds. We interpret the occurrence of OC-rich laminated hemipelagite events to represent the intensification of upwelling, prior to the Himantian glaciation, possibly having resulted from a strengthening of the trade winds, associated with stepped changes in ice volume, and a more and local climate.

AB  - Elucidation of the mechanisms of dehydration tolerance in poplar (Populus sp.) trees will permit development of biochemical and molecular indicators to identify dehydration-tolerant genotypes during genetic selection. The objectives of this study were to characterize the degree of phenotypic variation in osmotic potential (a determinant of dehydration tolerance), determine the relationship between osmotic potential at full turgor and relative growth rate, and identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for osmotic potential in an advanced-generation, interspecific poplar pedigree established in contrasting environments. A three-generation, sib-mated black cotton-wood (Populus trichocarpa Torr. & Gray) and eastern cotton-wood (P. deltoides Bartr.) segregating F-2 family (Family 331) was analyzed at a dry site east of the Cascade Mountain Range (Boardman, OR) and at a wet site west of the mountains (Clatskanie, OR). At the Boardman site, 2-year-old trees (59 clones) were either irrigated everyday (wet) or every other day (dry), whereas 3- and 4-year-old trees (58 clones) at the Clatskanie site were unirrigated.
   At the Boardman site, the typically narrow range of osmotic potentials exhibited by grandparents and parents was greatly expanded in the F-2 population, spanning from -1.38 to -2.35 MPa under wet conditions, with a similar range under dry conditions (-1.40 to -2.15 MPa). Clones that had osmotic potentials <= -1.90 MPa generally displayed full maintenance of stem relative growth rates under dry conditions in contrast to clones with osmotic potentials that were >= -1.60 MPa, in which stem relative growth rates were reduced by an average of 38% in the dry treatment relative to the wet treatment. Although osmotic adjustments of 0.13 to 0.36 MPa were observed in nine out of 59 clones, adjustment typically occurred from relatively high baseline osmotic potentials. The range in osmotic potential at the wetter Clatskanie site at age three was higher (-1.27 to -1.84 MPa) and was further expanded the following year (-1.14 to -1.94 MPa), which had a wetter spring than the previous year, followed by a typically dry July. Seven QTL for osmotic potential were identified that each explained > 7.5% of the variation in osmotic potential. Given that four clones (7%) had osmotic potentials of -2.00 MPa or less and that QTL for osmotic potential have been identified, we suggest that there are opportunities to extend the limit of dehydration tolerance in Populus.

AB  - In Germany, bank-filtered raw water and ground water is mainly used for drinking water conditioning. Microorganisms, which are neither retarded by the subsoil passage of the bank-filtration, nor by the different filtration and disinfection steps at the water works, cause the growth of biofilms on different materials originally used in drinking water distribution systems. The development, the phylogenetical diversity and the bacterial metabolic activities of biofilms on polyethylen (PE-HD), polyvinyl chlorid (PVC), steel and copper were analyzed at different sampling points. The incubation experiments were performed under natural conditions using a flow device technique. The devices were installed after the activated carbon filters and disinfection step at the water works and at two different house branch connections within the distribution system of the conditioned drinking water of the water works. The synthetic materials were colonized very rapidly within a few days in significant higher densities than steel and copper. The total bacterial cell counts of the biofilms were measured by DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. The metabolic activities of the bacteria were quantified by the use of the redox dye CTC (5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride); which is frequently described as an indicator for respiration. The highest respiratory activities were observed in biofilms from synthetic materials grown after the activated carbon filters at the water works. A significant reduction of the total bacterial cell counts and respiratory activities of about 80% was measured due to the disinfection at the water works. A time dependent growth of bacteria in biofilms was observed at the two sampling points within the distribution system, whereas the percentage of CTC-reducing cells stabilized at 35%. The in situ-hy bridizations with fluorescence labelled, group-specific rRNA targeted oligonucleotide probes revealed the following: (i) bacteria of the Beta- and Gamma-subclass of Proteobacteria were found most frequently within the biofilm population, (ii) the percentage of the different subclasses depended on the used material, (iii) there were no significant changes in bacterial subclass composition of the biofilms taken from the water works and house branch connections. In addition, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), southern blot hybridization and in situ hybridization were used to detect facultative pathogenic bacteria in biofilms. Non-pneumophila Legionella were found in a relative high percentage up to about 7% in many biofilms, whereas fecal streptococci were detected only in few biofilms of the drinking water distribution systems (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The aim of the article is to analyze the industrialization process of the emergence of the industrial appearance of a provincial Siberian city during the first five-year plan (1928- 1932) on Tyumen materials.
   The article is based on archival documents, materials of periodicals and sources of personal origin, first used for scientific purposes. The 1928-1932 five-year plan was shown to be the first large-scale planning and industrial development experience in the history of Tyumen. Serious obstacles to industrial modernization were the lack of reliable sources of financing, low technical equipment of enterprises, a narrow construction base of production, an acute shortage of skilled labor and specialists. Under these conditions, large-scale economic construction and modernization of production in Tyumen, however, as in other regions of the country, was carried out by "transferring" funds from the agricultural sector of the economy and increasing the intensity of labor of workers and employees. The most common forms of labor intensification have become shock brigades (udarniki), overtime working, increasing the rate of work.
   Among the four years and three months of the Tyumen Five-Year Plan, only its first year was relatively good. The situation changed at the beginning of 1930, when the already intense tasks were revised and significantly increased. New benchmarks created a fundamentally different economic situation and exacerbated the problem of sources of industrialization. These circumstances could not but affect the economic results of the five-year plan. According to official data, industrial production in Tyumen increased by 182.5%, and the initial planned targets were fulfilled ahead of schedule. However, analysis of the work of industrial enterprises of the city suggests that real growth rates of urban industrial production did not correspond to official data calculated on the basis of cost indicators of manufactured products, which increased in conditions of increased inflation, and in reality amounted to 70-80%.
   It has been established that the chosen development strategy made it possible to take an important step towards the industrial development of Tyumen. At the same time, the industrial transformation of the late 1920s and early 1930s was accompanied by an exacerbation of social problems, an increase in disproportions in the development of the urban environment, which retained the traditional look, only partially affected by the modernization process. Under current conditions, the industrial sphere, the urban environment and everyday life represented a symbiosis of traditional and modern elements. Interlacing into specific structures, they gave the process of modernization a controversial and fragmentary character.

AB  - Droughts and heatwaves in the Mediterranean can induce plant activity decline and severe wildfires leading to considerable economic, social and environmental damages. This study aims at statistically quantifying the isolated and combined impacts of these extreme events based on a combination of regional land surface-atmosphere modeling and satellite observations of surface properties (MODIS). A simulation by the RegIPSL coupled regional model (ORCHIDEE-WRF) over the 1979-2016 period in the Western Mediterranean is used to identify heatwaves and droughts. After an evaluation of the model performance against surface observations of temperature and precipitation, a spatio-temporal analysis is conducted using specific indicators of extreme events: Percentile Limit Anomalies (PLA) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The impact on vegetation and wildfires is assessed using the MODIS observations of Leaf Area Index (LAI), burned area (BA) and fire radiative power (FRP), clustered by simulated extreme weather events. Due to water stress, droughts lead to significant biomass decrease (- 10% LAI on average and reaching - 23% in some areas). The isolated effect of heatwaves is smaller (similar to- 3% LAI) so that the combined effect is dominated by the impact of droughts. Heatwaves and droughts significantly exacerbate wildfire regimes. Through synergistic effects, simultaneous droughts and heatwaves increase BA and FRP by 2.1 and 2.9 times, respectively, compared to normal conditions. By reducing biomass, droughts slightly decrease fuel availability. However, our results show that the inter-annual variation in fire activity is mainly driven by weather conditions rather than fuel load.

AB  - Environmental contamination is reaching ever higher levels and affecting several animal populations, including humans. In this context, studies are being developed to monitor and evaluate this environmental problem using bioindicators organisms, in addition to testing the toxicity of contaminants in the laboratory. In this perspective, reptiles are ideal animals for these types of studies, considering that they are ectothermic and have a slower metabolism directly influencing their recovery power, and therefore, they are more sensitive to xenobiotic effects. Among reptiles, lizards are animals that adapt to various environmental conditions, even being found in areas with arid characteristics. Therefore, a literature review was conducted in this study regarding the use of lizards as models for ecotoxicological studies, including biomonitoring, carried out in the last 10 years, with the aim of evaluating them as bioindicators in Brazilian semi-arid region. Studies were found involving ten lizard families, among which the most investigated was Lacertidae. The studies were classified into two categories: organic contaminants (pesticides, petroleum by-products, and explosives) and inorganic contaminants (metals such as zinc, lead and aluminum, and radionuclides). Contaminants directly contributed to DNA damage and to increasing the frequency of micronuclei in exposed animals, histopathological effects, and oxidative stress. The performed analysis highlights the usefulness of lizards as environmental biomonitors. However, the response profile is dependent on the exposure level and route, in addition to the environmental scenario analyzed. Therefore, future studies aimed at evaluating environmental contaminants are required under exposure conditions more related to the environmental reality to be studied.

AB  - A new mathematical modelling framework for simulation of metal cyclic plasticity is proposed and experimental validation based on tension-compression cyclic testing of S355J2 low carbon structural steel presented over the two parts of this paper. The advantages and limitations of the stress-strain curve shape modelling given by "Armstrong and Frederick" type hardening rules are discussed and a new formulation for kinematic hardening is proposed for more accurate representation of the stress-strain dependence under cyclic loading conditions. The proposed model is shown to describe the shape of the stress-strain curve accurately under various different loading conditions. Transition effects occurring at loading reversals are incorporated through a new framework of Dirac delta functions. In addition to the yield surface, stress supersurfaces able to expand and instantly move to simulate a shift of stress-strain curves during loading reversals are determined. This also enables inclusion of the behaviour of monotonic stress-strain curves with yield plateau deformation in one mathematical model. The influence of the first stress invariant on the shape of a stress-strain curve in tension and compression directions observed in many metals is incorporated into the kinematic hardening rule. The ability of the model to accurately describe transition from elastic to elastic-plastic deformation at small offset strain yield points naturally accounts for nonlinearity of an unloading stress-strain curve after plastic pre-strain. Development of the model to include mixed cyclic hardening/softening, ratcheting and mean stress relaxation is presented in a companion paper (Part II), which includes experimental validation of the modelling framework.

AB  - For decades, maintenance of facilities and equipment, as well as related activities (from fault detection to prognostics and health management), has a proven impact on efficiency of production systems and is thus still the subject of numerous developments (from corrective to proactive maintenance). These developments are supported by the increase in digital pervasiveness accompanying the Industry 4.0. concept, based in particular on the use of Cyber-Physical Systems. In addition, we are witnessing the growing interest of the political and academic world and public opinion with regard to the sustainable impact of human activity. For company decision-makers, triple bottom line accounting frameworks have been introduced at higher decision levels (strategic) based on economic, social, and environmental performance indicators. This triple preoccupation has not yet been integrated into studies on middle (tactical) and lower (operational) decision levels, and paradoxically, not into production facility health management either. In this paper, we propose the deployment of a framework helping decisions makers to be environmentally aware in the maintenance of cyber physical systems. This framework consists of three key elements: a new maintenance policy called Sustainable Condition-Based Maintenance (SCBM), which requires the assessment of the Remaining Sustainable Life (RSL) as a key indicator; an adaptation and extension of a generic prognostic business process initially proposed for traditional Conditions Based Maintenance (CBM); and an organization adapted to the prognosis of the environmental performance of systems, based on holonic structures. We present the implementation of such a framework on a real Cyber Physical Systems under development.

AB  - Automation of the measurement of the physiological and behavioural parameters of livestock has become an important goal for both scientists and fanners. Accurate data and knowledge about farmed animals, especially in cattle breeding, are needed. Proper early diagnosis of a cow's health status in real time allows for preventing the development of infection, oestrus detection and leads to reduced environmental stress. Thus, it contributes to more effective herd management. Among the physiological parameters, body temperature and its fluctuations are key indicators of health and well-being in animals. Currently, along with the development of technical solutions and their implementation, increasingly more attention is being paid to the continuously measurement of body core and peripheral temperature in animals. Recently there has been an increased number of publications devoted to this subject. However, there is a need to systematise this knowledge as these studies have had different purposes, have been performed in various environmental conditions, and the measurements were taken using different methods and equipment. As such, the results obtained by the different authors often may not be comparable. For this reason, this paper has two main purposes: to present the most widely used continuous methods of peripheral and body core temperature measurement, and to show its references values which characterise the individual locations of the cattle body in thermoneutral ambient. An analysis of the professional publications regarding measurements of peripheral and deep body temperature led to the conclusion that these methods have high research and diagnostic potential. However, it is necessary to standardised research to enable better and more comparable results, including among others; different cattle groups, animal age, health and environmental conditions.

AB  - An extensive oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) occurs in the northeastern (NE) Arabian Sea where sedimentary records show evidence of alternating strong and weak OMZs that correlate with North Atlantic climate variability during the last glacial-interglacial cycle. OMZs are expanding world-wide, but information on long-term OMZ-ecosystem interactions is mainly limited to fossilized species, notably foraminifera. Here, we provide a first comprehensive ancient sedimentary DNA record of both fossilizing and non-fossilizing protists and their response to OMZ variability in the NE Arabian Sea over the last 43 ka. Protist communities changed significantly during strong vs. weak OMZ conditions coincident with interstadials and stadials respectively. Dinoflagellates were identified as significant indicator taxa for strong OMZs during glacial as well as interglacial interstadials, whereas diatoms were significant indicators for strong OMZs only during glacial interstadials. The chlorophyte Chlorella was found to be the main phototrophic protist in nutrient-depleted surface waters during glacial stadials. Notably, strong OMZ conditions shaped past protist communities by creating isolated habitats for those capable of sustaining oxygen depletion either by adapting a parasitic life cycle (e.g. apicomplexans) or by establishing mutualistic connections with others (e.g. radiolarians and mixotrophic dinoflagellates) or by forming cysts (e.g. colpodeans). Notably, a long-term increase in eutrophication and a decrease in the diatom/dinoflagellate ratio was observed during the late Holocene favoring the pelagic component of the marine food web. A similar scenario could be expected in the context of predicted worldwide expansion of coastal OMZs associated with global climate change. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a disinfection byproduct (DBP) of health concern with high precursor concentrations in wastewater effluents. Wastewater-derived NDMA precursor sorption was evaluated with both batch and column tests using a range of activated carbon (AC) types and operational conditions. NDMA and other DBP (trihalomethane, haloacetic acid, and haloacetonitrile) precursor removal, assessed using formation potential (FP) conditions, was evaluated relative to organic matter (OM) characteristics. In batch tests, lignite-and wood-based powdered ACs (PACs) achieved significantly better removal than bituminous-and coconut-based PACs. At a 5 mg L-1 dose, lignite-and wood-based PAC removed >95% of NDMA FP, while bituminous-and coconut-based PACs removed 67% and 53%, respectively. Mesoporous ACs performed better than microporous ACs. Proportional diffusivity designed rapid small-scale column tests (RSSCTs) with the lignite-based GAC effectively removed NDMA precursors at both 10- and 20 minute empty-bed contact times, at levels significantly better than bulk OM and the other DBP precursors. NDMA precursors exhibited linear mass-balance behavior during column runs with wastewater blends. Overall, NDMA precursors adsorbed independently from other DBP precursors and standard OM measures (e.g., TOC, UVA) in batch and column tests, showing similarities to micropollutant adsorption. Fluorescence spectroscopy OM indicators, however, showed similar adsorption behavior as NDMA precursors in column tests. Correlations using overall fluorescence intensity were developed that may be used as predictive tools for wastewater-derived NDMA precursor removal. A model based on the RSSCT results effectively predicted NDMA precursor adsorption of pilot-scale results for the same wastewater effluent and three other external data sets.

AB  - Investigations of interactions between climate change and humans suffer from the lack of climate proxies directly linked to historical or archaeological datasets that describe past environmental conditions at a particular location and time. We present a new set of pine tree-ring records (Pinus sylvestris L) developed from burial timbers excavated at the historical center of Yaroslavl city, Russia. A 171 year delta C-13 tree-ring chronology from AD 1430 to AD 1600 evidences mostly wet summers during the 15th century but exceptionally dry conditions of the 16th century at the Upper Volga catchment. According to the tree-ring record there were four major droughts (<-1.5 sigma) lasting from 9 to 26 years: 1501-1517, 1524-1533, 1542-1555 and 1570-1596, and major pluvials (>+1.5 sigma) lasting from 70 to 5 years: 1430-1500, 1518-1523, 1534-1541, and 1556-1564. We discuss a plausible contribution of these droughts to crop failures and city fires documented with historical chronicles for the Upper Volga catchment. The devastating drought regime of the 16th century corresponds to the loss of independence of the Yaroslavl principality to the Grand Duchy of Moscow and the formation of the centralized Russian State during the reign of Ivan the Terrible (1533-1584) underpinning the emergence of the Russian Empire. This study substantiates the value of archaeological timbers from the oldest Russian cities and inclusion of stable carbon isotope analysis for understanding hydroclimatic regimes across the mid latitudes of East European Plain, and their relationship to the history of Russia.

AB  - The chemo-enzymatic epoxidation of the terpene beta-caryophyllene is reported herein. This compound can form two products, the mono-epoxide 2 and the di-epoxide 3. Different experimental conditions, varying the source of the lipases (including mycelia from the Amazon region), the oxidizing agents (H2O2 aq. (AHP) or urea-hydrogen peroxide (UHP)) and the substituted acyl donors on the alkyl chain (bromide and alkyl), along with the influence of organic medium, were evaluated. Depending on the experimental conditions the formation of a single product could be obtained. CAL-B was the most efficient catalyst (conv. >99%). When using the commercial lipases product 2 was obtained in conversions of 16-27%, and using the native lipases 2 was obtained in conversions of 20-23%. With the use of mycelia UEA_06 and UEA_53 the conversions were 16 and 21%, respectively. When the 2-bromo alkylated and 2-ethylhexanoic acids were used as acyl donors only the mono-epoxide 2 was obtained in conversions of 14-54% (24 h). AHP was found to be a better oxidizing agent than UHP, a shorter time and lower amount being required to obtain 2 or 3 as the sole product in good conversions (60 up to >99%). The organic solvents were also selective. When using n-hexane the preferred formation of 2 was observed with >99% conversion, and when ethyl acetate or toluene were used the conversion to 3 was also >99% (in 8 and 24 h, respectively).

AB  - Ecological indicators for monitoring strategies are expected to combine three major characteristics: ecological significance, statistical credibility, and cost-effectiveness. Strategies based on stranding networks rank highly in cost-effectiveness, but their ecological significance and statistical credibility are disputed. Our present goal is to improve the value of stranding data as population indicator as part of monitoring strategies by constructing the spatial and temporal null hypothesis for strandings. The null hypothesis is defined as: small cetacean distribution and mortality are uniform in space and constant in time. We used a drift model to map stranding probabilities and predict stranding patterns of cetacean carcasses under H-0 across the North Sea, the Channel and the Bay of Biscay, for the period 1990-2009. As the most common cetacean occurring in this area, we chose the harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena for our modelling. The difference between these strandings expected under H-0 and observed strandings is defined as the stranding anomaly. It constituted the stranding data series corrected for drift conditions. Seasonal decomposition of stranding anomaly suggested that drift conditions did not explain observed seasonal variations of porpoise strandings. Long-term stranding anomalies increased first in the southern North Sea, the Channel and Bay of Biscay coasts, and finally the eastern North Sea. The hypothesis of changes in porpoise distribution was consistent with local visual surveys, mostly SCANS surveys (1994 and 2005). This new indicator could be applied to cetacean populations across the world and more widely to marine megafauna.

AB  - The half-loss time (HLT) is used as an indicator to quantify gas leakage rates during methyl bromide (MB) and sulfuryl fluoride (SF) fumigations. Comparisons of HLTs between three MB and three SF fumigations were quantified in the Hal Ross pilot flour mill, Department of Grain Science and Industry, Kansas State University, USA. The sealing quality or gas tightness of the mill before each fumigation was verified by a pressurization test. Fumigant concentrations during the six fumigations were monitored continuously at 30 locations among the five mill floors during the 24 h fumigation period. A weather station on the mill roof monitored barometric pressure, wind speed and direction, temperature, and relative humidity. A data logger on each mill floor recorded temperature and relative humidity. The pressurization test showed that the relationship between airflow rate and building static pressure varied among the fumigations despite the same areas being sealed by two separate fumigation service providers due to environmental conditions not being identical among the fumigations. Concentration differences of both fumigants within the mill ranged from 2 to 7 g/m(3). The observed HLTs for the MB and SF fumigations were in the range of 3.61 to 28.64 h and 9.97 to 31.65 h, respectively, and were inversely related only to wind speeds during fumigation and not any other environmental conditions recorded. In our study, the fumigant leakage rate was found to be predominantly a function of wind speed rather than inherent gas characteristics of MB and SF. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Growth and morphometric characteristics of the caridean Palaemon longirostris Milne Edwards, 1837, were studied in the Gironde estuary population. Their first comparison with earlier studies in this estuary and in the Mira River provided the first step towards developing environmental indicators using a species represented at the European scale. Mean individual growth was modelled for each sex using the classical von Bertalanffy growth model and the seasonal model that integrates periods of lower growth. Morphometric relationships, in particular the spatio-temporal variability in the relative weight of individuals, were explored according to sex and physical parameters of the environment. Females grew to larger size than males. Growth estimates showed the importance of accounting for the seasonal variations to evaluate non-biased growth. Sex and the presence of eggs for females showed significant interaction within the carapace length - total length relation as well as for the carapace length - weight relation. Body condition was significantly greater in spring and summer for both sexes and was significantly correlated with salinity, but only for males. Comparison with the Mira River was limited to the range of data available. However, the population of the Gironde estuary, being similar in both recent and historical studies, showed morphometric differences when compared to that of the Mira River. Indeed, the growth performance index was higher in the Gironde estuary and likely linked to temperature constraints. Conversely, differences between males and females were much higher in the Mira River than in the Gironde estuary.

AB  - Background and Aims: This paper describes the changes in temperature-based indices used to classify viticultural climates in Australia for three warming scenarios produced by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation: Mk3.0 global climate model for the years 2030, 2050 and 2070.
   Methods and Results: Temperature indices that describe grapevine growing season temperature (GST), ripening period temperature, accumulated biologically effective degree days and growing season length were calculated to produce maps of Australia for each warming scenario. Summary statistics of each index's median and range are presented for each Australian wine region under each warming scenario. The greatest change in GST (above the 1971-2000 mean) was modelled to occur for the Perth Hills region, increasing by 1.0 degrees C by 2030, 1.9 degrees C by 2050 and 2.7 degrees C by 2070. The least change in GST was modelled to occur for the Kangaroo Island region, increasing by 0.5 degrees C by 2030, 0.9 degrees C by 2050 and 1.3 degrees C by 2070.
   Conclusion: Of the 61 recognised wine regions, a median GST of over 21 C (an indicator of the limit of quality wine grape production conditions) was found for three regions for the period 1971-2000, for eight regions for the 2030 scenario, 12 regions for the 2050 scenario and 21 regions for the 2070 scenario.
   Significance of the Study: Without appropriate adaptations, some established viticultural regions of Australia may become less suitable for quality winegrape production, whereas regions that were once considered unsuitable for quality winegrape production may become more suitable.

AB  - A fully predictive, algebraic method has been developed for the prediction of the timewise temperature variation of a thermal load situated in an electrically heated oven. The model which underlies the method takes into account both natural convection within the oven cavity and radiation between the thermal load and the oven walls. The model provides a complete description of heat transfer external to the thermal load. It can be used to provide boundary conditions for an analysis of thermal loads of various heat-conducting characteristics. This method is able to accommodate loads of various shapes, sizes, materials, and radiation surface finishes, as well as oven heating conditions characterized by a wide range of oven set-point temperatures. Extensive experiments were performed to validate the predictive method. These experiments encompassed thermal loads of different shapes, masses, and surface finishes. Measurements were made of the transient response of the thermal load. The results of these experiments reveal overall agreement to within about 1% between the predictions and the data, thereby validating the veracity of the assumptions that underlie the predictive model. Encompassing temperature data were collected at 170 sites on the oven walls. These data have been brought together in the form of isotherms. Among the walls, the temperatures on the oven door were the lowest, whereas the highest temperatures were encountered on the oven floor and on the top wall. Thermal symmetry was found to prevail on most of the walls, with the greatest deviations from symmetry in evidence on the sidewalls. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Subadult scurvy is not well documented in archeological human remains despite the existence of many biomedical references indicating that bone changes do occur in some cases and, because of this, should be observable in human burials. There are several potential reasons for this gap in our knowledge of scurvy. Not all children who suffered from scurvy died of the disease or from other causes when they had scurvy Scurvy may not leave characteristic bone changes in every case of the disease. Some of the pathological conditions associated with scurvy have been known for many years, but these features may be rare or difficult to differentiate from other pathological conditions. Recently a lesion of the skull has been described (Ortner and Ericksen [1997] International Journal of Osteoarchaeology 7:212-220) that is probably pathognomonic for scurvy specifically porous and sometimes hypertrophic lesions of the greater wing of the sphenoid, This lesion is bilateral and highly associated with evidence of inflammation at other anatomical sites in the skull. A survey of subadult skulls (N = 363) in the human skeletal collection from Peru at the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, reveals a prevalence of 10% of skulls that exhibit plausible evidence of scurvy. Some cases of scurvy also have cribra orbitalia that has been attributed to anemia. In most BE the Peruvian scurvy cases, anemia is an unlikely possibility because there is no evidence of marrow hyperplasia. This highlights the need for caution in using lesions of the orbit as an indicator of anemia when there is no other evidence of this disease elsewhere in the skeleton. Anatomical evidence of scurvy offers the potential of providing new and important evidence of diet in archeological human populations. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The socio-economic situation in Ukraine suggests that there is insufficient research into the applicability of the model of economic development in forecasting the economic environment in which trade enterprises function. Researchers into issues relating to the efficiency of enterprises' functioning focus their interest on comprehensively describing efficiency indicators and determining the factors influencing it. There continues to be insufficient work on measuring efficiency and the extent to which it is limited by types of economic growth (development), based on the theory of marginal product of George Clark and the results of multiple models of production and trade functions (P. Douglas, R. Solow, E. Denison, Harrod, Samuelson-Hicks, Domar and others). Therefore, this study focuses on the process of assessing the effectiveness of trading enterprises in the trade sector in 2010-18 in conditions of economic growth and an economic downturn. This article aims to examine the models of efficient functioning of trading enterprises in conditions of economic growth. It is evidenced that the criterion for measuring efficiency is the evaluation of static and dynamic efficiency of trade activities, which allows changes in the used assets to be taken into account and testifies to the integration of diminishing returns and economic fluctuations in macro and microsystems. The article shows that in order to qualitatively and completely evaluate the efficiency of the functioning of trading enterprises, it is necessary to consider all possible factors. According to Clark's law, the authors substantiate an approach to evaluating performance based on simple one-factor models; the approach evidences that future studies seeking ways to improve efficiency, but that focus on changes in resources, will be erroneous, unjustified, and will most likely reduce the effectiveness of the resource under study. This model will help: determine and forecast the efficiency of enterprises at any point in the economic cycle; provide the necessary information on the required amount of investment, on depreciation rates, and on the optimal amount of labour potential of an enterprise; and define the volume of expected income during economic crisis or recovery. Some applied recommendations in terms of managing the efficiency of trading enterprises are aimed at solving the methodological problem of constructing isoquant maps for a particular product line group and at selecting the optimal predictor for forecasting trade processes. The practical value of the proposed model also lies in improving the parameters of positioning of the enterprise's goods in target market segments, reducing operating costs, accelerating the turnover of inventories and withdrawing illiquid current assets, and increasing the efficiency of retail areas.

AB  - Purpose - Extant literature indicates that increased product market diversification generates both positive and negative impact on firm performance. This inconclusive pattern hinders the decision-making of deploying a firm's resources across different markets. This research aims to embed diversification into a moderation-based framework and demonstrates the conditions under which increased diversification produces either beneficial or harmful effects on firm outcomes. The authors introduce another market configuration dimension, viz., market emphasis, and reveal how changes in diversification and in emphasis yield interactive effects on an important firm performance indicator, idiosyncratic risk. An additional moderator, market turbulence, is also incorporated to further enrich the model in a three-way interaction. Results show that when market turbulence is high, and a firm highly skews its resources to some of its markets, diversifying into more market domains will increase firm idiosyncratic risk. A better choice during increased diversification is to evenly emphasize each of its markets. However, in a market displaying low turbulence, the high diversification-high emphasis pattern may be preferred because of lower firm risk.
   Design/methodology/approach - To test the hypotheses, the authors collected a comprehensive archival data that contained a large group of public traded US-based manufacturing companies from three different resources. These were the Compustat Annual Database, the Center for Research in Security Prices database and Compustat Business Segment Database. These databases and the combinatorial approach are widely adopted in marketing and management research involving firm strategies and financial outcomes.
   Findings - When market turbulence is high, simultaneously increasing market diversification and emphasis will more strongly raise firm idiosyncratic risk. However, polarizing into either diversification or emphasis reduces firm risk. When in a low turbulence market, expanding to more product markets and simultaneously emphasizing key markets will decrease idiosyncratic risk. One noticeable fact is that irrespective of whether a firm is in high or low turbulence conditions, choosing a diversification strategy always decreases firm risk when market emphasis is low. However, the impact of this effect however is higher when turbulence is greater. The authors also present the boundary conditions under which the three-way interaction holds.
   Research limitations/implications - First, the extension to the utilization of idiosyncratic risk stretches the understanding of effective ways of reducing firm risks from an angle of marketing management. This view of firm risk also contributes to further analysis of shareholder value. Classic corporate asset valuation focuses more on the financial performance indicators as well as the firm's strategic domains. This research thus provides a unique and meaningful guideline for the corporate valuation approach from the angle of analyzing the firm's business segment scope and emphasis in the context of the environment.
   Practical implications - The idea about how many product markets a firm should enter is always one of the primary decisions that contain significant trade-offs. This makes the managers choice difficult during the decision-making processes. The authors suggest that managers should not only consider the scope of product markets but also think carefully about the resources allocated toward each segment. A matrix with dimensions of diversification and emphasis can be explicitly studied during the strategy formulation. The individual blocks within this matrix may have significant outcome differences.
   Originality/value - Previous research focuses on either a firm's internal assets or external competitive situations when researchers seek the drivers of risk-reduction. This research extends this horizon by adding the interplay between a set of fundamental firm decision areas, diversification and emphasis and the external conditions facing a firm (turbulence).

AB  - Many water providers monitor adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as an indicator of biological acclimation of their biofilters; however, strong correlations between ATP concentration and filter performance (e.g., organic matter or disinfection by-product precursor removal) are not typically observed. As an alternative, this study evaluated the use of enzyme activity for monitoring biological processes within filters. Recent studies have proposed that enzyme activity may be used as an indicator of biofilter function as it provides a means to quantify biodegradation which may allow for a more accurate measure of degradation potential and to gain a better understanding of biofilter performance. Sampling was completed from full- and pilot-scale biofilters to assess impacts associated with pre-treatments, varying sources waters, as well as pre-treatment and operating conditions. Enzyme activity (carboxylic esterase, phosphatase, ss-glucosidase, alpha-glucosidase, ss-xylosidase, chitinase, and cellulase) and ATP were measured from the top 5 cm of biofilter media representative of typical full-scale sampling; water quality parameters included dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and disinfection by-products (DBPs): trihalomethane (THM) formation potential (FP), and haloacetic acid FP (HAA FP). Results confirmed that ATP was not a reliable monitoring tool for DOC and DBP FP reduction in biofilters. A strong relationship was observed between esterase activity and DOC reduction; chitinase activity significantly correlated to THM FP reduction for filters treating three different source waters and HAA FP reduction achieved by filters treating the same source water with a range of pre-treatment and backwash conditions. This study showed that enzyme activity may be appropriate for monitoring biological processes within drinking water filters and may act as a surrogate for the removal of organic compounds.

AB  - This study traces coastal sand dune development processes in East Asia during the Holocene to understand climate and environmental changes. We used optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating to examine periods of activation and stabilization of dunes along the western coast of the Korean Peninsula. The results from the Taean Chollipo, Seocheon Dasari, and Gochang Sabanri dunes were then compared with those from previous studies to establish a broad understanding of coastal dune development in this region. Sedimentation rates were calculated for the three dunes, and their development periods were classified through statistical analysis that included data from previous studies. We defined five main periods of late Holocene dune development (<0.1 ka, 0.2-0.5 ka, 1.2-2.0 ka, 2.5-3.2 ka, and 5.5-6.5 ka). These correlated to periods of sea level decrease and global cooling determined by ice rafted debris records. We concluded that the development of coastal dunes in western Korea was influenced by sea level decreases, and global cooling events were enhanced by the East Asian winter monsoon. In addition, human activity increases also contributed to the development of the dunes. This study showed how coastal sand dunes can be evaluated as important indicators of global climate change. These results improved our understanding of how paleoclimate changes affected environmental conditions in East Asia and how coastal dune development periods can be used to reconstruct paleo-environmental conditions.

AB  - Buildings generate a significant amount of waste that has considerable impacts on environment and energy flow. This study aims to investigate the waste capacity of the selected district and its effect on the environment within the current waste management policy via Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology based on the two indicators; global warming potential and energy flow. The district has 82 buildings with 64,971m2 total gross area and 2,000 populations. Accordingly, the district's waste capacity was evaluated within the classification of Municipal Solid Wastes (MSW), liquid wastes, and demolition wastes.
   The system boundaries of the LCA were set based on the gate-to-grave approach, which includes generated wastes during the lifespan of the buildings, including their end-of-life stage. Consequently, energy recovery potentials from waste processes were investigated and compared with the primary energy demand of the operational energy consumption of the buildings to perceive the amount of energy compensation range.
   Additionally, buildings' physical conditions, which obtained from their Building Information Models (BIM), energy performances, derived from their energy models and local specifications, obtained from standards were utilized to identify the current conditions and waste management systems. Critically, the outcomes of all those were used as input data for the LCA model.
   The results showed that there had been energy recovery potentials from MSW's treatments, while liquid wastes and demolishing wastes treatments have consumed energy. Energy recovery potential from MSW has compensated only 5.8% of operational energy annually, which came from recycling processes. Also, all waste management systems release greenhouse gases to the atmosphere that cause global warming. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the regional impacts of heavy metals (Mn, Fe, Mg, Ca, Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr, Pb and Ni) on water, sediment and a native, teleost fish species, Labeo angra, inhabiting a flood plain wetland of Barak River in Assam, India. Heavy metal concentrations in the water, sediments and fish were measured; bioaccumulation factor, metal pollution index as well as condition indices were calculated, to assess the pollution load and health status of the fish. Multivariate statistical analysis was used on wetland water and sediment heavy metals to ascertain the possible sources and seasonal variations of the pollutants. Results showed that most heavy metals in the wetland water and sediments exceeded the water (drinking and irrigation) and sediment quality guidelines, respectively. Seasonal variations were observed for geogenic heavy metals, Mn, Fe, Mg and Ca while no seasonal variations were observed for anthropogenic heavy metals, Cu, Cd, Cr, Pb and Ni. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that there was strong correlation between geogenic and anthropogenic heavy metals in water and sediment, both originating from the common anthropogenic sources. Accumulation of most of the metals in all the tissues was above the safe limits as recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization. High bioaccumulation factors and metal pollution index for these metals in the different tissues revealed that metals were extensively bio-accumulated and bioconcentrated. Condition indices in fish from the wetland suggested metabolic abnormalities.

AB  - This study characterized the thermal environment and assessed the physiological aspects of acclimatization of Sindhi and Guzerat heifers in a tropical environment (Brazil) under shade. Eight Sindhi and eight Guzerat purebred heifers (Bos indicus) had their physiological traits measured twice a day (9: 00 a. m. and 2: 00 p.m.). Environmental data during the experimental period were collected at two-hour intervals between 5: 00 a. m. and 5: 00 p.m. The temperature-humidity (THI) and the black globe temperature-humidity (BGHI) indices were calculated, and surface temperature (S-t), respiratory rate (R-r), and rectal temperature (R-t) were collected, being used to estimate heat loss by cutaneous (E-c) and respiratory (E-r) evaporation. In the warmer parts of the day (1: 00 and 3: 00 p. m.), the THI and BGHI reached values of 80.26 and 81.25, respectively. There was no significant difference in rectal temperatures between the breeds, but higher values were observed in the afternoon. Heat transfer by cutaneous evaporation reached 118.71 +/- 12.91 W. m(-2) and 103.43 +/- 6.82 W. m(-2) at 2: 00 p. m. for the Sindhi and Guzerat heifers, respectively. Under these conditions (air temperature was between 29 and 30 degrees C), 84% of the total latent heat loss in Sindhi and Guzerat heifers was represented by E-c. It can be concluded that Sindhi and Guzerat heifers can maintain homeothermy with minimal thermoregulatory effort under shade conditions in a tropical environment.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of biostimulant treatment and chilling applied during the young phase of growth on stress indicators, antioxidant compounds and physiological status of coriander leaves. Coriander transplants were sprayed three times with Asahi SL or Goemar Goteo (Arysta Life Science). After the last spraying, 6-week-old plants were placed in vegetative chambers at 6 degrees C (chilling stress) and 18 degrees C (control) for 6days, and then stress biomarkers, total antioxidant activity, photosynthetic pigment concentration, chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthetic activity were determined in leaves. In chilled conditions, biostimulant application significantly decreased electrolyte leakage from leaf tissues to the level determined for non-chilled plants. The comparison of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde concentrations for control and biostimulant-treated plants did not confirm the protective effect of biostimulants against stress molecule accumulation in chilling conditions. Biostimulants increased maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem II, the rate of transpiration and stomatal conductance but decreased intercellular carbon dioxide concentration. L-ascorbic acid, total phenolic concentration and total antioxidant activity increased as a result of biostimulant application to chilled plants. The increased values of most photosynthesis and stress indicators in coriander leaves after 6days chilling showed that plants were in a phase of acclimation to low temperature. The results indicate that biostimulants can affect selected metabolic pathways, accelerating the adaptation of chilled coriander plants. The precise use of plant growth regulators with application of chilling can be a method for controlling nutritionally important compounds in coriander foliage.

AB  - Most studies characterize microbial source tracking (MST) target performance using sensitivity and specificity metrics. However, it is important to also consider the temporal stability of MST targets in relation to regulated microbial pollutants. Differences among bacterial target stabilities may lead to erroneous conclusions about sources of contamination. The present study evaluates the relative stability of MST targets and fecal indicator organisms using the gull/pigeon-associated Catellicoccus marimammalium (CAT) marker and enterococci (ENT). The decay rates of CAT and ENT measured by culture (cENT) and QPCR (tENT) were compared in sand and seawater laboratory microcosms under environmentally relevant conditions (subject to tidal wetting versus no wetting in sand, and sunlit versus dark conditions in seawater). Bacterial targets were more persistent in beach sand than in seawater with decay rates on the order of 0.01-0.1 per day and 1 to 10 per day, respectively. Targets were more persistent in unwetted compared to wetted sand, and dark compared to sunlit seawater. During the first 8 days of the sand experiment, the decay rate k of CAT was greater than that of cENT. The decay rates of CAT, tENT, and cENT were similar in sand after day 8 and in dark seawater. In sunlit seawater, the decay rates were different between targets with k(CENT) > k(CAT) > k(tENT). The decay rates presented here are useful for fate and transport models and also inform the use of MST marker concentrations to infer ENT sources in the environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With reference to building applications, recent scientific literature shows good potential in reducing cooling loads by means of phase change materials (PCMs), integrated in the building exterior envelope.
   This paper proposes a deepening, by investigating if these dynamic components could contribute in reducing building cooling demand in Mediterranean climates. An office building is analyzed, with reference to the entire cooling season (from May 1st to September 30th), in reliable conditions as regards building use, and thus internal gains, occupancy, activation of cooling systems.
   More in detail, through hourly energy simulation, the achievable cooling energy savings have been calculated, with reference to a well-insulated massive building, refurbished by means of addition of PCM plaster on the inner side of the exterior envelope. Five Mediterranean climates have been taken into account: Ankara (Turkey), Athens (Greece), Naples (Italy), Marseille (France), Seville (Spain). The studies regarded the influences of the phase change temperature, thickness of the PCM wallboard and location of the PCM layer.
   Beyond the evaluation of the absolute savings of primary energy requests for cooling, the energy saving rate and the not-overheating time have been calculated, respectively by considering an air conditioned building and a naturally ventilated building with free-running indoor temperatures.
   Starting from the achieved results, through the values of the proposed indicators, this paper would suggest information useful for proper design and selection of phase change materials for building applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowledge of the interplay of abiotic factors and the invasive success of exotic fish is fundamental both to proper management and the ability to predict consequences for native communities. The highly invasive eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) has been introduced worldwide; however, although salinity could limit its invasive success, the influence of variations in water salinity on its population biology has been scarcely studied. The present study aimed to analyse the effect of changes in water salinity on the life history and microhabitat use of a mosquitofish population inhabiting a hypersaline stream subjected to human-caused dilution stress. Dilution process and associated habitat changes, such as increased aquatic vegetation, available food and the spread of invasive riparian vegetation (the common reed Phragmites australis), seem to have favoured mosquitofish proliferation and colonization. Dilution caused an increased somatic condition for all individuals and a higher reproductive investment of males and larger females. This led to greater survival, recruitment rates, and abundance during the period of lower salinity. The species showed changes in microhabitat use which could be advantageous in less saline conditions; for instance, the species preferentially used areas with the presence of P. australis as a refuge, and this pattern increased during the dilution period. These results support the hypothesis that human activity is one of the main forces shaping the colonization and proliferation of exotic freshwater fishes. At least in a Mediterranean context, an increase in mosquitofish abundance and the improvement of its population status could be clear indicators of the degradation of natural saline systems.

AB  - Despite well-documented negative impacts of invasive species on native biota, evidence for the facilitation of native organisms, particularly by habitat-forming invasive species, is increasing. However, most of these studies are conducted at the population or community level, and we know little about the individual fitness consequences of recruitment to habitat-forming invasive species and, consequently, whether recruitment to these habitats is adaptive. We determined the consequences of recruitment to the invasive green alga Caulerpa taxifolia on the native soft-sediment bivalve Anadara trapezia and nearby unvegetated sediment. Initially, we documented the growth and survivorship of A. trapezia following a natural recruitment event, to which recruitment to C. taxifolia was very high. After 12 months, few clams remained in either habitat, and those that remained showed little growth. Experimental manipulations of recruits demonstrated that all performance measures (survivorship, growth and condition) were significantly reduced in C. taxifolia sediments compared to unvegetated sediments. Exploration of potential mechanisms responsible for the reduced performance in C. taxifolia sediments showed that water flow and water column dissolved oxygen (DO) were significantly reduced under the canopy of C. taxifolia and that sediment anoxia was significantly higher and sediment sulphides greater in C. taxifolia sediments. However, phytoplankton abundance (an indicator of food supply) was significantly higher in C. taxifolia sediments than in unvegetated ones. Our results demonstrate that recruitment of native species to habitat-forming invasive species can reduce growth, condition and survivorship and that studies conducted at the community level may lead to erroneous conclusions about the impacts of invaders and should include studies on life-history traits, particularly juveniles.

AB  - 1. Maps of averaged plant indicator values can supply spatially explicit information about environmental gradients and are therefore tools of broad relevance in applied ecology. However, field-based mapping demands extensive sampling and thus most assessments are at the level of plots rather than covering a whole area. To address these limitations, this study evaluated the potential of remote sensing to produce Ellenberg indicator maps.
   2. Ellenberg indicator values for water supply, soil pH and soil fertility were derived using species data from vegetation plots in montane rangeland. The extrapolation of these data was accomplished by partial least-squares (PLS) regression between indicator values and plot reflectance values extracted from airborne 'hyperspectral' imagery. Applying the regression to the imagery resulted in three largely accurate maps giving the spatial distribution of certain soil attributes as indicated by Ellenberg values (R-2 = 0.58-0.68 in cross-validation).
   3. Synthesis and applications. Mean indicator values express floristic composition as a single, comparable, continuous and mappable variable. This makes them an appealing tool for vegetation monitoring. Imaging spectroscopy provides fast access to spatially contiguous and explicit information about soil conditions as indicated by plants. The technique allows the investigation to advance beyond plots and supplies indicator maps at a stand-level resolution. The mapped gradients of environmental attributes are of direct relevance to plant growth. The maps depict life-span growth conditions rather than 'snap-shots' given by measurements that are often limited in space and time, cost intensive and difficult to implement.

AB  - The relationship between delta(18)O and delta(13)C in a closed-basin lake is a function of hydrological change, vapor exchange, lake productivity, and total CO2 (or carbonate alkalinity) concentration. Covariance of delta(18)O and delta(13)C usually occurs in lake sediments under the condition of hydrological closure for time periods of the order of 5000 yr or longer. On shorter time scales, however, certain subtleties in the use of the delta(13)C-delta(18)O covariance as a hydrology history indicator must be recognized. The covariant trend may not be found in hyper-alkaline lakes because of the insensitivity of delta(13)C to lake volume changes. For less alkaline closed-basin lakes, covariance of delta(13)C-delta(18)O Will result from relatively rapid increase or decrease of lake volume, with the rapid-decrease condition giving rise to heavy and narrow-ranged isotopic values for both delta(13)C and delta(18)O due to the coupled evaporation-productivity effect. When the lake volume remains stable (as is the case for an over-flowing open lake), poor delta(13)C-delta(18)O covariance will ensue, due to the effect of vapor exchange with the atmosphere.
   We have used the measured delta(13)C-delta(18)O covariance in carbonate sediments of Mono Lake, California, to deduce paleo-hydrological and lake-water alkalinity (and salinity) variations and found the results in consonance with Holocene lake-level history derived from the delta(18)O and other information.

AB  - Why are some people more susceptible to interference from previous emotional stimuli? Neural mechanisms underlying emotion regulation are typically studied with one-off positive or negative stimuli. Less is known about how they operate during dynamic emotional experiences, which more closely resemble how emotions occur in real life. Therefore, we investigated the interaction among temporal context, stimulus content, and regulatory strategy. Image sequences included either neutral to negative emotion or negative to neutral emotion. Participants were instructed to either passively watch the emotional stimuli or apply cognitive reappraisal during the image sequences presentation. Participants also reported their habitual use of cognitive reappraisal in their daily lives on a standard scale. We measured functional connectivity (FC) with electroencephalography (EEG) source localization. A three-way interaction suggested that, in addition to momentary emotional content and regulatory effort, the temporal context of stimuli impacts the FC between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in both alpha and beta frequency bands. In the reappraisal condition-but not the passive watch conditions-, individual differences in habitual reappraisal were manifested in the FC of vmPFC-ACC in alpha band. Emotion transitions may be more demanding because prefrontal-posterior FC in the beta band decreased during emotion transitions regardless of emotional content or regulation efforts. Flexible emotion regulation enables the recruiting of neural activities in response to the content of dynamic, ever-changing experiences encountered in daily life. Studying brain responses to dynamic emotional stimuli may shed light on individual differences in adaptation and psychological health. It also provides a more ecologically valid assessment of emotion regulation.

AB  - Introduction: The associations of anxiety and depression with metabolic syndrome (MetS) are not consistent across studies. Anxiety and depression are highly correlated and traditional methods don?t take the structure of this correlation into account. Our aim is to disentangle the relationship of these emotional conditions with MetS, using bifactor models, modelling both general and specific aspects between anxiety and depression. Methods: Bifactor models were tested using the baseline data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (n = 13,584). Anxiety and depression were accessed with the Clinical Interview Schedule - Revised. MetS was measured through assessment of its continuous components. Results: A bifactor S-1 model better represent the 14 CIS-R indicators, composed by an internalizing factor corresponding to depressive symptoms, anxiety, worry and the shared variance of all remaining CIS-R indicators, and also by residual variance explained by a somatic (e.g., fatigue and pain) and fear (e.g., panic and phobias) specific factors. Internalizing spectrum (13 = 0.116; p < 0.001) and the fear specific factor (13 = 0.060; p = 0.008) were associated with MetS after adjusting for confounders, whereas somatic specific factor was unlikely to be associated with MetS (13 = 0.002; p = 0.934). Conclusions: Anxiety and depression indicators were associated with MetS via a shared internalizing factor and also by a residual fear factor, but not by somatic residual factor. This finding has potential implications about shared biological and behavioral mechanisms that may link emotional conditions with MetS in adults.

AB  - Ten research plots were selected on the Eagle Mts. (Orlicke hory, Czech Republic) ridge, within complexes of young Norway spruce stands. Since 2002 the defoliation of tree crowns and height increment have been assessed every year after the vegetation season. Sampling of needles for nutrient analyses has been carried out since 2004 every autumn together with the crown condition assessment. Soil samples were taken in 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018. Samples of the upper organic layer and of the mineral soil in 0-25 cm depth were taken separately. Samples of assimilation organs, humus and mineral soil were prepared and analysed according to the standard ICP Forests methods. Long term results have confirmed that the crown defoliation is decreasing. Health status significantly improved, and crown defoliation values got comparable to those of other forest regions in the Czech Republic. Foliar concentrations of stress elements (sulfur, fluorine) decreased, and foliar analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in air pollution load. There is a problem with insufficient uptake of phosphorus. Soil analyses confirmed the fact that the soil environment is acidic, and the amounts of accessible phosphorus, exchangeable magnesium and calcium are significantly deficient in the mineral soil. In this region there is still high deposition load total N deposition varies usually between 30-40 kg.ha(-1).y(-1) and total S deposition between 15-30 kg.ha(-1).y(-1), i.e. 2-3 times higher than in other regions of the country.

AB  - Holocene climatic and environmental changes on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) have been widely discussed based on the climatic records from sedimentary cores. However, differences in the reconstructed climatic history from various studies in this region still exist, probably due to influence of climatic proxies from multiple factors and the chronological uncertainties in lacustrine sediments. Here we present records of terrestrial plant delta C-13, soil color and total organic carbon content over the past 8400 years from a well-dated meadow section on the northeastern TP. The terrestrial plant delta C-13 value serves as a good summer precipitation/moisture indicator in the studied region. Soil color property and TOC content are also able to disentangle the moisture evolution history. All the data show much wet climates at 8400-7400 cal yr BP, dry climates at 7400-6000 cal yr BP and then wet conditions with fluctuation at 6000-3200 cal yr BP. Late Holocene moisture appears to be comparable with moist conditions from 6000 to 3200 cal yr BP. By further comparing the climatic variations in the Lake Qinghai area with records of the reconstructed summer temperature and the Asian Monsoon precipitation, we believe that the pattern of moisture/precipitation evolution in the Lake Qinghai area was not completely consistent with regions around Lake Qinghai, probably due to complicated interaction between the East Asian Summer Monsoon and the Indian Summer Monsoon.

AB  - The proposed Anthropocene epoch related to the control of geosistems by human activity is analyzed on the basis of environmental vs. anthropical conditions of soil development on agricultural terraces (known locally as lamabordos) at Mixteca Alta, Oaxaca, Mexico. The complex relationships between landscape development, changes in environmental conditions, and culturally-driven transformations constitute spatial and temporal indicators of landscape transformation at a regional level. These indicators formed of old soils easily recognizable and differentiated by their morphology, color, stratigraphic position, and age, are a result of cultural transformations controlled by human activities, linked to the use of resources, the land usage, demography and land use planning of their settlement.
   The older soils, chromic Cambisols (calcaric), were formed during late Pleistocene. During early Holocene an increase of erosional processes allow a poor soil development (calcic Fluvisol). The soils developed 7900 years BP show evidence of anthropic impact (e.g. concentration of carbon particles). Towards middle Holocene (approximately 5500 years BP), the landscape was thoroughly transformed as a consequence of lamabordos building and an increase of the agricultural activity; soils developed are easily recognized in the field and can be regarded as stratigraphic markers. Here we suggest that these soils allow us to link to a new epoch in the Mixteca defined as the Anthropocene. Soils of late Holocene, developed between 2000 and 500 years BP, contain a higher content of carbon fragments and evidence of an increase in the phases of alluvial accumulation, suggesting a more intensive cultural use by settlement groups of the region.

AB  - In the current human-influenced era, drought is initiated by natural and human drivers, and human activities are as integral to drought as meteorological factors. In large irrigated agricultural regions with high levels of human intervention, where the natural farmland soil moisture has usually been changed significantly by high-frequency irrigation, the actual severity of agricultural drought is distorted in traditional drought indices. In this work, an agricultural drought index that considering irrigation processes based on the Palmer drought severity index (IrrPDSI) was developed to interpret the real agricultural drought conditions in irrigated regions, with a case study in the Haihe River Basin in northeast China. The water balance model in the original PDSI was revised by an auto-irrigation threshold method combined with a local irrigation schedule. The auto-irrigation setting of the index was used by taking irrigation quotas during specific growth stages of specific crops (wheat-corn) into consideration. A series of weekly comparative analyses are as follows: (1) The soil moisture analyses showed that soil moisture values calculated by the modified water balance model were close to the real values; (2) The statistical analyses indicated that most of the stations in the study area based on IrrPDSI had nearly normal distributed values; (3) The time series and spatial analyses showed that the results of the IrrPDSI-reported dry-wet evaluation were more consistent with documented real conditions. All the results revealed that IrrPDSI performed well when used to assess agricultural drought. This work has direct significance for agricultural drought management in large irrigated areas heavily disturbed by human activity.

AB  - A remote sensing technique has been developed to detect physiological condition of phytoplankton using in situ and moderate imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Aqua data. The recurring massive mixed algal bloom of diatom and Noctiluca scintillans in the Northern Arabian Sea during winter-spring was used as test bed to study formation, growth and degradation of phytoplankton. The ratio of chlorophyll (chl) to particulate organic carbon (POC) was considered as an indicator of phytoplankton physiological condition and used for the approach development. Algal blooms represent the areas of new production, and therefore, knowledge of their degradation is important to the study microbial loop and export carbon flux. Relation of chl/POC ratio with bacterial abundance revealed Gaussian distribution. Bacteria were strongly correlated with POC, and hence, the latter which is available from satellite data could be used as a proxy for remote assessment of bacteria. Thresholds for active and degrading phytoplankton were determined using the ratio computed from the satellite data. The criteria were implemented on MODIS data to generate an image representing distribution of degrading algal bloom. Bacteria abundance data from two validation cruises during dinoflagellate and cyanobacteria bloom confirmed well match up of phytoplankton degradation information from the satellite. Comparison of environmental parameters during decay phase of dinoflagellate (N. scintillans bloom (winter) and Trichodesmium bloom (summer) revealed that degradation after active Trichodesmium bloom was more severe as compared to the N. scintillans. The present study also highlights the prediction capability of phytoplankton degradation using a time series of satellite retrieved chlorophyll/POC images.

AB  - Higher individual genetic quality has been hypothesized to be associated with the expression of conspicuous ornaments. However, the relationship between multicomponent sexual signals and heterozygosity is poorly understood. In this study, we examined whether different ornaments, including song (repertoire size and bout length) and plumage coloration (yellow breast and blue crown), reflect individual genetic diversity in male blue tits (Aves: Cyanistes caeruleus). We estimated genetic diversity using 26 microsatellite markers that were classified as putatively functional (12 loci) and neutral (14 loci). We found that yellow breast carotenoid chroma, blue crown brightness, bout length and body condition were positively associated with heterozygosity at functional loci, but not with genetic diversity estimated at all typed loci or the subset of neutral markers. The lack of strong single-locus effects and the presence of identity disequilibrium in our population suggest that the observed heterozygosity-phenotype associations are driven by loci widely distributed across the genome. The predominant role of putatively functional loci evidences that the expression of secondary sexual characters is more tightly reflected by heterozygosity at genomic regions containing coding genes that are being actively expressed, a fact that may make ornamental traits more reliable indicators of the genetic quality of individuals. Overall, this study shows that multiple secondary sexual characters reflect male genetic diversity and lends support to the good-genes-as-heterozygosity hypothesis.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015, 115, 362-375.

AB  - The application of the sterile insect technique to fruit flies involves the mass-production of the pest insects using an artificial diet, irradiation during a narrow time window at the late pupal or early imaginal stage to inhibit reproduction without affecting reproductive capacity, and then release into the target area where the sterile insects compete reproductively with their wild counterparts. The timing of irradiation is important to enable the release of males that are sterile but of good quality and exhibit an acceptable sexual performance. In this study, we examined the pupal development of 12 tephritid (Diptera: Tephritidae) species: Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann), A. ludens (Loew), A. obliqua (Macquart), A. serpentina (Wiedemann), Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillett), B. dorsalis (Hendel), B. invadens (Drew, Tsuruta & White), B. oleae (Rossi), B. philippinensis (Drew & Hancock), B. tryoni (Froggatt), B. zonata (Saunders) and Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann). The insects were reared at various temperatures, in the laboratory (15-28 degrees C) and under fluctuating natural conditions (20-35 degrees C). The gradual colour changes of the insect eyes during metamorphosis were observed and photographed, measuring the specific eye colour parameters of each species and matching them with the colour scale of the Munsell Soil Color Charts. The duration of pupal development and the time to emergence in Anastrepha species were longer than those in C. capitata and Bactrocera species at all the holding temperatures. The data obtained can be used by mass-rearing facilities to manage pupal holding conditions and as indicators for optimizing the timing of irradiation.

AB  - Processing of woody lignocellulosic biomass, under heating in combination with ionic liquids (ILs) was studied in order to obtain simple (fermentable) sugars. Due to the new environmental challenges, finding greener ways to produce platform chemicals and/or bio-fuels has become a popular research area. Various industrial, pilot or laboratory scale technologies for the depolymerization or fractionation of lignocellulosic polysaccharides to monomers are known. One of the new, interesting, methods is to utilize ILs in biomass pre-treatment procedures with an aim to bypass other pre-treatment methods. Furthermore, in order even to initiate studies whether ILs can contribute to catalytic depolymerization, there has to be a robust way to analyze the IL-treated lignocellulosics. This is a major issue since woody samples that contain any salts such as ILs can indeed be quite challenging from the analytic point of view. The applied capillary electrophoresis was found to be an excellent analytical method providing substantial improvements compared to the earlier used chromatographic methods. In this work it was demonstrated that application of ILs, at elevated temperatures, contributes to hydrolysis and depolymerization of lignocellulose. The effect is time and temperature dependent: in harsh conditions sugars degrade but too low processing temperatures or short treatment times result in no meaningful effect. The formation of the degradation products of the monosaccharides is a good indicator of the harshness of the applied chemical conditions. Evidently, furfural and 5-(hydroxymethyl) furfural formed in rather short treatment times. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Epiphytic bryophytes and lichens are an important component of the endangered forest biota in temperate forests, their diversity and composition patterns being regulated by tree, stand and landscape scale factors. The aim of this study is to improve ecological understanding of such factors in managed coniferous-deciduous mixed forests of Hungary in the context of forest management. In particular, this study investigate the effect of tree species composition, stand structure (tree size distribution, shrub layer and dead wood), microclimate (light, temperature and air humidity), landscape and historical factors on the stand level and tree level composition of epiphytic bryophytes and lichens. The relationships were explored by multivariate methods (redundancy analysis, canonical correspondence analysis and variation partitioning) and indicator species analysis. Tree species is among the most important driver of species composition in both organism groups. For bryophytes, the continuity of forest microclimate and the presence of shrub layer are also important, while lichen assemblages are influenced by light availability. Landscape and historical variables were less influential than stand scale factors. On the basis of our results, the main strategy of management focusing on epiphyte diversity conservation should include: (1) the maintenance of tree species diversity in mixed stands; (2) increasing the proportion of deciduous trees (mainly oaks and hornbeam); (3) the maintenance of large trees within the stands; (4) the presence of shrub and regeneration layer; (5) the creation of heterogeneous light conditions.

AB  - We aimed to examine outcomes, moderators and mediators of a preventive school-based mental health intervention implemented by paraprofessionals in a war-affected setting in northern Sri Lanka. A cluster randomized trial was employed. Subsequent to screening 1,370 children in randomly selected schools, 399 children were assigned to an intervention (n=199) or waitlist control condition (n=200). The intervention consisted of 15 manualized sessions over 5 weeks of cognitive behavioral techniques and creative expressive elements. Assessments took place before, 1 week after, and 3 months after the intervention. Primary outcomes included post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive, and anxiety symptoms. No main effects on primary outcomes were identified. A main effect in favor of intervention for conduct problems was observed. This effect was stronger for younger children. Furthermore, we found intervention benefits for specific subgroups. Stronger effects were found for boys with regard to PTSD and anxiety symptoms, and for younger children on pro-social behavior. Moreover, we found stronger intervention effects on PTSD, anxiety, and function impairment for children experiencing lower levels of current war-related stressors. Girls in the intervention condition showed smaller reductions on PTSD symptoms than waitlisted girls. We conclude that preventive school-based psychosocial interventions in volatile areas characterized by ongoing war-related stressors may effectively improve indicators of psychological wellbeing and posttraumatic stress-related symptoms in some children. However, they may undermine natural recovery for others. Further research is necessary to examine how gender, age and current war-related experiences contribute to differential intervention effects.

AB  - The aim of this study was to confirm Pseudomonas spp. as the specific spoilage organism (SSO) of chilled beef during aerobic storage and to establish a model to predict the shelf life of beef. Naturally contaminated beef was stored at 4 degrees C, and the spoilage limit of Pseudomonas organisms was determined by measuring several quality indicators during storage, including the number of Pseudomonas organisms, total number of bacteria, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN) values, L value color scale scores and sensory evaluation scores. The beef was then stored at 0, 4, 7, 10, 15 or 20 degrees C for varying amounts of time, and the number of Pseudomonas organisms were counted, allowing a corresponding growth model to be established. The results showed that the presence of Pseudomonas spp. was significantly correlated to each quality characteristic (p<0.01), demonstrating that Pseudomonas spp. are the SSO of chilled beef and that the spoilage limit was 10(8.20) cfu/g. The Baranyi and Roberts equation can predict the growth of Pseudomonas spp. in beef, and the R(2) value of each model was greater than 0.95. The square root model was used as follows, and the absolute values of the residuals were less than 0.05: mu(1/2)(max) = 0.15604 [T+(-0.08472)] (p<0.01), R(2) = 0.98, lambda(-1/2) = 0.0649+0.0242T (p<0.01, R(2) = 0.94). The model presented here describes the impact of different temperatures on the growth of Pseudomonas spp., thereby establishing a model for the prediction of the shelf life of beef stored between 0 to 20 degrees C.

AB  - Time of flag leaf senescence is an important determinant of yield under stress and optimal environments. A segregating population from a cross between drought sensitive genotype (Variant-1) and drought tolerant genotype (Veery), was made to identify molecular markers linked to flag leaf senescence gene in wheat under water-stressed conditions as indicator for drought tolerance. Thirty eight RAPD and twenty-five ISSR primers were tested for polymorphism among parental genotypes and F-2 population. The present study indicated that four RAPD and two ISSR markers linked to the flag leaf senescence gene in wheat. QTLs for flag leaf senescence were associated with RAPD markers (Pr11(230bp), Pr19(240bp), OPU06(340bp) and OPH13(450bp)) and explained 7.0%, 50.0%, 24.0% and 13.0% of the phenotypic variation, respectively. QTLs for flag leaf senescence were also associated with ISSR markers (M1(1100bp) and AD2(300bp).) and explained 25% and 34% of the phenotypic variation, respectively. The RAPD markers (Pr11(230bp), Pr19(240bp), OPU06(340bp) and OPH13(450bp)) have genetic distance of 15.6, 15.0, 13.2 and 17.4 cM from flag leaf senescence gene, respectively. The ISSR markers (M1(1100bp) and AD2(300bp)) also showed the genetic distance of 12.5 and 10.2 cM from flag leaf senescence gene, respectively. Therefore, these four RAPD and the two ISSR markers were linked to the QTL for the flag leaf senescence gene as indicator of drought tolerance. These markers can be used in wheat breeding programs, as a selection tool in early generations.

AB  - Using four exclosures, the impact of mouflon grazing and weather on plant communities of the phytosociological alliances Koelerio-Phleion phleoidis and Hyperico perforati-Scleranthion perennis occurring on shallow soils within a forest landscape was studied in the Krivoklatsko Biosphere Reserve (Czech Republic) during seven years. In the years 2004-2010, the vascular plant species composition was recorded annually on a total of eight fenced and eight control plots, each 2 m x 1 m in size. Treatment, time, and weather data were used as explanatory variables in ordination and correlation analyses. Cover values of different life forms and indicator values varied significantly in dependence on the weather conditions of the preceding five months; however, correlations varied according to the vegetation type and were rather rarely detected. The effect of fencing appeared important in all study plots; however, the temporal trends were significant only in half of them. We did not find a significant interaction between treatment and time in the total dataset. A successional change was detected in one fenced plot only; in all other cases, the species composition fluctuated a phenomenon that is not directly attributable to weather conditions. In the fenced plots, the herbaceous vegetation cover decreased, mainly due to litter accumulation and partly due to shrub encroachment. At least some parts of the valuable and species-rich habitats could be maintained under high game density, but some parts are endangered by eutrophication and game grazing. Nature conservation management should balance both mechanisms.

AB  - Despite intensive efforts and tightened guidelines for improvement of water quality over the last 2 decades, declines of fish populations have been reported for several rivers around the world. The present study forms part of a comprehensive weight-of-evidence approach, which aims to identify potential causes for the decline in fish catches observed in the Upper Danube River. The major focus of the present Study is the investigation of the health status of wild barbel Barbus barbus L. collected from 3 locations along the Danube River, which experienced different levels of contamination. Whereas the comparison of the condition factor (CF) of field fish with that of control fish revealed no differences, ultrastructural investigations indicated severe disturbance of hepatic cell metabolism in field fish from the more contaminated sites Rottenacker and Ehingen, compared to both control fish and field fish from the less contaminated site Riedlingen. The ultrastructural analysis provided information about reactions of e.g. the rough endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, and mitochondria, indicating an impaired health status of barbel at the sampling sites Rottenacker and Ehingen, Even though a straightforward cause-effect: relationship between sediment contamination and ultrastructural alterations could not be established, based on a meta-analysis and toxicity assays it. may be suggested that sediment-bound xenobiotics at least partly account for the hepatocellular changes. A relationship between impaired fish health status and the decline of fish catches along the Upper Danube River cannot be excluded.

AB  - Crop-livestock farms are complex systems, The interactions operating in such systems involve decisional, biophysical, structural, and environmental factors. Moreover, as farmers face a large range of management options, tools are needed to support their decision-making to enable them to reach production levels meeting their objectives and compatible with their human and physical resources, while controlling their effects on the environment. GAMEDE, a whole-dairy-farm model, has been developed to explore this complexity and to represent dynamically the effect of management decisions on biomass and nitrogen flows and on numerous sustainability indicators, such as milk and forage crop productivity, labour requirements, nitrogen balance, and nitrogen efficiency.
   This article describes the integration of six modules accounting for biophysical processes in a dairy farm (forage production; forage conditioning; herd demography; milk, excreta and animal biomass productions: grazing, quality of fertilisers; and nitrogen gaseous emissions) together with a decision system accounting for the farmer's strategy and technical operations. Most of the six biophysical modules incorporate mathematical models from the literature, but the decision system stems from our own original work.
   Six commercial farms with different structures, agro-climatic conditions and management strategies were used for validation. The model can explain the differences found in their sustainability indicators at the year scale. The intra-year variability of the main biomass stocks and flows is also well explained. This quantitative validation was completed by a qualitative validation from researcher, adviser and farmer points of view, including simulations of prospective scenarios. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this study changes in the locomotory behaviour of the freshwater cladoceran Daphnia magna STRAUS were used as sublethal indicators of toxic copper (Cu) stress. The behavioural responses were determined by a real time image analysis, using a video camera and a Pentium-PC equipped with a standard low cost frame grabber. For a sequence of 50 images per group, where 10 daphnids were moving simultaneously, the trajectories have been reconstructed in binary image sequences. As biological endpoints, we defined the average swimming velocity and the average duration of swimming activity and inactivity. The behavioural responses of the daphnids were analysed under normal conditions (without Cu stress) and after application of sublethal Cu stress of following concentrations (in mug l(-1) (ppb)): C-1 = 1, C-2 = 5, C-3 = 10, C-4 = 20, C-5 = 30. The test organisms were exposed to the Cu concentration for 24 h under static conditions. Already after 9 h of Cu-exposure a significant (*P < 0.05) decrease of the average swimming velocity could be observed at the group of the highest Cu concentration (30 ppb). After 13 h of Cu-contamination the swimming velocity was significantly (*P < 0.05) reduced at group of 20 ppb Cu-treatment and after 14 h a significant (*P < 0.05) decrease of the average swimming velocity could be measured at the group of 10 ppb Cu-treatment. No significant decrease of the swimming velocity could be observed in the I and 5 ppb Cu-treatment. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study reviews published information on the tactical management decisions needed to maximise economic grain yield in winter-dominant rainfall regions of the Mediterranean type. Tactical decisions are defined as those relating to the period from immediately before sowing to harvest. Tactical management is the principal means by which farmers respond to changing environmental and short-term economic conditions as the season progresses. The review considers published evidence that underpins these decisions and relates to cereal crops (wheat, barley and oats), pulse crops (field pea, faba bean, chickpea and narrow-leaved lupin) and canola.
   The criteria used to guide management decisions during the season involve soil and tissue tests for nutrients, knowledge of weed numbers and resistance status in the current and previous seasons, weather conditions that favour disease development, and knowledge of thresholds and biology of insect pests that may warrant control measures. All of these decisions can be related to the timing of the opening rains and the length of the growing season; the crop, pasture or weeds present in the previous two seasons; the presence of pest-and disease-bearing crop residues; and the type of tillage in use. Most of these indicators require further refinement through research across environments, soil types, crop types and production systems.
   The likely interactions between tactical or short-term management decisions, longer term or strategic decisions, and genetic factors are discussed. The prevalent use of chemicals in the management of biotic factors that can impact the crops is noted, as is progress towards various systems of 'integrated' management of these threats to crop production. Most tactical decisions in rainfed cropping systems appear to be supported by adequate evidence, although some decisions are still based on practical experience and observations.
   Application of tactical management practices together with strategic management and use of improved genotypes provides the possibility of achieving rainfall-limited potential grain yield at a regional scale. The papers reviewed have been selected partly on the basis that the experimental treatments achieved the estimated potential grain yield. Where the potential grain yields are not being achieved in commercial crops, it remains unclear whether this is due to inadequate adoption of existing information or inadequate research to identify and address the underlying causes. We highlight the need to devise a simple decision aid to assist farmers and their advisers to respond to the variable seasonal conditions evident since the turn of the Century.

AB  - The nursery function of coastal habitats is one of the most frequently mentioned and recognized ecosystem services in the valuation of coastal ecosystems. Despite its importance our understanding of the precise habitat parameters and mechanisms that make a habitat important as a nursery area is still limited for many species. The study aimed to establish the importance of different algae morphotypes in providing shelter and food for juvenile coastal fish during the main settlement peaks, in early spring and late summer, in littoral rocky reef systems in the Northwestern Mediterranean. The results of our study showed strong seasonal differences in algae cover, composition and height between the two sampling periods. Overall, during spring the algae were well developed, while in late summer, both density and height, of most algae decreased considerably. Equally, prey biomass, in form of suitable sized invertebrate fauna associated to the algae, decreased. Accordingly, the shelter and food for the fish settling in this habitat during late summer were less abundant, indicating a mismatch between the observed presence of juvenile fish and optimal habitat conditions. Differences in prey densities were detected between algae morphotypes, with structurally more complex algae, such as Cystoseira spp. and Halopteris spp. consistently containing more prey, independent of season, compared to simpler structured morphotypes such as Dictoytales. The study furthermore related juvenile fish density to habitats dominated by different algae morphotypes. Out of the three-study species (Diplodus vulgaris, Symphodus ocellatus, Coris julis) only S. ocellatus showed a significant association with an algae habitat. S. ocellatus related positively to habitats dominated by Dictoytales which provided the highest cover during late summer but had the lowest prey densities. A strong association of this species with Cystoseira, as reported by other studies, could not be confirmed. Cystoseira was abundant within the study area but in a state of dieback, showing loss and reduced height of foliage, typical for the time of year within the study area. It is therefore likely that algae-fish associations are context-dependent and that several algae species may fulfil similar functions. We also discovered that prey biomass did not appear to have an important effect on juvenile abundances. Nevertheless, the availability of prey may influence juvenile fish condition, growth performance and ultimately long-term survival. We therefore suggest that future studies on habitat quality should also include, besides abundance, indicators related to the condition and growth of juveniles.

AB  - Water from different sources generally contains different kinds of suspended particles, which introduces the challenge of how to control physical clogging during managed aquifer recharge (MAR). Suspended solid concentration (SS) and turbidity (NTU) are widely recognized as indicators of physical clogging potential. The aims of this study were to examine the degree of physical clogging caused by organic and inorganic suspended particles and elaborate the different mechanisms that controlled clogging under specific SS and NTU conditions.
   Column experiments were performed by continuous suspended particle injection through a saturated porous medium under stable physicochemical and hydrodynamic conditions. Three sets of transport tests were carried out. One test was conducted with chlorinated-secondary wastewater (CSW), which SS was 17.59 +/- 0.44 mg L-1 corresponding to 3.09 +/- 0.05 NTU. The other two tests were silica-particle wastewater (SPW) with the same SS (1.73 +/- 0.03 NTU) and the same NTU (29.21 +/- 0.57 mg L-1 SS) as the CSW, abbreviated to SPW-SS and SPW-NTU, respectively. The particle breakthrough curves (BTCs), spatial deposition profiles, and variations in hydraulic conductivity were measured. The transport model, DLVO theory, and O'Melia and Ali clogging model were applied to explain the mechanisms of physical clogging in different systems.
   The retention of inorganic particles was greater than that of organic particles; 56.02% of organic particles were retained in CSW, while 87.62 and 86.36% of inorganic particles were retained in SPW-SS and SPW-NTU, respectively. The distribution of organic particles was less uniform than that of inorganic particles. However, the variation of the relative hydraulic conductivity (K/K (0)) was more significant for organic particles than for inorganic particles, with decreased by just 1.80 +/- 0.64% in SPW-SS and 4.03 +/- 1.64% in SPW-NTU, but decreased by 85.86 +/- 1.22% in CSW. This study explained the results with the support of classical models and the DLVO theory. The physicochemical characteristics of suspended particles determined whether and how physical clogging occurred.
   Suspended particles with different properties follow different transport-deposition processes and have different tendencies to cause physical clogging. Especially for organic particles, clogging degree is quite noticeable. Our results imply that the same SS and NTU threshold values cannot be applied to different types of source water during recharge to prevent physical clogging, even in the same controlled environmental conditions. Physicochemical characteristics of suspended particles need to be considered when developing physical clogging indicators.

AB  - Peanut production in the southeastern United States is often limited due to low Ca availability. Gypsum and lime are common Ca supplements for peanut, but the indeterminate nature of peanut and variable solubility of these products adds uncertainty to timing of Ca amendments. Two sets of field trials were performed in southern Alabama from 2012 to 2014 under both irrigated and non-irrigated conditions using two runner-type peanut cultivars (Georgia-06G and Georgia Greener) to determine Ca uptake patterns and timing of amendments. Calcium uptake was evaluated by pod development stage with four soil Ca treatments: 560 and 1120 kg ha-1 gypsum applied at early bloom, 1120 kg ha-1 lime at planting, and an untreated control. Developmental stages were determined by the hull scrape method. The timing of gypsum and lime was evaluated using metrics of peanut yield, grade, germination, and seed Ca. Treatments included a single application of gypsum at planting and early bloom, split applications of gypsum at planting/early bloom and early/mid-bloom, lime at planting, lime at planting plus gypsum at early bloom, and an untreated control. Results suggested that peanut absorbed Ca throughout the entire growing season and that seed Ca concentration could be used as an indicator of earlyseason seed quality. Split applications of gypsum at early/mid-bloom tended to have a superior performance than a single application at planting or early bloom and split applications at planting/early bloom. Supplemental gypsum at early bloom combined with lime at planting further increased Ca availability under non-irrigated conditions relative to the lime-only treatment. This study provided helpful information for Ca nutrient management for peanut.

AB  - Selection and assessment of mining equipment used in open pit rock mines relies chiefly on estimates of overall exploitation cost. The rational arrangement of mining equipment and systems comprising loading machines, haul trucks and crushing plants should be preceded by a thorough analysis of technical and economic aspects, such as investment outlays and the costs of further exploitation, which largely determine the costs of mining operations and the deposit value. Additionally, the operational parameters of the mining equipment ought to be considered. In this study, a universal set of evaluation criteria has been developed, and an evaluation method has been applied for the selection of surface mining equipment and the processing system to be operated in specific mining conditions, defined by the user. The objective of this study is to develop and apply the new methodology of multi-criteria selection of open pit rock mining equipment based on multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) procedures, to enable the optimization of loading, handling and crushing processes. The methodology, underpinned by the principles of MCDM, provides the dedicated ranking procedures, including the ELECTRE III. The applied methodology allows the alternative options (variants) to be ranked accordingly. Ultimately, a more universal methodology is developed, applicable in other surface mines where geological and mining conditions are similar. It may prove particularly useful in selection and performance assessment of mining equipment and process line configurations in mining of low-quality rock deposits. Therefore, we undertook to develop universal criteria and applications for the selection and performance assessment of process machines for surface mines, taking into account environmental aspects as well as deposit quality.

AB  - An important component of the National Forest Soils Inventory (NFSI) is the investigation of inorganic and organic pollutants. Forests are able to filter out large quantities of these substances from the atmosphere and incorporate them into the soil for a long time. The aim of this study was the integrative evaluation of organic and inorganic pollutant concentrations in forest soils in the state of Brandenburg, Germany. With the help of principle component analysis, the pollutant concentrations can essentially be explained by three significant environmental components, which explain 76% of the total variance of all pollutants examined within the scope of the NFSI. The first component characterizes the extent of the atmospheric pollution caused by flue gases and fly ash from lignite combustion in the 1970s and 1980s and is mainly charged by the organic pollutants HCB and PAH, and the elements arsenic and chromium. This component shows positive relation to both spatially interpolated calcium-deposition data from the 1980s (as an indicator for the dust emission from coal combustion) and crown defoliation data of pine stands from the forest condition survey in the early 1990s. The depositions of zinc and cadmium from industrial sources, vehicle traffic and the use of fertilizers in agriculture mainly characterize the second principle component. The use of the pesticides DDT and lindane in the early 1980s and the associated pollutants input into the forest soils are expressed by the third component. In expanding the term archiving function of soils, the results illustrate their particular importance for the long-term archiving of anthropogenic inputs and the associated potential stress factors for forests.

AB  - The use of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a universal biomass indicator is built on the premise that ATP concentration tracks biomass rather than the physiological condition of cells. However, reportedly high variability in ATP in response to environmental conditions is the main reason the method has not found widespread application. To test possible sources of this variability, we used the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii as a model and manipulated its growth rate through nutrient limitation and through exposure to three different temperatures (15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 25 degrees C). We simplified the ATP protocol with hot-water or chemical extraction methods, modified a commercially available luciferin-luciferase assay, and employed single-photon counting in a scintillation counter, all of which increased sensitivity and throughput. Per-cell ATP levels remained relatively constant despite changes in growth rates by approximately 10-fold in the batch culture (i.e., nutrient limitation) experiments, and approximately 2-fold in response to temperature. The re-examination of related literature values revealed that average cellular ATP levels differed little among taxonomic groups of aquatic microbes, even at the domain level, and correlated well with bulk properties such as elemental carbon or nitrogen. Fulfilling multiple cellular functions in addition to being the universal energy currency requires ATP to be maintained in a millimolar concentration range. Consequently, ATP relates directly to live cytoplasm volume, while elemental carbon and nitrogen are constrained by an indeterminate pool of detrital material and intracellular storage compounds. The ATP-biomass indicator is sensitive, economical, and can be readily standardized among laboratories and across environments.

AB  - The photosynthetic rates of leaves depend on the vertical position and cultivation conditions. However, few models have been proposed to express photosynthesis according to leaf position, and there was a lack of quantitative analysis between physiological indicators and model parameters. The objectives of this study were to analyze the leaf photosynthetic characteristics of paprika plants according to leaf vertical position using photosynthesis models, and to analyze the relationship between the total nitrogen content and the photosynthetic model parameters. Leaf photosynthetic rates at different vertical positions were measured under varying light intensities and CO2 concentrations in triplicate. Rectangular hyperbola and FvCB (Farquhar, von Caemmerer, and Berry) models were selected, calibrated, and validated as multivariable photosynthesis models. Total nitrogen contents and SPAD values were measured at each leaf position and the coefficients of the photosynthetic rate models were compared. The R-2 values for the rectangular hyperbola and FvCB models were 0.86 and 0.91, and the RMSE values were 4.651 and 2.104, respectively. Total nitrogen content linearly increased with increasing vertical leaf position and it was linearly related to the maximum carboxylation capacity and maximum electron transport rate, estimated in the FvCB model. In this study, the FvCB model was considered more suitable for expressing the relationship between total nitrogen contents and plant's physiological responses according to the vertical position of leaves. The vertical leaf photosynthetic rate models established in this study will contribute to determining optimal environmental conditions for maximizing crop photosynthesis and establish the criteria for precise CO2 enrichment in greenhouses.

AB  - Pollution of rivers and streams, by anthropic action, is characterized as an environmental, social, and sanitary problem. Factors such as the association between the marginal vegetation, the distribution of the substrates in the riverbed, and the availability of allochthonous organic matter influence the distribution and composition of the aquatic entomofauna. The objective of this study was to analyze the structure of aquatic insect communities in a pasture stream in northern Parana, southern Brazil, with emphasis on the groups of indicators of good water quality, thus inferring the conditions of its preservation. Samples were collected from July to October in three parts of the stream (P1, P2, and P3), where the insect faune was collected with the aid of a sieve in the foliage substrate and washing of rocks and decomposing pieces of wood. A total of 1323 individuals were collected, being Chironomidae (Diptera) the most abundant taxon. The analysis of the biotic indices (EPT/Chironomidae, IBF, BMWP, and BMWP/ASPT) and diversity indicated better preservation conditions at points P1 and P3 where the riparian forest was well preserved, with less exposure to the stream bed. In P2, the entomofauna presented less diversity and the biotic indexes indicated loss of water quality, showing the impacts of changes in the marginal vegetation of this section. In a generally preserved aquatic environment, small changes in its vegetation are sufficient to cause an imbalance in the aquatic insect community, showing the efficiency of these organisms as bio-indicators and the sensitivity of biotic indexes.

AB  - Investigations of glacial sediment exposures in a former open pit in the Pine Point Mining District, Northwest Territories, reveal evidence of changes in stress magnitude as exhibited by the movement of deformation 'fronts' within subglacial tills, as evident through micromorphological analysis. Indications of deformation, driven by stress fluctuations, were observed throughout a set of vertical subglacial till samples associated with the Laurentide Ice Sheet. These tills exhibit multiple sub-lithofacies variations in concert with marked changes in microshear orientation, which can be directly related to changing stress levels within a subglacial deforming bed. The evidence of changes in till stress conditions is typical of subglacial tills occurring beneath an active temperate ice mass within a soft deforming bed. As differing 'layers' of till that form a mosaic-like pattern become immobilized and 'detached' subjacent to the deforming bed sediments, a signature of this action is recorded within the tills as sequences of specific microstructures. These microstructures are part of a spectrum of micro-forms that develop as consequence of changes in stress, porewater content and clay content within the 'fault-gouge'-like environment formed beneath an active temperate ice sheet. A model is developed that uses data from Pit O-28 demonstrating where deformation 'boundary front' evidence in the form of deformation bands has developed as basal driven stress levels have penetrated active deforming sediments. The evidence from Pine Point indicates that till acts as an excellent palaeo-strain record of past active glacial processes, subglacial basal thermal conditions and sediment mobility.

AB  - Heavy-ion beams have been widely utilized as a novel and effective mutagen for mutation breeding in diverse plant species, but the induced mutation spectrum is not fully understood at the genome scale. We describe the development of a multiplexed and cost-efficient whole-exome sequencing procedure in rice, and its application to characterize an unselected population of heavy-ion beam-induced mutations. The bioinformatics pipeline identified single-nucleotide mutations as well as small and large (>63 kb) insertions and deletions, and showed good agreement with the results obtained with conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analyses. We applied the procedure to analyze the mutation spectrum induced by heavy-ion beams at the population level. In total, 165 individual M-2 lines derived from six irradiation conditions as well as eight pools from non-irradiated 'Nipponbare' controls were sequenced using the newly established target exome sequencing procedure. The characteristics and distribution of carbon-ion beam-induced mutations were analyzed in the absence of bias introduced by visual mutant selections. The average (+/- SE) number of mutations within the target exon regions was 9.06 +/- 0.37 induced by 150 Gy irradiation of dry seeds. The mutation frequency changed in parallel to the irradiation dose when dry seeds were irradiated. The total number of mutations detected by sequencing unselected M-2 lines was correlated with the conventional mutation frequency determined by the occurrence of morphological mutants. Therefore, mutation frequency may be a good indicator for sequencing-based determination of the optimal irradiation condition for induction of mutations.

AB  - Light pollution or artificial light at night (ALAN) is increasingly recognised to be an important anthropogenic environmental pressure on wildlife, affecting animal behaviour and physiology. Early life experiences are extremely important for the development, physiological status and health of organisms, and as such, early exposure to artificial light may have detrimental consequences for organism fitness. We experimentally manipulated the light environment of free-living great tit nestlings (Parus major), an important model species in evolutionary and environmental research. Haptoglobin (Hp) and nitric oxide (NOx), as important indicators of immunity, health, and physiological condition, were quantified in nestlings at baseline (13 days after hatching) and after a two night exposure to ALAN. We found that ALAN increased Hp and decreased NOx. ALAN may increase stress and oxidative stress and reduce melatonin which could subsequently lead to increased Hp and decreased NOx. Haptoglobin is part of the immune response and mounting an immune response is costly in energy and resources and, trade-offs are likely to occur with other energetically demanding tasks, such as survival or reproduction. Acute inhibition of NOx may have a cascading effect as it also affects other physiological aspects and may negatively affect immunocompetence. The consequences of the observed effects on Hp and NOx remain to be examined. Our study provides experimental field evidence that ALAN affects nestlings' physiology during development and early life exposure to ALAN could therefore have long lasting effects throughout adulthood.

AB  - In order to gain more knowledge regarding the microbial community and its influence on carbon sequestration in subsoil, two depth profiles with different natural soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations were sampled. This makes it possible to investigate the extent to which natural SOC availability or other subsoil specific conditions influence the composition and the functional diversity of the microbial community and in return how the microbial community composition affects SOC sequestration under these conditions. Soil samples were taken at four different depths on two neighbouring arable sites; one Colluvic Cambisol with high SOC concentrations (8-12 g kg(-1)) throughout the profile and one Haplic Luvisol with low SOC concentrations (3-4 g kg(-1)) below 30 cm depth. Multi-substrate-induced-respiration (MSIR) was used to identify shifts in functional diversity of the microbial community along the profiles. The amino sugars muramic acid and glucosamine were measured as indicators for bacterial and fungal residues and ergosterol was determined as a marker for saprotrophic fungi. Discriminant analysis of respiration values obtained from the 17 substrates used in the MSIR revealed that substrate use in subsoil differed significantly from that in topsoil and also differed highly between the two subsoils. Amino sugar analysis and the ratio of ergosterol to microbial biomass C showed that fungal dominance decreased with depth. MSIR clearly demonstrated that not only the fungi to bacteria ratio but also substrate use of the microbial community changed with depth according to substrate availability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Hudson Bay Lowlands (HBL) is the largest peatland complex in North America. More than 75% of the HBL occurs in Ontario, where the provincial government mandates that ecosystem carbon storage and sequestration be considered in land-use planning. Accomplishing this task requires identifying carbon indicators and assessing their responses to changing ecosystem processes, such as succession, permafrost thaw, and evapotranspiration (ET). Therefore, we synthesized information on peat carbon indicators and ecosystem process from the literature. Findings indicate that the long-term carbon accumulation, carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration, peat depth, and peatland age were similar (p > 0.10) between dry and wet peatland features. Furthermore, CO2 sequestration displayed the highest variability and ponds were net CO2 emitters. Recent carbon accumulation, CH4 emission, and ET were highest (p < 0.01) in wet features, with CH4 emission displaying wide variation. Increased active layer thickness (105 +/- 92 cm per 100 years) in permafrost was the most variable ecosystem process analyzed in this study, while variation in permafrost loss (53 +/- 23% per 100 years) was similar to that of carbon accumulation and ET rates. Processes creating wet and pond conditions may increase landscape-scale CO2 and CH4 emissions to the atmosphere, weakening peatland carbon sinks. Dry conditions may reduce CH4 emissions but potentially increase peatland susceptibility to fire. Knowledge of these changes should be useful for climate change vulnerability and adaptation assessments for large landscapes. However, better understanding of variability in CO2 sequestration, CH4 emission, and permafrost dynamics is required to design such assessments for small landscapes.

AB  - Colony morphology may be an indicator of phenotypic variation, this being an important adaptive process adopted by bacteria to overcome environmental stressors. Furthermore, alterations in colony traits may reflect increased virulence and antimicrobial resistance. Despite the potential relevance of using colony morphological traits, the influence of experimental conditions on colony morphogenesis has been scarcely studied in detail. This study aims to clearly and systematically demonstrate the impact of some variables, such as colony growth time, plate colony density, culture medium, planktonic or biofilm mode of growth and strain genetic background, on bacterial colony morphology features using two Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Results, based on 5-replicate experiments, demonstrated that all variables influenced colony morphogenesis and 18 different morphotypes were identified, showing different sizes, forms, colours, textures and margins. Colony growth time and composition of the medium were the variables that caused the highest impact on colony differentiation both derived from planktonic and biofilm cultures. Colony morphology characterization before 45 h of incubation was considered inadequate and TSA, a non-selective medium, provided more colony diversity in contrast to P. aeruginosa selective media. In conclusion, data obtained emphasized the need to perform comparisons between colony morphologies in equivalent experimental conditions to avoid misinterpretation of microbial diagnostics and biomedical studies. Since colony morphotyping showed to be a reliable method to evaluate phenotypic switching and also to infer about bacterial diversity in biofilms, these unambiguous comparisons between morphotypes may offer a quite valuable input to clinical diagnosis, aiding the decision-making towards the selection of the most suitable antibiotic and supportive treatments.

AB  - We have investigated the variability of the magnetic properties of surface sediments across eight Minnesota lake basins. The measured magnetic properties are controlled by the competing fluxes of allochthonous and autochthonous magnetic particles, and differ according to location in the basin. Shoreline sediments are dominated by detrital magnetic particles, whereas littoral and profundal sediments are characterized by a combination of bacterial magnetosomes and detrital particles. The position of the oxic-anoxic interface, which may occur in the water or within the sediment column, controls the depth at which living magnetotactic bacteria occur, and determines the degree of preservation of their magnetosome chains in the surface sediment. The preservation potential of undisturbed chains is higher for bacterial magnetite formed at the top of the sediment column in the littoral area than for magnetosomes originating in the water column in the profundal area. Bacterial magnetite in the profundal facies will contain a higher proportion of chains collapsed during settlement through the water column to the lake bottom. This process increases the fraction of interacting magnetosomes, which in turn artificially lowers the ARM ratio (chi(ARM)/IRM), which ceases to be a reliable grain size indicator in the profundal environment. Our results indicate that a holistic approach to interpreting limnologically-derived paleoecological data should be employed. Specifically, a thorough understanding of evolving and interrelated factors such as basin morphology and limnologic conditions is crucial for a more confident interpretation of the sedimentary record in terms of environmental conditions at the time of sediment deposition.

AB  - This study assessed air quality indicators before and after enactment of the Spanish anti-smoking law. Mass and number concentrations and the chemical composition of particles were evaluated. Microscopy analyses were also conducted. Real time. concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, PM1 and ultrafine particles were measured under ventilated and non-ventilated conditions and PM10 samples were collected for detailed inorganic and organic chemical characterization. Before enactment of the law in 2010, tobacco smoke produced significant indoor ambient particulate matter pollution, with elevated particulate matter mass concentrations (PM10 and PM1 concentrations of 122-220 and 48-85 mu g/m(3), respectively) and ultrafine particle numbers (75,000 and 48,000 cm(-3) under ventilated and non-ventilated conditions, respectively). Typical tobacco smoke tracers including iso- and anteiso-alkanes and elements including La and Ce from the ignition of lighters were abundant. Additionally, several toxic substances derived from tobacco smoke, including Cd (3.1 ng/m(3)) and benzo[a]pyrene (1.0 ng/m(3)) were present at concentrations approximately 10 times greater than those measured after enactment of the anti-smoking law.

AB  - The Angera stone is a sedimentary Triassic dolostone mainly composed of dolomite, which was widely employed in the Lombard architecture. In the present work, the study of the Angera stone of the 'Cortile del Richini', a masterpiece of the Lombard baroque, is discussed as an example of a particularly challenging conservation issue. The courtyard suffered from a particularly troubled conservative history and the highly polluted urban environment of Milan provided very favourable conditions for the decay of such a delicate stone type. The last extensive conservative intervention was performed during the nineties due to massive black crust formation and granular disintegration of the stone. Almost 20 years later, a thorough study of the stone has been aimed at the definition of a long-term maintenance project. The Angera stone has been investigated in order to define an updated version of its state of conservation, as well as to track any changes in the degradation mechanisms due to the environmental variations of the Milan city centre. In particular, the soluble salts' content of the stone substrate has been evaluated as an indicator of the damage level. The results highlighted that the stone is currently in critical condition: An extensive sulphation process is taking place, leading to the chemical transformation of the dolomitic substrate into gypsum. Moreover, the powder deposits affecting the stone surfaces have a similar composition to those generally found in the black crusts growing in urban environment. Therefore, they can be considered as precursor of this particularly dangerous decay mechanism.

AB  - This paper revisits various hypotheses about oligarchic patterns in Amazonian tree communities put forward by Pitman et al. (2001). Together, these hypotheses predict that most lowland sites in the Amazon are located within large patches of relatively homogeneous edaphic and other environmental conditions, where an oligarchy of common, frequent tree species accounts for a majority of trees. To assess the degree to which these hypotheses have been corroborated or refuted over the last ten years, we reviewed > 200 studies published since 2001. We found overwhelming support for the hypo thesis that large-scale oligarchies of common and frequent species are a common feature of Amazonian tree communities. At least 22 studies have documented oligarchies in Amazonian woody plant communities to date, and no studies have looked for oligarchies as defined by Pitman et al. (2001) and failed to find them. We argue that six publications that offer critiques of the oligarchy hypothesis do not constitute valid tests. The other hypotheses in Pitman et al. (2001) one regarding the specific oligarchic taxa that dominate forests near the eastern base of the Andes and one that attempts to explain why oligarchic species exist are less well supported by the literature, in large part because they have not been subjected to many tests. We discuss links between these hypotheses and other well-known patterns and hypotheses in ecology (the abundanceoccupancy relationship, the JanzenConnell hypothesis, the niche-environment hypothesis, and the niche breadth hypothesis), and provide additional detail to facilitate rigorous tests in the future. The paper concludes by presenting remote sensing evidence that large patches of relatively homogeneous environmental conditions account for most of the upland forest landscape across Amazonian Peru.

AB  - Rotifera density, biomass, and secondary production on two marginal lakes of Paranapanema River were compared after the recovery of hydrologic connectivity with the river (Sao Paulo State, Brazil). Daily samplings were performed in limnetic zone of both lakes during the rainy season immediately after lateral inflow of water and, in the dry period, six months after hydrologic connectivity recovery. In order to identify the factors that affect rotifer population dynamics, lake water level, volume, depth, temperature, transparency, dissolved oxygen, pH, alkalinity, conductivity, suspended solids, nutrients, and chlorophyll-a were determined. Variations of water physical and chemical factors that affect rotifer population were related to the lake-river degree of connection and to water level rising after drought. The water lateral inflow from the river resulted in an increase in lake water volume, depth, and transparency and a decrease in water pH, alkalinity, and suspended solids. The lake with the wider river connection, more frequent biota exchange, and larger amount of particulate and dissolved materials was richer and more diverse, while rotifer density, biomass, and productivity were lower in both periods studied. Density, biomass, and secondary production were higher in the lake with the smaller river connection and the higher physical and chemical stability. Our results show that the connectivity affects the limnological stability, associated to seasonality. Stable conditions, caused by low connectivity in dry periods, were related with high density, biomass and secondary production. Conversely, instability conditions in rainy periods were associated to elevated richness and diversity values, caused by exchange biota due to higher connectivity. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms that control vegetation development beneath canopy gaps is of major importance for a nature-based management of European beech forests. We studied the herb layer vegetation beneath 56 canopy gaps of various sizes (116-1410m(2)) in near-natural beech forest stands of the Kellerwald-Edersee National Park, Germany. Three objectives were pursued: (i) to compare the patterns of species number and species composition caused by different gap sizes and light conditions with those found in North America, (ii) to investigate the impact of herbivory by ungulates on gap vegetation and (iii) to assess establishment from a persistent seed bank and zoochorous seed dispersal as potential pathways for gap colonisation. Herbivory intensity was determined for each gap as the proportion of browsed terminal shoots of beech saplings. The mean Ellenberg indicator value for light was used as a measure for light availability in gaps. The data were analysed by a variation partitioning approach using multiple regression and redundancy analysis.
   Species number increased with gap size and light availability. Herbivory caused a reduction of competition by tree regeneration and was therefore responsible for higher species numbers, too. Species composition was relatively homogenous but significantly determined by gap size, light availability and herbivory. With more favourable light conditions, an increasing proportion of generalist species occurred within gaps. By means of two dispersal traits, it is shown that these species may use both pathways, a persistent seed bank or transportation by ungulates, to colonise gaps. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A study was conducted in a marine inlet to assess the effects of untreated discharges from a pulp and paper mill, a municipality, and industries in western Newfoundland on winter flounder ( Pleuronectes americanus), a fish species shown previously to be sensitive to environmental contaminants in sediment. The fish were captured by SCUBA divers about 2 km down-current from the mill discharging effluent containing resin acids, and at three reference sites 2 to 11 km away near the opposite shore, each spring in five consecutive years and the fish were necropsied on site. A total of 360 and 339 flounder were examined near the mill and references sites, respectively. Several bioindicators were used to assess fish health including parasites. More fish exhibiting external and microscopic lesions in several tissues, lower condition factors, elevated hepatosomatic index, and delayed reproductive development were observed in samples taken near the paper mill than at the reference sites. A higher prevalence of an ectoparasite, Cryptocotyle lingua, but a significantly lower mean abundance of three metazoans infecting the digestive tract was noted in fish near the mill than in the reference samples. These results, comprising abnormal fish size distribution, low body condition factor, external and internal lesions, enlarged liver, delayed gonadal development, and changes in parasitism, were stress-related, indicative of impaired health, and associated primarily with untreated discharges from the pulp and paper mill. This integrated and multidisciplinary study also provides further evidence on the use of fish parasites as a valid and an additional bioindicator in programs monitoring environmental contaminants.

AB  - Previous studies have revealed that microdiamonds from the Kokchetav ultra-high pressure metamorphic terrane of Kazakhstan contain nanometric scale inclusions of Si-, Fe-, Ti-, and Cr-oxides. Because the structure Of SiO2 inclusions was not confirmed to be coesite or stishovite due to their very small size, such diamonds formerly served only as an indicator of a minimum pressure, ca. 4 GPa. Geothermobarometry applied to Kokchetav diamond-bearing rocks yielded a wide range of conditions: T=700 degrees C-1250 degrees C, and P=4-9 GPa. Our paper presents transmission electron microscopy studies with focused ion beam assistance that indicate that diamonds from marbles contain inclusions of aragonite (CaCO3) and magnesite (MgCO3) and that aragonite and nitrogen-bearing nanometric particles are associated with dislocations reflecting diamond growth at relatively high-temperature conditions. We determined the boundary of dolomite stability using the reaction CaMg(CO3)(2) (dolomite)= CaCO3 (aragonite)+ MgCO3. This allowed us to utilize available experimental data to evaluate the pressure at which diamond was crystallized. Taking into consideration uncertainties existing between experimental data produced in different laboratories, we propose the pressure for Kokehetav diamond crystallization to be similar to 6 to 9 GPa. This evaluation is based on the assumption that temperature was determined correctly as 980 degrees C (minimum) and 1250 degrees C (maximum) for diamond-grade dolomitic marbles. Our data provide strong evidence that the metasedimentary rocks of the Kokcbetav massif containing diamonds were subducted to the depth of similar to 190-280 km. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Inter-individual variation in levels of sex hormones results from differences in genetic, developmental, and environmental factors. We tested a hypothesis that programming of the fetal neuroendocrine axis may predispose some women to produce higher levels of steroid hormones during their menstrual cycles as adults. One hundred forty-five regularly menstruating 24- to 36-year-old women collected daily saliva samples for one menstrual cycle. Data on women's birth weights and birth lengths were obtained from medical records. A positive relationship was observed between ponderal index at birth (an indicator of nutritional status, calculated as birth weight/(birth length)(3)) and levels of estradiol (E2) in menstrual cycles, after controlling for potential confounding factors. Mean E2 was 16.4 pmol/l in the low ponderal index tertile, 17.3 pmol/l in the moderate ponderal index tertile, and 19.6 pmol/l in the high ponderal index tertile (the high ponderal index group had significantly higher E2 than both low and moderate ponderal index groups, P = 0.0001). This study shows a positive association between ponderal index recorded for women at birth and levels of E2 measured during their menstrual cycles as adults. This suggests that conditions during fetal life influence adult production of reproductive hormones and may contribute to inter-individual variation in reproductive function. In addition, because large size at birth is one of the factors linked with an increased risk of breast cancer, our findings provide a physiological link for the observed positive relationship between indicators of energetic conditions during fetal growth and breast cancer in women.

AB  - The experiment of crossing Tsigai ewes with Romney-Marsh and with the half-breed Tsigai-Lincoln rams in the southern dry steppes is described. 1873 Tsigai ewes were used in the experiment. They were artificially inseminated with 12 rams. Four Tsigai, four Romney-Marsh and four half-breed Lincoln-Tsigai rams were used for the experiment. 1930 lambs were born. By random sampling technique 300 purebred and 300 crossbred 2 months old lambs were selected for weighing. The Tsigai rams were heavier than the crossbred ones by 0.8 kg and the ewe-lambs - by 2.0 kg, respectively. Then, individual records for 997 experimental ewe-lambs were carried out up to eighteen months It was found that purebred progeny is more productive and viable than crossbred one. By the time of weaning, 4 months old purebred lambs were heavier than the crossbred ones by 1.7 kg. At a year old, the Tsigai sheep were 0.7 kg heavier than the crossbred Tsigai-Romni-Marsh, and 2.67 kg heavier than the half breed Lincoln-Tsigai. According to the wool clip at one year of age, these differences were 0.17 and 0.19 kg, respectively. The wool length of the crossbred ewe-lambs was 0.50 and 0.47 cm longer, but their wool in this indicator had greater variability, which is undesirable for homogenous wool. Crossbreds were also inferior according to the features expressed in points: class by 038 and 2.67 points, viability - 0.38 and 0.56 points and consolidated estimate - 1.79 and 326 points. When estimating all 12 rams for the complex of useful progeny features, two reliable improvers both Tsigai were found. Four reliable deteriorators were also identified, two of which were Romney-Marsh and two half breed Tsigai-Lincoln. All rams were kept in a special sheepherd in good conditions. Observing the Romney-Marsh (4 heads) and half breed Lincoln-Tsigai (4 heads) rams showed that they were constantly depressed, fell behind the Tsigai rams on the pasture, in moving and even at camps. The main conclusion of the experiment is that crossbreds are significantly inferior to Tsigai sheep in their viability, which is very important to know when breeding sheep in the harsh conditions of dry steppes and semi-deserts. The experiment gives ground to confirm that crossbreeding Tsigai sheep with Romney-Marsh and Lincoln cannot be achieved, at least, in the conditions of dry steppes. This zone doesn't require searching for countless combinations of breeds for crossbreeding because the analysis shows that experiment results are not as theoretically expected.

AB  - The authors have carried out scientific investigations of salt lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau since 1956 and collected 550 hydrochemical data from various types of salt lakes. On that basis, combined with the tectonic characteristics of the plateau, the hydrochemical characteristics of the salt lakes of the plateau are discussed. The salinity of the lakes of the plateau is closely related to the natural environment of lake evolution, especially the climatic conditions. According to the available data and interpretation of satellite images, the salinity of the lakes of the plateau has a general trend of decreasing from north and northwest to south and southeast, broadly showing synchronous variations with the annual precipitation and aridity (annual evaporation/annual precipitation) of the modern plateau. The pH values of the plateau salt lakes are related to both hydrochemical types and salinities of the lake waters, i.e., the pH values tend to decrease from the carbonate type -> sodium sulfate subtype -> magnesium sulfate subtype -> chloride type; on the other hand, a negative correlation is observed between the pH and salinities of the lakes. Geoscientists and biological limnologists generally use main ions in salt lakes as the basis for the hydrochemical classification of salt lakes. The common ions in salt lakes are Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Cl- SO4 (2-), CO3 (2-), and HCO3 (-). In this paper, the Kurnakov-Valyashko classification is used to divide the salt lakes into the chloride type, magnesium sulfate subtype, sodium sulfate subtype and carbonate type, and then according to different total alkalinities (K (C) = Na2CO3 + NaHCO3/total salt x 100%) and different saline mineral assemblages, the carbonate type is further divided into three subtypes, namely, strong carbonate subtype, moderate carbonate subtype and weak carbonate subtypes. According to the aforesaid hydrochemical classifications, a complete and meticulous hydrochemical classification of the salt lakes of the plateau has been made and then a clear understanding of the characteristics of N-S hydrochemical zoning and E-W hydrochemical differentiation has been obtained. The plateau is divided into four zones and one area. There is a genetic association between certain saline minerals and specific salt lake hydrochemical types: the representative mineral assemblages of the carbonate type of salt lake is borax (tincalconite) and borax-zabuyelite (L2CO3) and alkali carbonate-mirabilite; the representative mineral assemblages of the sodium sulfate subtype are mirabilite (thenardite)-halite and magnesium borate (kurnakovite, inderite etc.)-ulexite-mirabilite; the representative mineral assemblages of the magnesium sulfate subtype are magnesium sulfate (epsomite, bloedite)-halite, magnesium borate-mirabilite, and mirabilite-schoenite-halite, as well as large amount of gypsum; The representative mineral assemblages of the chloride type are carnallite-bischofite-halite and carnallite-halite, with antarcticite in a few individual salt lakes. The above-mentioned salt lake mineral assemblages of various types on the plateau have features of cold-phase assemblages. Mirabilite and its associated cold-phase saline minerals are important indicators for the study of paleoclimate changes of the plateau.
   A total of 59 elements have been detected in lake waters of the plateau now, of which the concentratons of Na, K, Mg, Ca, and Cl, and SO4 (2-), CO3 (2-), and HCO3 (-) ions are highest, but, compared with the hydrochemical compositions of other salt lake regions, the plateau salt lakes, especially those in the southern Qiangtang carbonate type subzone (I-2), contain high concentrations of Li, B, K, Cs, and Rb, and there are also As, U, Th, Br, Sr, and Nd positive anomalies in some lakes. In the plateau lake waters, B is intimately associated with Li, Cs, K and Rb and its concentration shows a general positive correlation with increasing salinity of the lake waters. The highest positive anomalies of B, Li, Cs, and K center on the Ngangla Ringco Lake area in the western segment of the southern Qiangtang carbonate type subzone (I-2) and coincide with Miocene volcanic-sedimentary rocks and high-value areas of B, Li, and Cs of the plateau. This strongly demonstrates that special elements such as B, Li, and Cs on the plateau were related to deep sources. Based on recent voluminous geophysical study and geochemical study of volcanic rocks, their origin had close genetic relation to anatectic magmatism resulting from India-Eurasia continent-continent collision, and B-Li (-Ce) salt lakes in the Cordillera Plateau of South America just originated on active continental margins, both of which indicate that global specific tectonically active belts are the main cause for the high abundances of B, Li, and Cs (K and Rb) in natural water and mineralization of these elements.

AB  - The Late Jurassic Walloon Subgroup (recently dated as Oxfordian) is a productive, subbituminous coal seam gas source in the Surat Basin and can be subdivided from bottom to top into the Taroom Coal Measures, the Tangalooma Sandstone, the Lower and Upper Juandah Coal Measures, which have different coal character. The lower Taroom coals are commonly thick, associated with sandstones and interpreted to form as base level is rising, creating sodden anoxic conditions for peat accumulation. The middle Tangalooma to Lower Juandah contains fewer and thinner coals, and transitions upwards from a sandstone to siltstone dominated sequence responding to inundation with the development of floodplain lakes. The strata then coarsen upward in both grain size and coal thickness in the Upper Juandah Coal Measures, which may be eroded by an overlying unit, the Springbok Sandstone. This unconformable surface is basin wide and depending on age, can be tied into global changes in climate and base level.
   Existing models for peat growth under changing base level and the variability in terms of the conditions of peat formation through time, as well as throughout the basin, are tested. Environment of peat deposition and changes therein, are investigated by petrographic analysis of the Walloon coals, coupled with high resolution lithotype logging of core and organic stable carbon isotope analysis.
   Fine microlayering and abundance of root suberinite, telo- and detrovitrinite indicate precursory peat formation in a mostly herbaceous marsh to fen environment, in which bigger trees are either infrequent or absent, except for the lower seams of the Taroom Coal Measures and the upper seams of the Lower Juandah Coal Measures, where bright bands are thicker (>= 10 mm) and more frequent. No extended periods of dehydration-oxidation (<1 vol.% mmf inertinite group macerals) are indicated until the deposition of the Upper Juandah Coal Measures that contain greater amounts (5 to 15 vol.% mmf with rare 68 vol.%) of inertinite group macerals. Suberinite is interpreted to reflect dense root mats that are resistant to decay by microbial activity. They leave behind their suberinised exoderms, which originally helped wetland plants to protect themselves from deleterious solutes or in case of a change to drier conditions provided protection from desiccation. The most common inertinite maceral found in the Upper Juandah Coal Measures is inertodetrinite, associated with detrovitrinite. After bush or swamp fires, pieces of charcoal on dried out peat surfaces are easily blown away by the wind and accumulate with sediment in standing water. Fusinites and semifusinites are mainly associated with telovitrinites and are likely to be the result of desiccation and (fungal) mouldering in addition to fire.
   Stable carbon isotopes of coal show a distinct positive shift in the Lower Juandah Coal Measures that sets in well before the increased inertinite content in the Upper Juandah Coal Measures. The enrichment in C-13 could be linked to a change in climate during the high stand depositional cycle, marking the onset of late stage falling, where base level begins to drop, later creating exposures and water stress. A shift to a less humid climate in the Upper Juandah Coal Measures could have favoured the conditions for desiccation, mouldering and bush fires, which is reflected in the coal's maceral composition. The Surat Basin delta C-13 isotope trend follows the global trend found in marine carbonate samples from the same age interval that corroborates increasing enrichment towards the top of the coal measures (approximately middle Oxfordian), followed by a shift to more negative compositions, which corresponds to the onset of the Springbok Sandstone deposition on an unconformable surface.

AB  - The quality of the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain is determined by several factors that lead to different physical, chemical, and/or rheological characteristics. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of the type of cultivar quality and agricultural region of production on parameters that define the commercial and industrial quality of wheat. A total of 3,486 wheat samples were collected from producer lots. The samples corresponded to commercial cultivars classified according to the quality type following a system used in Argentina which is based on the combination of commercial and baking quality indicators. These wheat varieties were produced in three different regions according to resource availability (fertility of the soil and average rainfall). The technological quality of the different grain samples and flours was determined by means of physicochemical analyses. The samples from the region of high resource availability with higher productivity and lower industrial quality differed from those from the regions of low and medium resource availability. Grain test weight and ash content were significantly affected by the interaction between the quality group of the cultivars and the region of origin. Grain protein and gluten contents were mainly conditioned by the resource availability of the region. However, the quality of the gluten was genetically conditioned by quality group of the cultivars. As results of the relationships among these parameters, most of the variables of flour quality (color, deformation energy, tenacity/extensibility ratio, and farinograph stability) would be explained by the interaction between the cultivar and the environment where it was grown.

AB  - Few global syntheses of oxygen and carbon isotope composition of pedogenic carbonates have been attempted, unlike marine carbonates. Pedogenic carbonates represent in-situ indicators of the climate conditions prevailing on land. The delta O-18 and delta C-13 values of pedogenic carbonates are controlled by local and global factors, many of them not affecting the marine carbonates largely used to probe global climate changes. We compile pedogenic oxygen and carbon isotopic data (N = 12,167) from Cretaceous to Quaternary-aged paleosols to identify potential trends through time and tie them to possible controlling factors. While discrete events such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum are clearly evidenced, our analysis reveals an increasing complexity in the distribution of the delta O-18 vs delta C-13 values through the Cenozoic. As could be expected, the rise of C-4 plants induces a shift towards higher delta C-13 values during the Neogene and Quaternary. We also show that the increase in global hypsometry during the Neogene plays a major role in controlling the delta O-18 and delta C-13 values of pedogenic carbonates by increasing aridity downwind of orographic barriers. Finally, during the Quaternary, an increase of 3 parts per thousand in delta O-18 values is recorded both by the pedogenic carbonates and the marine foraminifera suggesting that both indicators may be used to track global climate signal.

AB  - Fusarium head blight (FHB) is one of the main fungal diseases affecting bread (Triticum aestivum L.) and durum wheat (Triticum durum L.) crops worldwide, resulting not only in important economic losses due to reduced grain yield and quality, but also in grain safety due to mycotoxins contamination, mainly deoxynivalenol (DON). TRI5 gene catalyzes the first step in DON biosynthesis and its expression is used as an indicator for trichothecene synthesis induction. In Argentina, FHB is caused by Fusarium graminearum sensu stricto when humid weather and warm temperature conditions predominate around flowering. Commonly used strategies to manage FHB are not highly efficient if individually applied and under this scenario. Biological control appears as a viable approach than can be included in an integrated FHB management. Previous studies carried out by our research group proved the biocontrol efficacy of Bacillus velezensis RC 218 in reducing FHB in bread and durum wheat, under greenhouse and field conditions. In this study, we analyzed F. graminearum sensu stricto penetration, growth and TRI5 gene expression when B. velezensis RC 218 was applied on wheat spikes. Spike tissue sections were obtained and observed under different microscopic techniques. We observed that the biocontrol agent (BCA) was able to reduce F. graminearum infection and trichothecene accumulation in bread wheat susceptible cultivar BioInta1005. Data on tissue analysis suggest B. velezensis RC 218 induced cell wall thickening in the host tissues immediately surrounding the F. graminearum infection site, preventing cell plasmolysis and collapse.

AB  - Few pteridophytes have proven the capacity to accumulate and remediate heavy metals from contaminated soils.Pityrogramma calomelanos, a non-seasonal fast-growing, a cosmopolitan fern, is a good indicator of environmental conditions, was used in the present study. The life cycle of ferns alternates with haploid gametophyte and diploid sporophyte. The present study was undertaken to access the effect of mercury, in form of mercury (II) chloride [(HgCl2)] and lead as lead nitrate [Pb(NO3)(2)] in developmental studies usingin vitrospore germination. Periodic recording of the germination, protonemal growth, rhizoid formation and differentiation of sex organs in different concentrations of heavy metals were conducted for a period of 6 weeks. It was found that the percentage of spore germination and the number of protonemal cells reduced significantly causing developmental defects in the presence of HgCl(2)as compared to Pb(NO3)(2)(p < 0.0001). A significant decrease in the number of archegonial count and chlorophyll content was observed in different concentrations of the heavy metals tested. Gametophytes ofP. calomelanosrecorded lead uptake of 646.51 +/- 0.93 mg/kg in treatments of 25 ppm of lead and high mercury accumulation up to 1,885 +/- 1.98 mg/kg at 10 ppm of mercury, indicating successful uptake of heavy metals. Novelty statement:Pityrogramma calomelanosis gaining interest amongst pteridologists upon proving its exclusive capacity of phytoremediation. It is superior in comparison to the most popular, patented fernPteris vittata. Our study demonstrates the effective use of the promising fern in its simplest, nonvascular form of gametophytes as a phytoremediation agent in controlled conditions.

AB  - The experiment showed a potential correction of the free radical oxidation in the rats' membrane lipids by means of oral injection of Thalictrum Foetidum aqueous extract, contains a complex of natural antioxidants.
   The experimental animals were divided into 6 groups (6 animals per group). The experimental animals from group 1 and the animals from group 2, which had been subjected to stress by immobilization for 5 hours, were given 1.5 ml of distil water orally/intragastrically. The animals from group 3, 4, 5 and 6 were given 0.5 ml, 1,0 ml, 1,5 ml and 2,0 ml correspondingly of Thalictrum Foetidum extract orally/intragastrically every day an 1 hour before stress exposition. The animals from all the groups were decapitated under ether anesthetic 5 hours after simulating immobilization stress, notably in the condition of the maximum stress exposition. Blood serum was used for the experiment. There was estimated lipid peroxide oxidation and the condition of the antioxidant system by the spectrophotometric method. For some chances to be observed in the indicators under research, the latter were determined in the control and experimental animals after 5, 15 and 30 days.
   According to the experimental results, only the 15th and the 30th day, i.e. under chronic stress, show a statistically credible reduction in these indicators as to immobilization stress, approximating the control groups.
   Analyzing the results of the experiment, we may conclude that Thalictrum Foetidum liquid extract has a rather gentle effect on the lipid peroxide oxidation and antioxidant system under immobilization stress.

AB  - We used the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to predict and explain maize and soybean yields, phenology, and soil water and nitrogen (N) dynamics during the growing season in Iowa, USA. Historical, current and forecasted weather data were used to drive simulations, which were released in public four weeks after planting. In this paper, we (1) describe the methodology used to perform forecasts; (2) evaluate model prediction accuracy against data collected from 10 locations over four years; and (3) identify inputs that are key in forecasting yields and soil N dynamics. We found that the predicted median yield at planting was a very good indicator of end-of-season yields (relative root mean square error [RRMSE] of similar to 20%). For reference, the prediction at maturity, when all the weather was known, had a RRMSE of 14%. The good prediction at planting time was explained by the existence of shallow water tables, which decreased model sensitivity to unknown summer precipitation by 50-64%. Model initial conditions and management information accounted for one-fourth of the variation in maize yield. End of season model evaluations indicated that the model simulated well crop phenology (R-2 = 0.88), root depth (R-2 = 0.83), biomass production (R-2 = 0.93), grain yield (R-2 = 0.90), plant N uptake (R-2 = 0.87), soil moisture (R-2 = 0.42), soil temperature (R-2 = 0.93), soil nitrate (R-2 = 0.77), and water table depth (R-2 = 0.41). We concluded that model set-up by the user (e.g. inclusion of water table), initial conditions, and early season measurements are very important for accurate predictions of soil water, N and crop yields in this environment.

AB  - Normally discarded as waste, ovine tendon collagen has great potential for use as an injectable hydrogel. Typical collagen used for biomedical applications is derived from epidermal tissue. Compared to the epidermal collagen, tendon collagen consists of collagen fibrils with large diameters. This limits the conjugation of phenolic hydroxyl (Ph) groups to tendon collagen for the synthesis of an injectable hydrogel. In this study, pretreatment process by ultrasonication was used to prevent the aggregation of ovine tendon collagen fibril, thus reducing fibril diameters and increasing the surface area for effective conjugation of Ph groups to collagen-chitosan (Col-Chit) composite. In situ gelation of Col-Chit-Ph composite was achieved via peroxidase-catalyzed crosslinking reaction at physiological conditions. The collagen to chitosan (Col: Chit) ratio was found to significantly influence the physical, mechanical and biological properties of hydrogels. The higher composition of chitosan in the hydrogel with 1:1 Col: Chit ratio resulted in the shortest gelation time (< 1 minute) and higher mechanical strength (> 0.35 N) in all conditions. However, the poor cell growth rate of hydrogel at this Col: Chit ratio might limit its further use. The hydrogel with 3:2 Col: Chit ratio was mechanically stable and has the highest cell growth rate among others with difference of cell growth rate of about 94 % compared to the 1:1 ratio. Taking into account these biological features, hydrogel with 3:2 Col: Chit ratio is suggested for potential use in biomedical applications. This study shows the feasibility of using ultrasonic pretreatment method for collagen with large fibril diameter. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by IASE.

AB  - Existing infrastructure is aging, while the demands are growing for a better infrastructure system in response to the high standards of safety, health, population growth, and environmental protection. Bridges are subjected to severe deterioration agents such as variable traffic loading, deferred maintenance, cycles of freeze and thaw. The development of Bridge Management Systems (BMSs) has become a fundamental imperative nowadays due to the huge variance between the need for maintenance actions and the available funds to perform such actions. Condition assessment is regarded as one of the most critical and vital components of BMSs. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is one of the nondestructive techniques that are used to evaluate the condition of bridge decks which are subjected to the rebar corrosion. There is a major issue associated with the GPR which is the absence of a scale for the amplitude values. The objective of the proposed model is to compute standardized amplitude thresholds for corrosion maps. The proposed model considers eight un-supervised clustering algorithms to obtain the thresholds. The proposed model incorporates a multi-objective optimization-based methodology that employs three evolutionary optimization algorithms to calculate the optimum thresholds which are: (1) genetic algorithm, (2) particle swarm optimization algorithm, and (3) shuffled frog-leaping algorithm. Five multi-criteria decision-making techniques are used to provide a ranking for the solutions. Finally, group decision-making is performed to aggregate the results and obtain a consensus and compromise solution. The standardized thresholds obtained from the proposed methodology are: - 16.7619, - 8.8161, and - 2.9744 dB.

AB  - Grasses in the genus Urochloa, commonly known as brachiaria, are grown as forage crops in sub-Saharan Africa, with some genotypes being used in management of insect pests. However, spider mite, Oligonychus trichardti Meyer (Acari: Tetranychidae), has recently been reported as its major pest in the region. We evaluated 18 brachiaria genotypes to identify sources of resistance to O. trichardti, and to determine their adaptability to different environments in western Kenya. Response to artificial infestation with O. trichardti was evaluated under controlled conditions in a screenhouse while adaptability to different environments and field resistance to mites was evaluated in three locations for two cropping seasons in 2016 and 2017 under farmers' conditions. The parameters evaluated as indicators of resistance to pest damage included leaf damage, chlorophyll content reduction, plant height, leaf area, number of tillers and shoot biomass. Rainfall played a role in reducing mite infestation and increasing biomass yield of the genotypes. Significant correlations between parameters were only observed between leaf damage and yield (r = -0.50), and leaf damage and chlorophyll loss (r = 0.85). The cultivar superiority index (Pi) ranked Xaraes, Piata, ILRI 12991 and ILRI 13810 as reliable genotypes that combined moderate resistance to the mite (Pi <= 48.0) and high biomass yield (Pi <= 8.0). Since this is the first documentation of interactions between O. trichardti and different brachiaria genotypes, we propose these genotypes as potential candidates for improved forage yields in areas prone to O. trichardti infestation in Africa.

AB  - Concern overdwindlingwater supplies for urban areas aswell as environmental degradation fromexisting urban water systems has motivated research into more resilient and sustainable water supply strategies. Greywater reuse has been suggested as a way to diversify local water supply portfolios while at the same time lessening the burden on existing environments and infrastructure. Constructed wetlands have been proposed as an economically and energetically efficient unit process to treat greywater for reuse purposes, though their ability to consistently meet applicable water quality standards, microbiological in particular, is questionable. Wetherefore review the existing case study literature to summarize the treatment performance of greywater wetlands in the context of chemical, physical and microbiological water quality standards. Based on a cross-section of different types of wetlands, including surface flow, subsurface flow, vertical and recirculating vertical flow, across a range of operating conditions, we showthat although microbiological standards cannot reliably be met, given either sufficient retention time or active recirculation, chemical and physical standards can. We then review existing case study literature for typical water supply disinfection unit processes including chlorination, ozonation and ultraviolet radiation treating either raw or treated greywater specifically. An evaluation of effluent water quality from published wetland case studies and the expected performance from disinfection processes shows that under appropriate conditions these two unit processes together can likely produce effluent of sufficient quality to meet all nonpotable reuse standards. Specifically, wesuggest that recycling vertical flowwetlands combined with ultraviolet radiation disinfection and chlorine residual is the best combination to reliably meet the standards.

AB  - Agriculture is one of the primary sectors that is expected to be affected globally by climate change. In this regard, prior knowledge on possible yield reactions of crop yield to changing environmental conditions is essential for decision makers. Hence, comprehensive studies on the estimation of adaptation abilities of globally grown crops are needed as indicators of related future risks and benefits. A guiding research is presented in this study as the first step by aforementioned means in northwestern Turkey (the Thrace Region). This region comes to the forefront particularly by its wheat, rice and sunflower productions, which are superior to Turkey's averages. Aim of the study is to present the adaptation ability of winter wheat grown to possible climate change by consideration of grain yield. To achieve this, two explanatory crop growth simulation models, CERES-Wheat and WOFOST, were applied in the Kirklareli city of the region. Desired databases were supplied with virtual past and real time inputs of dynamic crop, soil, and atmosphere system. Then, two-step model calibrations were applied for the representation of the past and current outputs considering major yield components of the winter wheat. This was followed then by the model validation process including variations in future climate inputs like solar radiation, temperature, precipitation and CO2. Lastly, related daily outputs of a regional climate model according to the AM climate change scenario were arranged for the coordinates of the selected parcels and the obtained data used as the meteorological inputs of CERES-Wheat and WOFOST for growing seasons within the 2013-2100 period.

AB  - In order to improve the bioavailability of substances with limited water-solubility, they are often formulated as nanoparticles. Nanoparticles show enhanced dissolution properties when compared to large particles. In this paper a dissolution theory is presented that comprehensively describes the dissolution properties of both large- and nanoparticles. It comprises non-sink conditions and arbitrary shaped isometrically dissolving particles, considering particle-size-independent dissolution layer thickness and several polymorphic drug forms. The known root-laws of dissolution kinetics happen to be special cases that depend on particle-size in relation to the diffusion layer thickness i.e. whether the particles are much larger, comparable, or much smaller than the diffusion layer thickness. The presented theory explains the improved dissolution properties of nanoparticles, such as their increased solubility, almost immediate dissolution, and the dissolution kinetics which is independent from hydrodynamic conditions. For polydisperse, polymorphic particles of arbitrary shapes that are liberated from a disintegrating finished dosage form, the Ostwald ripening (coarsening of particles and transition of metastable polymorphic forms into a more stable crystalline form) is described as water mediated mass transport. The presented theory points to certain limitations of the Ostwald-Freundlich equation for nanoparticles and provides their better characterization. This way it may contribute to a more specifically targeted development of finished dosage forms and may help to reduce the bias of toxicological and environmental assessments especially for drugs that are formed as nanoparticles.

AB  - Dongting Lake, a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention, is the hydrological lynchpin of the Yangtze floodplain. It is subjected to eutrophication and heavy metal pollution, but little is known of recent rapid degradation of its aquatic environment and potential causes. Here, we use sedimentary records of particle size, elements and pigments, combined with historical hydrological and limnological data, to assess aquatic environmental changes since ca 1960. Coarse particles in the sediments increased after 2003, while concentrations of K, Li, Al and Mg declined. These changes are probably linked to strong erosion of the downstream riverbed and declining supply of ion-rich material from the upper Yangtze reaches after the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) began to operate. Furthermore, enrichment of sedimentary heavy metals and total phosphorus since the 1990s can be attributed to the influx of anthropogenic pollutants. Biotic responses are manifested in higher concentrations of fossil algal pigments, especially those from chlorophytes and siliceous algae after the TGD impoundment. Multivariate analysis revealed that changes in fossil pigments were significantly correlated with total phosphorus and Pb and three indicators for hydrological conditions (i.e. coarse particles, water exchange ratio and sediment discharge), indicating that influx of anthropogenic pollutants and hydrological regulation by the TGD are main drivers of algal community change. Our results provide reference conditions for restoration of Dongting Lake and highlight the importance of hydrological connection with the mainstream and pollution control for continuing efforts to restore Dongting Lake, as well as other similar floodplain lakes worldwide.

AB  - Community-based water storage in semi arid areas can help to adapt to climate change and mitigate household water shortages. Since little is known on the downstream effects of local water storage, this study employs a water balance model to perform a catchment scale assessment of upscaling local scale water storage in sand dams. The impacts of increasing water storage is evaluated under current climate conditions and future climate change scenarios. Survey information is used to estimate current and future water demand and assess the benefits derived from current sand dams in the Ethiopian study area. Using an indicator of the environmental flow concept, downstream hydrological impacts are simulated for different scenarios. Storage by 613 dams, supplying water to 555,000 people, has no impact on environmental flow downstream of the sand dams. Storage by 2190 dams leads to a modest increase in the number of months with low flow (4 to 9 %). Projected climate change leads to a larger increase in the number of low flow months of 0 to 29 %. Joint climate change and maximum storage scenarios cause an increase in low flow months from 4 to 50 %. Under the most extreme climate change projection 4.5 % of the wet season discharge is stored in sand dams. Because of the local benefits of improved water supply and the acceptable range of downstream impacts, sand dams appear to be a viable way for supplying drinking water in this catchment as well as in other semi-arid regions with similar conditions.

AB  - Spatially resolved measurements of analyte emission along the cross-sectional axis of an axially viewed inductively coupled plasma (ICP) are utilized to indicate the presence of any of the three major categories of matrix interferences (i.e., plasma-related, sample introduction-related, and spectral interferences). Barium at concentrations of 0.05 or 0.1 M was chosen as a prototype element for plasma-related matrix effects, whereas common mineral acids (nitric, hydrochloric, sulfuric, and phosphoric) at volumetric concentrations from 1% to 20% were used to simulate sample introduction-related matrix effects. Three spectrally interfering line pairs (As and Cd at 228.81 nm, Er and Co at 239.73 nm, and Er and Ce at 302.27 nm) were selected for the study of spectral interferences. Due to dependence on the nature of the interference, the analytical bias at the center of the cross-sectional profile varied between -40% and +50%. In all matrix-interference categories, because plasma characteristics and excitation conditions are heterogeneous along this cross-sectional axis, matrix-induced shifts in analyte emission vary accordingly. As a result, the concentrations determined for an analyte along the cross-sectional plasma axis are not constant but exhibit a position dependence that allows the interference to be flagged. With the exception of spectral interference from emission lines whose total excitation potentials (i.e., the sum of ionization and excitation energies of an ionic emission line) are very close, the spatially resolved concentrations provide an effective indicator for flagging any other matrix interference in axial-viewing ICP-emission spectrometry. The method can be employed under the plasma forward power and carrier-gas flow conditions that are common for robust plasma operation.

AB  - Fossil phytolith assemblages from a 154.5 m longdrill core from the Lower Taieri Plain, Otago, New Zealand are presented. Transfer functions, based on modern phytolith assemblages from sites within the same region, were applied to the fossil phytolith data set, and validated using Modern Analogue Technique (MAT) assemblage matching. Analogues for much of the Holocene and some of the Last Interglacial (provisionally Oxygen Isotope Stage 5c) were obtained. Late Glacial/Holocene precipitation and pH estimates are consistent with other paleoclimate records from the Otago region. The phytolith-based precipitation and pH estimates may act as a combined proxy for soil weathering. The precipitation estimates may also act as a useful index of Effective Precipitation (EP). Temperature estimates derived have limited use for paleoclimate interpretation. Estimates produced for the mid-Holocene indicate a wetter environment than the present (50-100 mm greater EP) with increased soil weathering (high precipitation/low pH). Soil conductivity estimates were below estuarine levels during a diatom inferred marine transgression. This lack of phytolith response to conductivity changes is put down to a probable delayed development of suitable habitats for saltmarsh plant species during the rapid transgression. The Last Interglacial estimates indicate conditions somewhat drier (200 mm less EP) than the Holocene. Consistently low log conductivity (below 0.7 muS cm) estimates from the Last Interglacial contrast with the estuarine environments of the Holocene, indicating freshwater conditions in the Plain during at least part of the Last Interglaciation.

AB  - The associations between reproductive effort, as assessed by variation in natural clutch size and experimentally altered brood size, breeding success, and prevalence of blood parasite infections were studied in blue tits, Parus caeruleus. Females infected with blood parasites during incubation had laid significantly smaller clutches than non-infected females, irrespective of female age and laying date. Infected and non-infected females did not differ in the length of incubation delay, the time spent incubating eggs, or in fledging success. However, nestlings reared by females that had infections during incubation fledged in significantly poorer condition than nestlings reared by non-infected females. These findings are consistent with the interpretation that parasites had a negative impact bn their blue tit hosts, but they do not exclude the possibility that the prevalence of haematozoans and reduction in reproductive output (clutch size) and success (fledging condition) were independently triggered by some third factor (e.g., energetic stress caused by variation in territory quality). However, the prevalence of parasites at day 14 posthatch was related to experimentally altered brood size: adult females and males rearing enlarged broods were more likely to be infected than those rearing control or reduced broods, although the opposite was true for juvenile females and males. From our results, we suggest that a naturally low reproductive output (clutch size) may be an indicator of low individual quality, and that there may be a trade-off between reproductive effort and immunocompetence.

AB  - Application of symbiotic system of filamentous algae and submerged plants in constructed wetlands is expected to further improve the sewage treatment performance. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of their relationship, researches on the combined purification of water quality by filamentous algae and submerged plants are still in the initial stage, and relative results are quite different. Herein, we chose Spirogyra as the model filamentous algae to construct a symbiotic system of Spirogyra - Ceratophyllum demersum on the basis of screening suitable submerged plants. According to the monitoring of multiple physiological indicators of filamentous algae and submerged plants in the symbiotic system, under the conditions of biomass of filamentous algae 3.5-4 g/L, NH3N concentration 6.22 mg/L, TP concentration 0.66 mg/L, neutral or weakly alkaline pH value, the inhibition effect between filamentous algae and submerged plants was minimal. Based on the optimization, the removal rate of NH3-N and TP could reach 91.53% and 86.52%, which were higher than systems consisted of several submerged plants or submerged plant and other species. In addition, under the dynamic water condition which was closer to the real environment, the system operated in proper flow rate could still efficiently treat the pollutants. Moreover, the improvement effect on DO of sewage in system was better compared with that of the static water system. The research results provided a new idea for further improving the treatment efficiency of constructed wetland and theoretical basis for the combined purification by submerged plants and algae in eutrophic water.

AB  - This paper analyzes a solar tower power plant driven by a heliostat solar field, which has no fuel consumption. Exergy and exergoenvironmental assessments are utilized to evaluate the sustainability of power, based on the Eco-Indicator 99 method. This solar system does not burn fuel, and therefore there is no generation of greenhouse gases (GHG) due to combustion. The direct normal irradiance per hour was considered to evaluate the performance of the plant. The results indicate that the heliostat field and solar receptor present the highest exergy destruction rates and are responsible for the highest environmental burden of plant. The worst components from an exergoenvironmental perspective were identified. The best case of the solar tower power plant considers a daily operation of 12 h. This condition produced the lowest specific environmental impact of electricity (0.543 mPt/kWh) and the highest exergy efficiency, 18.89%. However, this condition led to the highest environmental impact rate for components, 55.99 Pt/h, due to the net power of 104.69 MW. When the system operates for 24 h per day, the specific environmental impact of electricity is 0.95 mPt/kWh. The results are compared with the literature data. The effect of the energy storage system reduced the net power and increased the amount of molten salts. The environmental impact rate associated with components and total environmental impact rate have a dominant effect on the environmental performance of the plant. A sensitivity analysis showed the effect of operation time, which reduces exergy efficiency and increases the specific environmental impact of electricity.

AB  - Background: Subjective cognitive complaints (SCCs) are defined as belief of the decline of a cognitive condition compared with an earlier period of functioning. Many studies have shown the relationship between SCCs with objective neuropsychological results as well its dependency on psychological characteristics. Considering the complex nature of SCCs, this study tested the relationship between SCCs reported in the attention domain with the results obtained in neuro psychological attention tasks, as well as with psychological characteristics and among complaints reported in various domains of functioning.
   Material/Methods:Sixty participants over 60 years of age took part in the study. Subjects were tested for the intensity of SCCs in everyday functioning, psychological characteristics (mood; anxiety, state and trait; and personality traits) and various aspects of attention domain (switching, divided, and focus).
   Results: The SCC intensity reported in various areas of functioning was associated with each other as well as with psychological characteristics (personality traits, anxiety, and mood/depression). There were no significant relations between the SCC intensity reported in the attention domain and the outcomes obtained in neuropsychological attention tasks.
   Conclusions: Our results showed that the intensity of SCCs may be a result of subjects' psychological characteristics and that the tendency to report complaints in various spheres of functioning simultaneously may be observed. It seems to be important to consider that SCCs are related to several psychological factors when it is included in a cognitive diagnosis and treated as a direct indicator of a cognitive condition.

AB  - The work describes the results of assessing developmental stability and the degree of differentiation in Chionomys gud within Protected Areas of the Central and Western Caucasus. We characterised developmental stability in Chionomys gud in different eco-geographical conditions by means of fluctuating asymmetry levels (FA(nm)) in a series of cranium phenes in four geographical populations. Thus we estimated the effect of environmental factors on FA(nm) levels. We registered the highest FA(nm) value for the sample from middle mountains of the Central Caucasus, i.e. the vicinities of the village Elbrus. The environment conditions of the given sample were the most stressful for the species (annual average temperature below 5 degrees C and annual average precipitation below 1000 mm). Two-way ANOVA for factors "annual average temperature" and "annual average precipitation" verified a correlation between FA(nm) levels and complex effects of the two climatic factors. We evaluated the levels of interpopulation phenetic distances by the analysis of frequencies of phenes of nonmetric cranial traits in Chionomys gud populations. Maximum phenetic distances were revealed between geographically distant (over 300 km) populations of the Central and Western Caucasus. The degree of morphological differentiation of the samples from the Central Caucasus, which are apart at the absolute distance of 20-60 km, was less pronounced. Our results suggest that the level of phenetic distances is determined not only by the effect of territorial isolation, but also by climatic peculiarities of a particular locality.

AB  - Hurricanes cause infrastructure failures which can lead to contamination of impacted areas. The objective of the current study was to evaluate whether Hurricane Irma contributed towards sewage contamination of coastal beaches. Through this study we evaluated indicators of fecal pollution (fecal indicator bacteria [FIB], enterococci and fecal coliform) and physico-chemical parameters (salinity, pH, turbidity, and temperature) in coastal waters of the Florida Keys shortly after the hurricane. To augment available county sampling data, two sets of sampling efforts were conducted; one focused on collecting samples spatially throughout the Keys to assess whether areas closer to hurricane landfall were more highly impacted. The second was to collect temporally intensive samples at one location during falling tide to evaluate the hypothesis of groundwater contamination. Samples were analyzed for FIB using a new method called timed appearance of culture signal (TACS), which was subsequently calibrated using traditional membrane filter and chromogenic substrate methods. Results showed that coastal beach waters were characterized by elevated but sporadic levels of fecal indicator bacteria up to two months after the hurricane. Spikes were not correlated with physico-chemical characteristics of the water. Our temporally intensive sampling effort did not support the hypothesis that groundwater was a source of elevated FIB. Competing factors could have played a role in the sporadic nature of the FIB levels after the hurricane. We suggest that beach erosion may have flushed out sediments at beaches closer to the hurricane landfall location thereby improving water quality during dry conditions. We also suggest that during wet conditions a source of FIB could include runoff from debris staging areas. Preemptive beach closures immediately after the hurricane were justified due to the sporadic nature of FIB contamination.

AB  - In nature, animals are exposed to a broad range of threats imposed by predators, which may strongly influence the ecology of prey species directly or indirectly by affecting their behavior via fear of predation. Here, we studied wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus behavioral and physiological responses to simulated predation risk. Risk avoidance was analyzed by live trapping with control traps and traps treated with feces of common genet Genetta genetta (direct cue of risk) under new moon nights and following by simulated full moon conditions (indirect cue). The time devoted to foraging behavior and capture time were analyzed by video recording mice activity around traps. Food intake was calculated based on the amount of bait remaining in each trap. Fecal corticosterone metabolites (FCMs) were measured by enzyme-immunoassay as indicators of physiological stress responses. Fewer wood mice were captured during full moon, yet only non-breeding adult males clearly avoided common genet odor. Mice were captured sooner at night during the simulated full moon conditions and later in predator-treated traps. Foraging activity was lower when individuals faced predator's feces, but neither food intake nor FCM levels were affected by predation risk cues. Direct and indirect cues of predation risk selectively affected wood mice behavior, although behavioral responses seem to be modulated by different costs-benefit balances related to the individual's perception of risk. The lack of physiological responses to predation risk cues suggests that wood mice did not perceive them as reliable stressors or the response was too small or transient to be measured by FCM.

AB  - Hay meadows, which are managed using a low-intensity regime, are characterized by highly diverse vegetation but have declined significantly since the mid twentieth century. Remaining species-rich meadows are often protected by statutory designations and conservation management agreements. However, long-term studies of change in the composition of meadow vegetation, and investigations of the success of conservation over the long-term are rare. Fourteen sites, which had a long history of being managed for field dried hay, were resurveyed after 25 years and redundancy analysis was undertaken to investigate changes in community composition. Investigations of the effect of soil conditions, site size and spatial distribution of the meadow sites were carried out. Although overall community composition had changed significantly, the suite of species representative of the meadow community had been maintained, and species usually associated with more intensively managed grasslands had declined. However, there were losses of particular species of conservation importance such as Alchemilla glabra and Conopodium majus, and losses and gains of species varied from site to site. There was a significant increase in the homogeneity of the meadow vegetation between the two survey years. Comparisons of indicators of soil conditions suggested that there had been no significant change for the community as a whole but analyses of the species showing the most change indicated a decrease in soil fertility. Low-intensity management has been successful in maintaining the meadow community but consideration of changes in key species and losses at the site level is needed. More research is needed to establish whether fragmentation is starting to have an impact on diversity.

AB  - This paper presents a system for the detection of partial discharges (PD) in industrial applications based on One Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVM). The study stresses the detection of Partial Discharges (PD) as they represent a major source of information related to degradation in the equipment. PD measurement is a widely extended technique for condition monitoring of electrical machines and power cables to avoid catastrophic failures and the consequent blackouts. One of the most important keystones in the interpretation of partial discharges is their separation from other signals considered as not-PD especially in low SNR measurements. In this sense, the OCSVM is an interesting alternative to binary SVMs since it does not need a training set with examples of all the output classes correctly labelled. On the contrary, the OCSVM learns a model of the signals acquired when the equipment is in PD-free mode, defined as a state where no degradation mechanism is active, so one only needs to make sure that the training signals were recorded under this setting. These default mode signals are easier to characterize and acquire in industrial environments than PD and lead to more robust detectors that practically do not need domain adaptation to perform in scenarios prone to different types of PD. In fact, the experimental results show that the performance of the OCSVM is comparable to that achieved by a binary SVM trained using both noise and PD pulses. Finally, the method is successfully applied to a more realistic scenario involving the detection of PD in a damaged distribution power cable.

AB  - In plant breeding, one of the major challenges of genomic selection is to account for genotype-by-environment (G x E) interactions, and more specifically how varieties are adapted to various environments. Crop growth models (CGM) were developed to model the response of plants to environmental conditions. They can be used to characterize eco-physiological stresses in relation to crop growth and developmental stages, and thereby help to dissect G x E interactions. Our study aims at demonstrating how environment characterization using crop models can be integrated to improve both the understanding and the genomic predictions of G x E interactions. We evaluated the usefulness of using CGM to characterize environments by comparing basic and CGM-based stress indicators, to assess how much of the G x E interaction can be explained and whether gains in prediction accuracy can be made. We carried out a case study in wheat (Triticurn aestivum) to model nitrogen stress in a CGM in 12 environments defined by year x location x nitrogen treatment. Interactions between 194 varieties of a core collection and these 12 different nitrogen conditions were examined by analyzing grain number. We showed that (i) CGM based indicators captured the G x E interactions better than basic indicators and that (ii) genomic predictions were slightly improved by modeling the genomic interaction with the crop model based characterization of nitrogen stress. A framework was proposed to integrate crop model environment characterization into genomic predictions. We describe how this characterization promises to improve the prediction accuracy of adaptation to environmental stresses.

AB  - High mountain areas provide water resources for a large share of the world's population. The ongoing deglaciation of these areas is resulting in great instability of mountainous headwater regions, which could significantly affect water supply and intensify dangerous hydrological processes.
   The hydrological processes in mountains are still poorly understood due to the complexity of the natural conditions, great spatial variation and a lack of observation. A knowledge of flow-forming processes in alpine areas is essential to predict future possible trends in hydrological conditions and to calculate river runoff characteristics. The goal of this study is to gain detailed field data on various components of natural hydrological processes in the alpine areas of the North Caucasus and Central Tien Shan, and to investigate the possibility that the isotopic method can reveal important regularities of river flow formation in these regions. The study is based on field observations in representative alpine river basins in the North Caucasus (the Dzhankuat river basin) and the Central Tien Shan (the Chon-Kyzyl-Suu river basin) during 2013-2015. A mixing-model approach was used to conduct river hydrograph separation. Isotope methods were used to estimate the contribution of different nourishment sources in total runoff and its regime. delta O-18, delta D and mineralization were used as indicators. Two equation systems for the study sites were derived: in terms of water routing and runoff genesis. The Dzhankuat and Chon-Kyzyl-Suu river hydrographs were separated into 4 components: liquid precipitation/meltwaters, surface routed/subsurface routed waters.

AB  - The potential of using the latitudinal distributions of fossil wood genera as a proxy for Jurassic terrestrial climate conditions in western Laurasia was tested using a database of 386 entries. The fossil wood genera Brachyoxylon, Protaxodioxylon and Simplicioxylon are southern taxa, which have only occasionally extended north of 45 degrees N (all latitude references are to palaeolatitudes). Conversely, Protocedroxylon and Xenoxylon are mostly found at high latitudes. The standard deviation of the data on the palaeolatitudes of the northern genera is, however, much larger than that of the southern genera. This is interpreted as resulting from brief periodic southward extensions of the Protocedroxylon and Xenoxylon distributions, while the southern genera remained confined south of 40 degrees N. The interval during which the northern genera replaced the southern genera at mid-latitudes can be hypothesized to be times of global terrestrial climate cooling or increased rainfall. Comparisons between the spatiotemporal distributions of these 'northern' taxa and independent climate-sensitive indicators (clay mineral assemblages, oxygen isotopes, and neritic carbonate distribution) suggest that these genera were adapted to more humid conditions characterizing the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Accordingly, southward migrations of this climatic zone occurred during the Early and Late Pliensbachian, Early Toarcian, and Early Middle Oxfordian time intervals. These reconstructions are limited by the low resolution and restricted spatial coverage of the wood record. Therefore, further sampling at the ammonite zone level is needed. Nevertheless, the present study suggests that wood taxa distribution represents an underexploited but potentially powerful record of terrestrial environmental changes during the Jurassic Period.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify and discuss the reasons why business models fail, while also identifying the features necessary to develop a method that enables the evaluation of the implementation process of the business model, and is able to help in its development.
   Design/methodology/approach - The proposed method (roadmap for implementation of business models - RIBM) is composed of nine steps, and seven initials conditions (limitations). Such conditions reduce its complexity (e.g. performance management system is defined in the company).
   Findings - Some reasons why business models fail (alignment between value proposition and customer segment (value proposition); business model financial viability (costs and revenue); environmental constraints not fully integrated with the design of the business model (environment); business model execution (management), etc.) and made some considerations about the implementation of business models.
   Research limitations/implications - This work was developed in a small business (with a small team and the external member). The business complexity level and number of processes involved are much smaller when compared with a mid-size or large company. Another factor that contributed to mitigating the problem is that the enterprise had a well-structured report once the owners had made annual analysis and discussed how to improve and expand the business.
   Practical implications - In this application, RIBM showed a potential tool to minimize flaws in implementation processes of business models.
   Originality/value - The business model concept is relatively new in the literature. And because of its strategic importance has been the target of all major schools in the area. This work, in particular, deals with the question-related failures that occur in the process of implementing business models.

AB  - Enhancing the urban quality of life (QoL) is an explicit policy goal of many countries, yet it is rarely studied using models that relate objective measures of the urban environment to the subjective evaluations of residents. It thus often remains unclear how planning interventions in the urban environment may influence residents' satisfaction with their living conditions. In particular, during periods of significant urban growth, such as those recently observed in Switzerland, which result in diverse, unwanted threats to the local QoL (e.g., loss of green spaces, traffic congestions, and fear of crime). This study uses data from a sample of 1,693 residents that participated in a postal survey about urban QoL. The responses were combined with objective attributes of residential conditions, using geographic information systems. Structural equation models were calibrated to examine the direct and indirect effects of important indicators of urban QoL, namely safety in public spaces and access to central urban facilities. The study sheds further light on the mediating effects between objective characteristics and subjective evaluations that influence the urban QoL. The results showed predominantly low correlations between objective characteristics and subjective evaluations of urban QoL, which confirmed the findings of the few previous studies on this topic. Surprisingly, this study also found a strong link between objective access and perceived accessibility. This relation was explained by the spatial scope of the study region and suggested that the scale discordance theory should be tested in future research. The findings implied that variations in objective measures do not reliably represent differences as evaluated by residents.

AB  - Flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acids are known to contribute to plant resistance against pathogens, but there are few reports on the implication of flavonols in the resistance of grapevine against Plasmopara viticola, and none on the involvement of hydroxycinnamic acids. In order to analyze the effect of flavonols on P. viticola infection, variable amounts of flavonols were induced by different light conditions in otherwise phenologically identical leaves. Differences in content of leaf hydroxycinnamic acids were induced at the same time. A non-invasive monitoring of flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acids was performed with Dualex leaf-clip optical sensors. Whatever the light condition, there were no significant changes in flavonol or in hydroxycinnamic acid contents for control and inoculated leaves during the development of P. viticola until 6 days after inoculation. The violet-blue autofluorescence of stilbenes, the main phytoalexins of grapevine that accumulate in inoculated leaves, was used as an indicator of infection by P. viticola. The implication of leaf constitutive flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acids in the defence of Vitis vinifera against P. viticola could be investigated in vivo thanks to this indicator. The increase in stilbene violet-blue autofluorescence started earlier for leaves with low flavonol content than for leaves with higher content, suggesting that constitutive flavonols are able to slow down the infection by P. viticola. On the contrary, constitutive hydroxycinnamic acids did not seem to play a role in defence against P. viticola. The non-destructive nature of the methods used alleviates the major problem of destructive experiments: the large variability in leaf phenolic contents.

AB  - The East China Sea (ECS) is threatened by frequent Skeletonema costatum (S. costatum) blooms every year, which can cause severe environmental harm, as well as considerable economic losses. Remote sensing is an efficient tool for monitoring these harmful algal blooms (HABs) and studying concerned marine conditions. This study investigated two intensive S. costatum HABs in the ECS by analysis of water distribution and spatial-temporal pattern of four oceanographic parameters derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and QuickSCAT satellite data using multiple remote sensing approaches (composite imagery interpretation, classification, and parameters retrieval). Results show that high chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations and net primary production (NPP) decrease from the HAB areas toward the open sea. A peak of Chl-a (>10 mg m(-3)) and NPP (>5000 mg.C.m(-2).d(-1)) are considered indicators of large-scale S. costatum blooms in the ECS. Low sea surface temperature (SST; approximately 23 degrees C) are observed in S. costatum HAB areas. In early stages, winds in terms of direction and speed can bring nutrients to facilitate the formation of S. costatum blooms, but then sharply change into unfavorable conditions to cause the final disappearance of HABs. This study also explored multiple oceanographic explanations in the ECS from biochemical, meteorological, physical, and geological perspectives for a better understanding of such S. costatum HABs mechanisms.

AB  - One of the primary approaches to environmental conservation emphasizes economic development. This conservation-and-development approach often ignores how development affects sociocultural characteristics that may motivate environmental behaviors (actions that actively benefit or limit one's negative impacts on the environment). Evolutionary anthropologists espouse a theoretical perspective that supports the conservation-and-development approach. Others believe sociocultural factors are the foundation of environmental behavior and worry that development will erode the values and norms that may shape such behavior. My research assistants and I surveyed 170 individuals from eight villages in two communities in Bhutan to explore whether economic (wealth, market integration) or social (religious behaviors, environmental values, social capital) factors are better indicators of environmental behavior. I used multilevel modeling to analyze use of fuelwood, use of agricultural chemicals, and tree planting, and to determine whether social norms were associated with these behaviors. Although economic factors were more often associated with these behaviors than social factors, local conditions and control variables were the best indicators of behaviors. Furthermore, economic factors were not always associated with positive environmental outcomes. Instead, farmers attempted to make the best economic decisions given their circumstances rather than seeking to conserve resources. Although religion was not a strong predictor of any of the behaviors I examined, I found evidence that the understanding of Buddhist philosophy is growing, which suggests that social factors may play a more prominent role as Bhutan's development progresses. My results highlight the need for conservation planners to be aware of local conditions when planning and implementing policies aimed at motivating environmental behaviors and that economic and social motivations for conservation may not be mutually exclusive.

AB  - Bryophytes are often noted for their growth on specific rock types and their value as indicator species. However, some evidence suggests that restriction of a species to specific rock types may be less rigid and could vary under different environmental conditions. We assessed richness and distribution patterns of bryophytes at 22 rock outcrop locations in upstate New York (NY) and coastal Maine (ACAD). At each location, detailed surveys were done in five replicate 5-m by 2-m plots on vertical rock faces. We report on the 194 bryophyte species found in these surveys and present detailed analyses for the 137 species that occurred at two or more of the 22 locations. In general, liverworts were less likely to be dominant within a plot than mosses. Within-site dominance and frequency of liverworts were less well correlated to larger-scale frequency (number of locations and regions of occurrence). In NY, although there was no significant difference in bryophyte richness by rock type, rare species were more often found on calcium-containing rock types. Rock type, soil influence, number of liverwort species, and region were significant correlates with bryophyte species composition patterns. The importance of rock type in explaining species composition patterns was still significant though weaker when ACAD locations were included in the analysis. This difference resulted from a higher prevalence of leafy liverwort species on calcium-containing rock types in ACAD. Our results present further evidence that apparent restrictions to specific rock types may shift depending on environmental conditions such as increased humidity and narrower temperature extremes that occur along the north Atlantic coast.

AB  - [1] Oxygen and carbon isotope records are important tools used to reconstruct past ocean and climate conditions, with those of benthic foraminifera providing information on the deep oceans. Reconstructions are complicated by interspecies isotopic offsets that result from microhabitat preferences (carbonate precipitation in isotopically distinct environments) and vital effects (species-specific metabolic variation in isotopic fractionation). We provide correction factors for early Cenozoic benthic foraminifera commonly used for isotopic measurements (Cibicidoides spp., Nuttallides truempyi, Oridorsalis spp., Stensioina beccariiformis, Hanzawaia ammophila, and Bulimina spp.), showing that most yield reliable isotopic proxies of environmental change. The statistical methods and larger data sets used in this study provide more robust correction factors than do previous studies. Interspecies isotopic offsets appear to have changed through the Cenozoic, either (1) as a result of evolutionary changes or (2) as an artifact of different statistical methods and data set sizes used to determine the offsets in different studies. Regardless of the reason, the assumption that isotopic offsets have remained constant through the Cenozoic has introduced an similar to1-2degreesC uncertainty into deep sea paleotemperature calculations. In addition, we compare multiple species isotopic data from a western North Atlantic section that includes the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum to determine the most reliable isotopic indicator for this event. We propose that Oridorsalis spp. was the most reliable deepwater isotopic recorder at this location because it was best able to withstand the harsh water conditions that existed at this time; it may be the best recorder at other locations and for other extreme events also.

AB  - The basal portion of thr Ogallala Formation (= 'Laverne Formation') (Lower Pliocene) Beaver County, Oklahoma, contains an interesting assemblage of non-marine fossil molluscs that include both spinose and non-spinose forms of the aquatic gastropod species Pyrgophorus hibbardi. The origin and paleolimnological significance of the spinose morph has been a source of much conjecture that has influenced environmental reconstructions of this assemblage. In one hypothesis the spinose forms of P. hibbardi are assumed to be associated with brackish water conditions by analogy with some populations of a related hydrobiid Potamopyrgus jenkinsi. To test the hypothesis that the spinose forms lived under different water conditions than the non-spinose morphs, we analyzed 10 specimens each of the two varieties for stable oxygen and carbon isotope ratios in the shell aragonite.
   The mean isotope ratios for the smooth and spinose morphs show no significant difference (oxygen: t = 0.28, df = 18, P (T less than or equal to t) 0.78 n.s.; carbon: t = 0.96, df = 18, P (T less than or equal to t) 0.35 n.s). We conclude that the lack of a statistically significant difference between the means of the oxygen and carbon isotope values for the smooth and spinose morphs suggests that the two forms lived in waters having similar isotope signatures. The considerable range in oxygen isotope values recorded by both morphs of P. hibbardi, including values as high as 5-6 parts per thousand, suggest that both morphs were associated with waters which were periodically evaporatively enriched in O-18.

AB  - Pyrite framboids are densely packed, generally spherical aggregates of submicron-sized pyrite crystals. In this study, a survey was made of framboid size distributions in recently deposited sediments from euxinic (Black Sea; Framvaren Fjord, Norway; Pettaquamscutt River Estuary, Rhode Island, USA), dysoxic (Peru Margin), and oxic (Wallops Island, Virginia, USA; Great Salt Marsh, Delaware, USA) environments. Pyrite framboids in sediments of modern euxinic basins are on average smaller and less variable in size than those of sediments underlying dysoxic or oxic water columns. Down-core trends indicate framboid size distribution is a sediment property fixed very early during anoxic diagenesis, generally within the top few centimeters of burial. Size distributions in modern sediments are comparable with those in ancient sedimentary rocks, evidence that framboid size is preserved through advanced stages of diagenesis and lithification. It is proposed that where secondary pyrite growth is limited, as to preserve primary pyrite textures, framboid size distribution may be used to indicate whether fine-grained sedimentary rocks were deposited under oxic or anoxic conditions.
   The Crystal Size Distribution Theory relates framboid size to growth time and rate. On the basis of this theory, the characteristic smaller sizes of framboids in sediments of modern euxinic basins reflect shorter average growth times relative to oxic or dysoxic environments. In euxinic environments, framboid nucleation and growth occurs within anoxic water columns, and growth times are, on average, shorter because of hydrodynamic effects than when framboid nucleation and growth occurs within anoxic sediment porewaters underlying oxic water columns. A maximum framboid growth time of 0.4 years is indicated for framboids forming in the water columns of euxinic basins.

AB  - Two greenhouse studies were conducted with contrasting patterns of soil water availability and nitrogen (N) supply to extend our knowledge of the combined effect of these environmental factors on cultivar response of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Several parameters of water relations and photosynthesis were measured. Results showed that at the beginning of stem elongation and before imposing water stress, the low N treatment decreased leaf conductance and carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange rate (CER). This effect was more significant in the case of the cultivar Nesma than the other cultivars. Leaf conductance was a much better indicator of CER than chlorophyll content. Overall, water stress decreased leaf conductance. Under mild stress, Nesma and Merchouch 8 behaved similarly, but Nesma was more sensitive to water stress. Increased N decreased CER under water stress but tended to have no effect on chlorophyll concentration. Under well watered conditions, N application helped the plants maintain greater leaf conductance, CER, and chlorophyll concentration than low N supply. Cultivar and N effects on relative water content (RWC) were not significant. Under severe water stress, Nesma tended to keep its stomata more open under N stress, while stomata of Merchouch 8 were not sensitive to N level variation. High N decreased leaf RWC of Nesma and Merchouch 8 but had no effect on Saada. From this study we concluded that under non-water stressed conditions, added N increased leaf water conductance, CER, and chlorophyll. Under water stress, the cultivars responded differently to N application. High N decreased leaf conductance and relative water content. These results indicated that careful cultivar selection can complement good N management of wheat in areas prone to soil moisture stress.

AB  - A detailed field survey identified a late Neogene sedimentary succession which accumulated in ephemeral palaeolakes on the edge of the Kalahari Basin in the northwest of Transvaal Province, South Africa. Palygorskite and dolomite formed along lake margins which fluctuated between lacustrine and dry-land conditions. The sedimentary sequence presented an opportunity to investigate the interrelationships between these minerals and study their possible modes of formation, either by lacustrine sedimentation or pedogenic processes. Clay mineralogy, transmission and scanning electron microscopy and geochemical analysis revealed an increase in magnesium-enriched minerals, palygorskite and dolomite, within the pedogenically altered marginal lacustrine sediments. Field relationships showed that the dolomite is a replacive phase within the decomposing palygorskite, although the scanning electron micrographs do not display such unequivocal evidence for a direct replacive relationship. They suggest rather that the dolomite forms by neoformation from soil solutions, which included decomposition products released by the breakdown of the palygorskite. Seen in a regional context, subaerial pedogenic processes acted on marginal lacustrine sediments and resulted in the decomposition of smectite and neoformation of palygorskite. A change in climate to drier conditions encouraged the formation of calcrete in surrounding areas which increased the magnesium/calcium ratio in groundwaters. This increase was supplemented by evaporative concentration during the desiccation of the lacustrine environment. The high magnesium concentration led to the formation of the dolomite-rich dolocrete. This interpretive model is a means by which existing genetic models for calcareous pedocretes and those models that define the concentration of magnesium in groundwater and saline lacustrine environments can be combined. The pedogenic mineral relationships described are suggested as useful palaeoenvironmental indicators for the late Neogene/early Pleistocene of southern Africa.

AB  - Coastal areas are critical transition zones between marine and terrestrial domains that support a large diversity of species but are exposed to significant anthropogenic impacts. While most conservation and management strategies rely on understanding the drivers of diversity over large scales, the importance of small-scale variation in environmental conditions can be overlooked. Here we combined a descriptive and experimental approach to describe the spatio-temporal dynamics of sessile communities and of the population of the barnacle Chthamalus bisinuatus within Araca Bay, a transition zone in southeastern Brazil threatened by the expansion of the Sao Sebastiao Port. We compared the relative coverage of sessile organisms from rocky shores for 20 months and several population parameters of barnacles in three distinct regions of Araca Bay, a few hundred meters apart: the inner portion, close to the Mae Isabel River and the Port, the middle of the Bay, and the outer region, close to the bay entrance. Community structure varied significantly over these small spatial scales; the macroalga Ulva lactuca and the oyster Crassostrea sp. were more abundant in the inner portion of the Bay, where the influence of freshwater and organic pollution from Mae Isabel River is more intense. Recruitment and density of C. bisinuatus was higher on the shores close to the mouth of the Bay, but individual size increased as one moves into the bay. Experimental manipulation of barnacles originally recruiting at the outer part of the bay and translocated to both outer and inner positions showed that while recruitment is restricted at the inner region, barnacle growth and survival are higher than at the outer shore. Our results suggest that the gradient of physical conditions created along the Araca Bay can result in distinct dynamics of communities and populations and that the region close to the mouth of the bay is more dynamic, with a larger turnover of space. In the opposite direction, the inner part of the bay, which is closer to the Sao Sebastiao Port, is more prone to be disturbed by any large human modification on the coast as populations are less dynamic and communities tend to be monopolized by species associated with organic pollution. Besides providing useful data for the management of Araca Bay, our results also show that small-scale variation of environmental conditions can contribute to create distinct dynamics of populations and communities and should be addressed in assessments of environmental impacts on the coast.

AB  - During the lake deep drilling campaign PASADO in 2008, more than 500 m of lacustrine sediment was recovered from the maar lake Laguna Potrok Aike, Argentina. The major element composition was assessed at high resolution with an ITRAX X-ray fluorescence core scanner. The sharp boundary between a carbonate-bearing and a carbonate-free depositional system occurs at 13.5 cal. ka BP and marks the transition from glacial to Late Glacial sediments. Holocene and Late Glacial sediments can be distinguished by elements that are indicative of organic matter (Br, Cl) or calcite (Ca). Glacial sediments are characterized by elements that represent terrigenous clastic input (Fe, Ti, K, Si). Trace elements (Mn, Rb, V, Ni) accumulate with the bulk of lithogenic elements indicating frequent oxic conditions and rare diagenetic remobilization. Based on principal component analysis we interpret the scores of the first principle component as a summarizing indicator for climate-related variations of depositional conditions. During the Holocene climate changes mirror the total inorganic carbon profile, which was used as a proxy for lake-level reconstructions of the past 16 ka in previous studies. High scores in the first principle component probably reflect periods of increased chemical over mechanical weathering and developing soils and vegetation cover limiting sediment availability for erosional processes. These intervals often also show increases in total organic carbon values and total organic carbon/total nitrogen ratios, which are associated with periods of Antarctic warming in the last glacial. Geochemical variations of the clastic glacial sediments are explored by excluding carbonate-bearing sediments from principal component analysis. Although, in this lake, Ca is a purely clastic signal in carbonate-free sediments, it does not correlate with the bulk of indicators for terrigenous input. Instead Ca dominates a second principal component together with Sr. This component mainly distinguishes coarse grained layers from the remaining sediment. The main provenance of this coarse-grained material is suggested to be a basalt outcrop at the western shore. Low lake levels, high waves and flash-flood events may have increased the availability of basaltic sand during extremely cold, arid and windy conditions. High wind speeds and lack of vegetation may have facilitated the increased transport of coarse-grained material into the center of Laguna Potrok Aike. Decreases in the second principal component can be observed during Oxygen Isotope Stage 2 when increased dust input has been found in cores from Laguna Potrok Aike, the Southern Ocean and Antarctica.

AB  - Thermal energy storage (TES) methods stand out as a key technology that eliminates the supply-demand imbalance in cooling or heating systems. This paper focuses on investigating the charging performance of the solar-aided packed-bed latent heat TES system. An in-house 1D transient mathematical model is developed to simulate the latent heat TES system?s heat transfer phenomena. The TES tank is integrated with a flat plate solar collector to include the variable boundary condition effects of solar energy and ambient air. The enhanced thermal conductivity approach is implemented into the mathematical model to consider the natural convection effects of the PCM?s liquid phase, and the method is validated. The mathematical model of the packed bed latent heat TES tank is also validated with the experimental and numerical results from the literature. As design and working parameters, the mass flow rate of heat transfer fluid (HTF) and spherical storage material diameter are varied. Single-, double- and triple-phase change material (PCM) arrangements are also studied by varying the melting temperature of PCM along the flow direction. The time-wise variation of energetic and exergetic efficiencies of the integrated system, PCM mean temperature inside the storage tank, and the liquid fraction in flow direction are investigated. Further extensive parametric analyses are conducted for heating season months, i.e., November, December, January, and February. As a result, the best design and working conditions for the integrated latent heat TES system within the range investigated are proposed. Also, it is concluded that decreasing the capsule diameter and increasing the HTF?s mass flow rate has a positive effect on system indicators.

AB  - An optimum carbonaceous feedstock is determined for a syngas fueled solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) for enhanced performance and reduced levelized cost and CO2 emissions. Four configurations are investigated: simple SOFC, and SOFC with the anode and/or cathode gas recycling. The effect of enriching the gasification medium with oxygen is also investigated. Thermodynamics, economic and environmental aspects of the systems are then comprehensively compared. Finally, multi-criteria particle swarm optimization is employed considering various anode and cathode recycling ratios, and feedstock compositions. The results indicate that optimum values of local power output, and levelized cost and emissions are observed at higher current densities and fuel utilization factors. The SOFC with anode and cathode recycling performs better in almost all conditions. The results further indicate that enriching the gasification medium with oxygen can greatly improve system performance while increasing the levelized cost of products. The optimization results show that exergy efficiency, levelized cost of products, and levelized emissions respectively are 43.7%, 47.2 $/MWh, and 0.530 t/MWh, for a syngas fueled SOFC using air, and 44.2%, 67.9 $/MWh, and 0.481 t/MWh, for a syngas fueled SOFC using O-2-enriched air. An appropriate feedstock for a syngas fueled SOFC with anode and cathode gas recycling is CH2.315O0.027 with 77.2 wt% carbon, 15.0 wt% hydrogen, and 2.8 wt% oxygen to achieve a well-balanced condition between exergetic, economic, and environmental indicators. In general, anode and cathode gas recycling and feedstock composition are observed to be influential parameters on the performance of SOFCs.

AB  - A study was carried out in order to evaluate the germination, development and multiplication of Moringa oleifera Lam in vitro on different culture media, using seeds collected in an arid ecosystem. Murashige and Skoog (MS), Murashige and Skoog culture media and Gamborg (MSG), Water-Agar (0.8 %) and wet medium were evaluated in a completely randomized design with five replications. Variables related to germination, seedling development and its subsequent multiplication process were evaluated under in vitro conditions. The wet culture medium significantly outperformed (P <= 0.05) the rest of the media in accumulated germination (100 %) and physiological indicators associated with germination. The weight of the seed was the one that most contributed to the germination process. There was a low (P >= 0.05) percentage of contamination for all treatments. Likewise, in the growth and development of seedlings, the MS, Water-Agar and Wet media, stimulated (P <= 0.01) the production of leaves (7.08 +/- 1.2; 6.62 +/- 0.7; 5.50 +/- 0.9, in order) compared to the MSG (4.8 +/- 2.2), however, the latter stimulated more (P <= 0.01) number of shoots (0.20 +/- 0.5) than the media, wet and Water-Agar and developed seedlings with longer roots (76.92 +/- 17.6 mm) than the MS (P <= 0.05). For the multiplication, only the MS and MSG media with the addition of 4.44 mu L.mL(-1) of 6-BA allowed the production of explants, the MSG provided the highest (P <= 0.01) value with 31.54 % of explants. MS and MSG media are not necessary in seed germination under in vitro conditions, but essential in the growth process, development, multiplication of apical shoots.

AB  - Background The number of kernels per ear is one of the major agronomic yield indicators for maize. Manual assessment of kernel traits can be time consuming and laborious. Moreover, manually acquired data can be influenced by subjective bias of the observer. Existing methods for counting of kernel number are often unstable and costly. Machine vision technology allows objective extraction of features from image sensor data, offering high-throughput and low-cost advantages. Results Here, we propose an automatic kernel recognition method which has been applied to count the kernel number based on digital colour photos of the maize ears. Images were acquired under both LED diffuse (indoors) and natural light (outdoor) conditions. Field trials were carried out at two sites in China using 8 maize varieties. This method comprises five steps: (1) a Gaussian Pyramid for image compression to improve the processing efficiency, (2) separating the maize fruit from the background by Mean Shift Filtering algorithm, (3) a Colour Deconvolution (CD) algorithm to enhance the kernel edges, (4) segmentation of kernel zones using a local adaptive threshold, (5) an improved Find-Local-Maxima to recognize the local grayscale peaks and determine the maize kernel number within the image. The results showed good agreement (> 93%) in terms of accuracy and precision between ground truth (manual counting) and the image-based counting. Conclusions The proposed algorithm has robust and superior performance in maize ear kernel counting under various illumination conditions. In addition, the approach is highly-efficient and low-cost. The performance of this method makes it applicable and satisfactory for real-world breeding programs.

AB  - Several studies have shown that mean length is only slightly biased and hence a robust indicator of the total mortality (fishing and natural mortalities). However, these studies use models that typically assume equilibrium conditions and are expected to predict a much stronger relationship between mean length and fishing mortality than would be obtained from a model with more realistic assumptions. Here we predict changes in annual mean length with stochastic stock reduction analysis (SRA)-an age-structured model-that accounts for recruitment variation around an average stock-recruitment relationship and time-varying exploitation rate. We found that SRA-predicted mean length fluctuates considerably over exploitation rate, as opposed to equilibrium mean length, which consistently declined as exploitation rate climbed. Our finding suggests that the inference obtained from examining the relationship between fishing effects and mean length under equilibrium conditions could be misleading. Recommendations for resource managers
   Previous studies showed that equilibrium mean length-that is, assuming continuous and constant recruitment and constant total mortality over time-is a reliable indicator of fishing and natural mortalities, where changes in the observed mean length mimic the total mortality of the harvested population. By estimating mean length under sensible assumptions, such as accounting for recruitment variability around an average stock-recruitment relationship, and time-varying exploitation rate (fishing mortality), high exploitation rate does not necessarily result in a low mean length. Given that equilibrium approaches to estimate mortality as a function of mean length are still appealing, due to their simplicity and basic data requirement, caution must be exercised when interpreting the results.

AB  - The mechanisms of the magnetic susceptibility (MS) enhancement of loess from Arid Central Asia (ACA) have received much attention recently. Consensus varies about factors controlling the magnetic properties as well as the environmental implications, and much effort needs to be gone into how surface processes affect the MS. In this study, we collected 214 topsoil, near-surface loess, and fluvial sediment samples covering different elevations, climatic conditions, and vegetation from the Ili Valley in eastern ACA and analysed their magnetic properties and composition to investigate the factors influencing MS. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was employed to assess the relationship between environmental indicators and environmental factors. Our results show that (a) the concentration of pedogenic magnetic particles in the Ili loess and topsoils is limited. chi(lf) is higher in loess but lower in paleosol, mainly attributable to changes in wind intensity; (b) the mean chi(fd), chi(fd)%, and chi(lf) values of topsoil are lower in the desert steppe and forest-meadow zones, but highest in the montane steppe zone, and are not positively associated with vegetation coverage and the intensity of pedogenic processes; and (c) elevation exerts the most important impact on topsoil chi(fd) and chi(fd)%, while chi(lf) is influenced more by temperature than precipitation. (d) The magnetic enhancement could be mainly attributed to wind velocity; we also should consider elevation and other factors such as local material, climatic conditions, and distance to the dust source when interpreting the paleoclimatic or paleoenvironmental significance of magnetic parameters.

AB  - We investigated fossil benthic and planktonic foraminifera in sediment cores FV10-05 and FV10-06-2, off Fukuoka, southwestern Japan to evaluate the impact of the Tsushima Warm Current on coastal environments around the strait between southeastern Korea and southwestern Japan during the early to middle Holocene. A cluster analysis of benthic foraminifera in these cores established four sample clusters (A, B, C, and D), which are interpreted as indicators of relatively high energy condition due to wave/current processes. Clusters A and C, characterized by attached taxa, became dominant at similar to 6.6 ka. Such faunal changes are consistent with the current-influenced sedimentation, confirming that the Tsushima Warm Current reached its present-day distribution at that time. A hiatus at similar to 8-7 ka has been reported in cores from deeper water off Fukuoka, whereas our shallow core shows deposition under high energy conditions was continuous even at similar to 8-7 ka near the coast off river mouth. Across the strait, the maximum landward extent of benthic foraminifera occurred in the Nakdong River delta (southeastern Korea) in similar to 8-7 ka, and an outer bay fauna of benthic foraminifera with seagrass beds occurred transiently in the restricted bay of the San-in district (southwestern Japan) at that time. The evolution of the Tsushima Warm Current during the early to middle Holocene thus appears to play an important role in coastal environments not only in the strait areas between southeastern Korea and southwestern Japan, but also in the San-in district.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires Member States to develop appropriate assessment methods for the classification of the ecological status of their surface waters. Mediterranean region has lagged behind in this task, so we propose here the first developed method for Greek lakes, Hellenic Lake Macrophyte (HeLM) assessment method. This method is based on two metrics, a modified trophic index and maximum colonization depth C-max that quantify the degree of changes in lake macrophytic vegetation, as a response to eutrophication and general degradation pressures. The method was developed on the basis of a data set sampled from 272 monitoring transects in 16 Greek lakes. Sites from three lakes were selected as potential reference sites by using a screening process. Ecological quality ratios were calculated for each metric and for each lake, and ecological status class boundaries were defined. For the evaluation of effectiveness of the method, the correlations between individual metrics and final HeLM values and common pressure indicators, such as total phosphorus, chlorophyll a and Secchi depth, were tested and found highly significant and relatively strong. In addition, the ability of HeLM values and its individual metrics to distinguish between different macrophytic communities' structure was checked using aquatic plant life-forms and found satisfactory. The HeLM method gave a reliable assessment of the macrophytic vegetation's condition in Greek lakes and may constitute a useful tool for the classification of ecological status of other Mediterranean lakes.

AB  - Atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) has a significant impact on the spatial and temporal distribution of air pollutants. In order to gain a better understanding of how ABL affects the variation of air pollutants, atmospheric boundary layer observations were performed at Sanshui in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region over southern China during the winter of 2013. Two types of typical ABL status that could lead to air pollution were analyzed comparatively: weak vertical diffusion ability type (WVDAT) and weak horizontal transportation ability type (WHTAT). Results show that (1) WVDAT was featured by moderate wind speed, consistent wind direction, and thick inversion layer at 600 similar to 1000 m above ground level (AGL), and air pollutants were restricted in the low altitudes due to the stable atmospheric structure; (2) WHTAT was characterized by calm wind, varied wind direction, and shallow intense ground inversion layer, and air pollutants accumulated in locally because of strong recirculation in the low ABL; (3) recirculation factor (RF) and stable energy (SE) were proved to be good indicators for horizontal transportation ability and vertical diffusion ability of the atmosphere, respectively. Combined utilization of RF and SE can be very helpful in the evaluation of air pollution potential of the ABL.Implications: Air quality data from ground and meteorological data collected from radio sounding in Sanshui in the Pearl River Delta showed that local air quality was poor when wind reversal was pronounced or temperature stratification state was stable. The combination of horizontal and vertical transportation ability of the local atmosphere should be taken into consideration when evaluating local environmental bearing capacity for air pollution.

AB  - The intricate relationship between metabolism and growth is still largely unexplored in early life stages of fish. In the present study, two experiments were conducted to explore how standard metabolic rate (SMR) of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) larvae was related to differences in body size, growth rate and feeding environment. In two of the three trials of the first experiment, larval SMR decreased (up to 37%) after larvae experienced 3 days of sub-optimal feeding conditions. Inter-individual differences in SMR and nutritional condition (RNA-DNA ratio) were unrelated. In a second experiment, inter-individual differences in SMR were not explained by differences in short-term (otolith marginal increment width) or long-term (size-at-age, otolith diameter-at-age) growth indicators in well (ad libitum) fed larvae. Nevertheless, a negative relationship between SMR and otolith core diameter (formed between hatching and first feeding) was observed. In well-fed larvae, the relationship between SMR, temperature (T, 5-15 degrees C) and dry mass (DM, 60-3000 mu m, 10-24 mm body length) was equal to: SMR = 0.0528 (+/- 0.0047) * DM (0.8859) (+/- 0.0127) * e(T*0.1046) (+/- 0.0034) [mean (+/- SE), adj R-2 = 0.9302, n = 384]. This is the first study to report the effects of DM on SMR in Atlantic herring larvae over a wide range of T. The present results suggest that metabolic flexibility can exist, particularly when larvae experience contrasting feeding environments, which needs to be taken into account when evaluating factors affecting larval growth and survival in the sea.

AB  - Bacteria are a primary contaminant in natural surface water. The instream concentration of fecal coliform, a potential indicator of pathogens, is influenced by meteorological conditions and land-use characteristics. However, the relationships between these conditions and fecal coliforms are not fully understood. Furthermore, the sources of large variability in fecal coliform counts, e.g., temporal or spatial sources, remain unexplained, especially at large scales. This study proposes the use of Bayesian over dispersed Poisson models, whereby the combined effects of temperature, rainfall, and land-use characteristics on fecal coliform concentration are quantified with predictive uncertainty, and the sources of variability in fecal coliform concentration are assessed. The models were developed using 8-year weekly observations of fecal coliforms obtained from the Wachusett Reservoir watershed in Massachusetts, USA. The results highlight the importance of interactions among meteorological and land-use characteristics in controlling the instream fecal coliform concentration; the increase in fecal coliform concentration with temperature increase was more drastic when rainfall occurred. Also, the responses of fecal coliforms to temperature increases were more pronounced in forest-dominated than in urban-dominated areas. In contrast, the fecal coliform concentration increased more rapidly with rainfall increases in urban dominated than in forest-dominated areas. The models also demonstrate that among the sources of variability, the monthly component made the most significant contribution to the variability in fecal coliform concentrations. Our results suggest that seasonally dependent processes, including surface runoff, are critical factors that regulate fecal coliform concentration in streams. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The paper presents the development of a mathematical model and a simulation tool for the transient prediction of the indoor climate and the heat loads in a car cabin, under real operating conditions. The main objectives were to develop a tool which facilitates, for example, the design of a cabin HVAC system or an on-line control. The model is based on the energy balance between the cabin and the outdoor environment accounting for conduction, convection and shortwave and longwave radiation. Inside the car cabin, the heat exchange is calculated between the human body, the air zone, the interior cabin surfaces and the incoming air from the HVAC system. The heat balance model assumes a simplified 3D geometry of a cabin, which is specified by seven basic parameters. The model also allows simulating the incidence angle of the sun rays onto the individual parts of the exterior surface during parking as well as during a journey. The model was tested and evaluated for a Skoda Felicia Combi car in situations of summer parking and an autumn journey. Measured data were used both as boundary conditions for the model and as validation and calibration data. The air temperature inside the car cabin, predicted by the model, was in a very good agreement with the measured mean air temperature. The model is able to correctly predict the indoor cabin air temperature and the heat loads into the car cabin, thus it is well suited as a software support tool in the process of HVAC design and on-line cabin climate control.

AB  - The organic rich Safer shales exposed in the north-central part of onshore Marib-Shabowah Basin are evaluated and their depositional environments are interpreted. Total organic carbon contents (TOC) of the shales range from 1.02-16.8 wt%, and yield hydrogen index (HI) values ranging from 130 to 820 mg HC/g TOC, consistent with mainly Type II with minor contributions from Type I and mixed Types II-III kerogens. The Safer shale samples have vitrinite reflectance values in the range of 0.5-1.0 R-o%, indicating early mature to peak mature stage for oil generation. T-max values range from 429-438 degrees C, which are in reasonably good agreement with vitrinite reflectance data. Kerogen microscopy shows that the Safer shales are characterized by high amounts of organic matter, consisting predominantly of yellow fluorescing amorphous organic matter and alginite of marine origin. This is supported by their high content of hydrogen rich Type II and I oil-prone kerogen.
   The biomarker distributions of the Upper Jurassic Safer extracts are characterized by dominant low to medium molecular weight compounds (n-C-14 to n-C-20), low Pr/Ph ratio (<1.0), high phytane/n-C-18 ratios (0.82-2.68), and predominant regular sterane C-27. All biomarker parameters clearly indicate that the organic matter was derived from marine algal inputs and deposited under anoxic (reducing) conditions. Hypersaline conditions also prevailed during deposition of these sediments, as indicated by the presence of gammacerane. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Negative affect in humans and animals is known to cause individuals to interpret ambiguous stimuli pessimistically, a phenomenon termed 'cognitive bias'. Here, we used captive European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to test the hypothesis that a reduction in environmental conditions, from enriched to non-enriched cages, would engender negative affect, and hence 'pessimistic' biases. We also explored whether individual differences in stereotypic behaviour (repetitive somersaulting) predicted 'pessimism'. Eight birds were trained on a novel conditional discrimination task with differential rewards, in which background shade (light or dark) determined which of two covered dishes contained a food reward. The reward was small when the background was light, but large when the background was dark. We then presented background shades intermediate between those trained to assess the birds' bias to choose the dish associated with the smaller food reward (a 'pessimistic' judgement) when the discriminative stimulus was ambiguous. Contrary to predictions, changes in the level of cage enrichment had no effect on 'pessimism'. However, changes in the latency to choose and probability of expressing a choice suggested that birds learnt rapidly that trials with ambiguous stimuli were unreinforced. Individual differences in performance of stereotypies did predict 'pessimism'. Specifically, birds that somersaulted were more likely to choose the dish associated with the smaller food reward in the presence of the most ambiguous discriminative stimulus. We propose that somersaulting is part of a wider suite of behavioural traits indicative of a stress response to captive conditions that is symptomatic of a negative affective state.

AB  - Can lichen communities be used to assess short- and long-term factors affecting seral quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) communities at the landscape scale?
   Bear River Range, within the Rocky Mountains, in northern Utah and southern Idaho, USA.
   Forty-seven randomly selected mid-elevation aspen stands were sampled for lichens and stand conditions. Plots were characterized according to tree species cover, basal area, stand age, bole scarring, tree damage, and presence of lichen species. We also recorded ammonia emissions with passive sensors at 25 urban and agricultural sites throughout an adjacent populated valley upwind of the forest stands. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination was used to evaluate an array of 20 variables suspected to influence lichen communities.
   In NMS, forest succession explained most variance in lichen composition and abundance, although atmospheric nitrogen from local agricultural and urban sources also significantly influenced the lichen communities. Abundance of nitrophilous lichen species decreased with distance from peak ammonia sources and the urban center in all aspen succession classes. One lichen, Phaeophyscia nigricans, was found to be an effective bioindicator of nitrogen loading.
   Lichen communities in this landscape assessment of aspen forests showed clear responses to long-term (stand succession) and short-term (nitrogen deposition) influences. At the same time, several environmental factors (e.g. tree damage and scarring, distance to valley, topography, and stand age) had little influence on these same lichen communities. We recommend further use of epiphytic lichens as bioindicators of dynamic forest conditions.

AB  - Objective-To characterize and purify covalent complexes of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and haptoglobin released by bovine granulocytes in vitro.
   Sample Population-Blood samples obtained from healthy cows and cows with acute and chronic inflammation to obtain WBCs and sera.
   Procedures-WBCs were isolated by differential centrifugation, hypotonic lysis of RBCs, and degranulated by stimulation with phorbol ester (20 ng/mL). Cell-conditioned medium was subjected to affinity and gel chromatography and purified proteins subjected to SDS-PAGE gelatin zymography, western blot analysis, Coomassie blue staining, and peptide mass spectrometry for protein identification. Sera of cows hospitalized for acute and chronic septic conditions and of clinically normal cows were analyzed with similar methods.
   Results-Matrix metalloproteinase-9 was released from neutrophils in vitro and migrated to a molecular mass of approximately 220 kd (prodimer), approximately 105 kd (promonomer), and > 220 kd (high-molecular mass complexes). These high-molecular mass complexes were composed of alpha- and beta-haptoglobin and MMP-9 (ratio13:13:1). Complexes of MMP-9 and haptoglobin had biochemical properties of both its protein constituents (ie, enzymatic activity toward gelatin and hemoglobin binding). Complexes of MMP-9 and haptoglobin were also detected in sera of cows with acute inflammation, but not in clinically normal cows or cows with chronic disease.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-A fraction of neutrophil MMP-9 is released in complex with haptoglobin. The complex is present in granules and retains biological activity of its components. Detection of the complex in serum may provide an indicator of acute inflammation.

AB  - The basis of this work was to investigate the relative environmental impacts of various power generators knowing that all plants are located in totally different environments and that different receptors will experience different impacts. Based on IChemE sustainability metrics paradigm, we calculated potential environmental indicators (P-EI) that represent the environmental burden of masses of potential pollutants discharged into different receiving media. However, a P-EI may not be of significance, as it may not be expressed at all in different conditions, so to try and include some receiver significance we developed a methodology to take into account some specific environmental indicators (S-EI) that refer to the environmental attributes of a specific site. In this context, we acquired site specific environmental data related to the airsheds and water catchment areas in different locations for a limited number of environmental indicators such as human health (carcinogenic) effects, atmospheric acidification, photochemical (ozone) smog and eutrophication. The S-EI results from this particular analysis show that atmospheric acidification has highest impact value while health risks due to fly ash emissions are considered not to be as significant. This is due to the fact that many coal power plants in Australia are located in low population density air sheds. The contribution of coal power plants to photochemical (ozone) smog and eutrophication were not significant. In this study, we have considered emission related data trends to reflect technology performance (e.g., P-EI indicators) while a real sustainability metric can be associated only with the specific environmental conditions of the relevant sites (e.g., S-EI indicators).

AB  - Chironomid subfossil assemblages from six low-alpine and sub-alpine Holocene stratigraphies are presented and compared. They are from five lakes in mid-southern and western Norway and one in central Sweden. When comparing the chironomid-inferred July air temperatures, there are many time segments with a poor among-lake fit in inferred temperatures. Possible environmental variables influencing the fossil chironomid assemblages are discussed using a modern Norwegian calibration data set to indicate taxon-environment relationships. These analyses indicate that local changes in pH, water chemistry, and productivity at times may have overridden the regional temperature signal. In addition, other causes of poor among-site temperature fit are discussed, in particular those related to chronological uncertainties. Holocene temperature inferences from single cores based on chironomids may not always be able to provide a reliable regional temperature signal, but can act as a guide from which hypotheses about past environmental conditions can be tested with the aid of chironomid-inferred temperatures from several sites and from other environmental proxies. We have obtained a regional picture of Holocene summer temperature change by developing a consensus reconstruction based on the overall temperature signal from all six sites. This consensus is developed by fitting a smoother through all 330 site-specific temperature-deviations from the Holocene mean. The consensus temperature deviations vary from -0.8 degrees C at 8800 cal years BP to +0.8 degrees C at 6500 cal years BP. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pig liver is a possible source of hepatocytes for extracorporeal bio-artificial liver devices. In order to evaluate recovered hepatocyte function following enzymatic isolation, we developed a cytochemical method that is based on the capacity of hepatocytes to sequester the anthracycline antitumour drug doxorubicin within intracellular acidic compartments. Doxorubicin is a naturally fluorescent molecule. Thus, the process of drug concentration within hepatocytes can be visualized in living conditions by fluorescence microscopy. Porcine hepatocytes harvested from heart-beating donors were grown either as isolated cell suspensions or as tissue monolayers. Immediately after isolation and at fixed culture times, cells were incubated with 0.1 mM doxorubicin in Hanks' balanced salt solution for 10 min at 37 degreesC in 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Parallel electron microscopy was performed to compare fluorescence data with general cell morphology. To monitor lysosomal acidification capacity, the fluorescent pH-sensitive vital dye LysoSensor-Blue was used. Doxorubicin fluorescence showed different patterns of nuclear and cytoplasmic staining, according to the time allowed for cell recovery and the culture method. In particular, cytoplasmic fluorescence changed from a diffuse staining, that could be observed after cell isolation and in hepatocyte suspensions, to a punctate perinuclear and pericanalicular fluorescence detectable in fully recovered hepatocyte monolayers. This study indicates that the 'doxorubicin-fluorescence test' may be considered a simple and rapid procedure for assessing hepatocyte functional condition. It may provide valuable and 'real time' guidelines for judging the correct way these cells are to be collected, preserved and utilized for clinical purposes.

AB  - Cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition has been demonstrated to be useful as a biomarker for exposure to organophosphorus (OP) and carbamate insecticides in many environments; however, there are questions about whether ChE activity may be affected by common environmental conditions such as low oxygen concentrations or by concurrent exposure to multiple chemicals. This article describes experiments in which larvae of Chironomus riparius were exposed to hypoxia (dissolved oxygen concentrations of 0.1 mg L-1; < 1% saturation) in wetland mesocosms and in the laboratory (1.90 mg l(-1); 19% saturation), and in which C. riparius larvae were exposed to mixtures of the OP, chlorpyrifos and the herbicides, atrazine and metolachlor, in hypoxic wetland mesocosms and in normoxic conditions in the laboratory. Larvae exposed to hypoxia for up to 35 h had no change in ChE activity, nor did atrazine or metolachlor cause ChE inhibition. There was no significant difference in ChE inhibition between larvae exposed to a mixture of chlorpyrifos (0.5 mu g l(-1)), atrazine and metolachlor and larvae exposed to chlorpyrifos (0.5 mu g l(-1)) alone. Larval chironomids are good candidates for monitoring of ChE inhibitors in shallow aquatic systems. Chironomid larvae are easy to handle and can be caged in areas where pesticide inflow is a concern. Chironomids can be placed in hypoxic aquatic systems as they are able to tolerate hypoxia for several hours up to a few days. Finally, in this study, larval ChE activities were significantly depressed following a range of exposures to chlorpyrifos, indicating that chironomid ChE activities are a sensitive indicator of exposure to OPs.

AB  - 1. We used catchment and reach-scale physical properties to predict the occurrence of specific species life history and behaviour traits of aquatic insects across fifty-eight catchments in a mixed land use basin. Catchment-scale attributes were derived using a geographical information system (GIS). Logistic regression techniques were used to model the relationships.
   2. The reach-scale properties were highly predictive of species traits. Fourteen of the fifteen traits had significant models with concordance values greater than 68%. Cross-sectional area at bank full discharge, % shallow, slow-water habitats, and % fines were the most important variables.
   3. Life history and behavioural attributes were best related to reach-scale physical features. This suggests that species traits exhibit strong relationships to local environmental conditions.
   4. Catchment-scale variables had fewer significant models with species traits (four of fifteen), however these variables may have direct or indirect influence on reach-scale properties.
   5. Catchment features, in particular surficial geology, influence macroinvertebrate assemblages through their control over channel morphology and hydrologic patterns.
   6. The effects of land use were masked by geology (i.e. lacustrine clay geology and rowcrop agriculture were correlated), lack of detail in land use data and the aggregation of the species data.
   7. These models reflect the coupling of local environmental conditions and the set of adaptations among the local taxa. These observations underscore the idea that habitat plays a major role in organizing stream assemblages.
   8. Using these approaches, predictions can be made about the ability of various taxonomic groupings to track environmental change through time, or for projecting the impact of alternative land management scenarios. Identifying fundamental life history and other traits can improve the selection and evaluation of such indicators.

AB  - Energy budgets of juvenile pike and perch (weighing approximately 3 g) were determined in experiments lasting up to 4 days, by simultaneously measuring oxygen consumption, food consumption, and growth of individual fish.  Although the basic pattern of energy allocation was identical in the two species, perch subjected to constant light (PEL) showed faster growth, higher assimilation and conversion efficiency, and higher oxygen consumption than perch subjected to a short daylength regime (PED).  The efficiency with which food energy was converted into body mass was 39 +/- 5% in PED but 49 +/- 4% in PEL.  However, the "work coefficient" (increment of body mass/post-prandial increase of oxygen consumption:  mg.mu-mol O2(-1)) differed only insignificantly between the two groups of perch, indicating that the metabolic cost of growth was unaffected by the manipulation of experimental conditions.  This identifies the higher assimilation efficiency, i.e. the increased flow of food energy into the tissues as being the cause of accelerated growth of perch under the constant-light regime.  In both species the maximum feeding-induced metabolic rate was 4 times higher than the lowest preprandial rate.  In perch (which were kept on low rations before the experiments) the post-prandial metabolic rate increased steadily from day to day during the 4-day experiments, so that on the last day the rate of oxygen consumption exceeded the rate on the first day by about 41%.  This investigation provides further evidence that the allocation of metabolic energy in fish is based on a flexible strategy which responds sensitively to changes in both internal and external conditions.

AB  - Temporal changes of the morphological indices (Relative Gut Length (RGL), Fullness Index (FI), Hepatosomatic Index (HSI), Visceral Index (VSI), Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) and Fulton condition)) in 122 (female: 94, male: 19, immature: 9) common sole were evaluated. Total length-weight relationships were calculated as W = 0.085TL(3.01) and W = 0.0547TL(2.40) in females and males, respectively, whereby isometric growth was observed in females and negative allometric growth was observed in males. While there was no statistically significant difference was observed between the FI, HSI, Viscerosomatic Index (VSI), RGL and GSI values of both sexes, however, there was a statistically significant difference in terms of Fulton K values (P < 0.05). In addition, there are statistical differences between the sexes total lengths and the values of RGL, FI, HSI, VSI, and Fulton-K (P < 0.05), as it is discernible in their HSI and VSI index values according to the month the specimens were obtained (P < 0.05). According to the results of the analysis, it has been determined that the female common sole along the Aegean coast adjust their energy temporally and store the energy they obtain from vegetative and carnivorous feeding. Contrary to the situation seen in females, the male individuals invest in energy through omnivorous feeding, according to the diet in the active process. Based on the results, it can be stated that the VSI and HSI are both important indicators of fish condition status. The results found here may be useful in both fishery research and fishery management.

AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass processing to produce platform chemicals and biofuels is a promising alternative utilization of non-renewable resources. This study investigated the techno-economics of two-stage and one-stage furfural production integrated with ethanol co-production from sugarcane bagasse and harvest residues. The effect of process conditions on profitability was reflected by the minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) at a fixed furfural-selling price. Aspen Plus V8.8 was used to simulate the integrated two-stage furfural and ethanol co-production biorefineries using low (scenario 1), medium (scenario 2) and high (scenario 3) severity steam-explosion pretreatment. The two-stage furfural biorefineries integrated with ethanol co-production were compared with the most profitable one-stage furfural biorefinery integrated with ethanol co-production. The required MESP in scenario 2 (0.73 US$ L-1) was decreased by 36% compared with the one-stage furfural-ethanol biorefinery (1.14 US$ L-1). Scenarios 1 and 3 were disadvantaged by lower ethanol yields (150 versus 214 kg t(-1) of feed) and higher capital investments (322-340) compared with scenario 2 (310 million US$). The one-stage furfural production had higher heating demands (2034 versus 741-1124 kW t(-1) feed) and reduced ethanol yields (90 versus 150-214 kg t(-1) of feed) compared with integrated two-stage furfural and ethanol coproduction biorefineries. Optimization of process conditions, improving energy efficiency, and maximizing productivity within these energy self-sufficient facilities were critical to minimizing the MESPs, regardless of associated increases in capital and operational costs.

AB  - Mining and biomass waste were used to remediate a brownfield affected by As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn pollution in a pilot scale experiment, and a plant used for phytoremediation purposes was used as an indicator of possible toxicological effects. To carry out the experiments, plots in field conditions were treated with magnesite (mining waste), magnesite-sludge compost, and magnesite-biochar respectively, while untreated soil was used as a control. The plots were then irrigated and left for one week, after which seeds of the ryegrass Lolium perenne L. were sown. Soil properties such as metal(loid) availability, pH, phosphorus availability, total nitrogen, organic carbon, and nutrients were monitored for two months. Finally, the ryegrass was harvested and pollutant concentrations were analyzed in the aerial parts. Magnesite proved to be an excellent amendment for metal(loid) immobilization, although the notable increase in soil pH and Mg content inhibited plant growth. However, the application of magnesite in combination with the sludge compost (rich in N and P) favored plant growth and also immobilized metals, although As availability increased. In contrast, the analysis of plants in this treatment revealed lower As and metal concentrations than those grown in the untreated soil. In turn, the application of magnesite and biochar was also effective in reducing metal(loid) availability; however, the plants did not grow under these conditions, probably due to the low N and P content of biochar. In this regard, the combined application of mining waste and sludge compost emerges as a useful nature-based solution for soil remediation in the context of the circular economy.

AB  - Water stress or soil salinity is considered the major environmental factor affecting plant growth. When both challenges are present, the soil becomes infertile, limiting plant productivity. In this work a field experiment was conducted during the summer 2019 and 2020 seasons to evaluate whether plant growth-promoting microbes (PGPMs) and nanoparticles (Si-ZnNPs) have the potential to maintain soybean growth, productivity, and seed quality under different watering intervals (every 11 (IW0), 15 (IW1) and 19 (IW2) days) in salt-affected soil. The most extended watering intervals (IW1 and IW2) caused significant increases in Na+ content, and oxidative damage indicators (malondialdehyde (MDA) and electrolyte leakage (EL%)), which led to significant reductions in soybean relative water content (RWC), stomatal conductance, leaf K+, photosynthetic pigments, soluble protein. Subsequently reduced the vegetative growth (root length, nodules dry weight, and total leaves area) and seeds yield. However, there was an enhancement in the antioxidants defense system (enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant). The individual application of PGPMs or Si-ZnNPs significantly improved leaf K+ content, photosynthetic pigments, RWC, stomatal conductance, total soluble sugars (TSS), CAT, POD, SOD, number of pods plant 1, and seed yield through decreasing the leaf Na+ content, MDA, and EL%. The combined application of PGPMs and Si-ZnNPs minimized the adverse impact of water stress and soil salinity by maximizing the root length, heavier nodules dry weight, leaves area, TSS and the activity of antioxidant enzymes, which resulted in higher soybean growth and productivity, which suggests their use under harsh growing conditions.

AB  - The Siberian mammoth steppe ecosystem changed dramatically with the disappearance of large grazers in the Holocene. The concept of Pleistocene rewilding is based on the idea that large herbivore grazing significantly alters plant communities and can be employed to recreate lost ecosystems. On the other hand, modern rangeland ecology emphasizes the often overriding importance of harsh climates. We visited two rewilding projects and three rangeland regions, sampling a total of 210 vegetation releves in steppe and surrounding vegetation (grasslands, shrublands and forests) along an extensive climatic gradient across Yakutia, Russia. We analyzed species composition, plant traits, diversity indices and vegetation productivity, using partial canonical correspondence and redundancy analysis. Macroclimate was most important for vegetation composition, and microclimate for the occurrence of extrazonal steppes. Macroclimate and soil conditions mainly determined productivity of vegetation. Bison grazing was responsible for small-scale changes in vegetation through trampling, wallowing and debarking, thus creating more open and disturbed plant communities, soil compaction and xerophytization. However, the magnitude of effects depended on density and type of grazers as well as on interactions with climate and site conditions. Effects of bison grazing were strongest in the continental climate of Central Yakutia, and steppes were generally less affected than meadows. We conclude that contemporary grazing overall has rather limited effects on vegetation in northeastern Siberia. Current rewilding practices are still far from recreating a mammoth steppe, although large herbivores like bison can create more open and drier vegetation and increase nutrient availability in particular in the more continental Central Yakutian Plain.

AB  - The issues related to the assessment of the hydro morphological status of urban rivers in order to identify the revitalisation actions possible to be carried out, has been acquiring significant importance in recent years. The revitalisation of urban rivers and the waterfront urban space must be preceded by an assessment and determination of the direction of revitalisation measures necessary to be implemented. Most of the methods used worldwide to assess the hydro morphological condition of the river do not include the element of planning revitalization activities. Meanwhile, there is a close relationship between the morphological conditions of the river and its corridor, and the range of necessary and feasible activities aimed at recreating some of the natural features of the river, with the simultaneous increase in the possibility of using the adjacent area as a safe public space. The existing methods used to identify places where revitalisation works are possible, omit many morphological elements of the rivers under analysis. This makes impossible to monitor their morphological status later and assess the effectiveness of the implemented works. The paper presents the results of the Unified Stream Assessment (USA) method of the urban river Klodnica, located in Upper Silesia, which is the area with the largest degree of urbanisation and industrialisation in Poland. The conducted assessment allowed to determine possible revitalization activities, indicated significant limitations as well as the need to modify the USA method. Results of the study revealed that proposed revitalisation actions based on the USA assessment should take into account the nature of the whole watershed and not just river corridor. The modification of USA method results proper development of urban river assessment and revitalisation process.

AB  - Flooding and water logging possess severe hazards to human population in many parts of the world. Mumbai, the study area, is one of the cities in India and has been frequently affected by floods and landslides causing heavy loss of life and property. Enormous concretization and 150-year-old storm water drainage system of Mumbai have led to water logging and flood-like conditions which leads to natural hazard. The objective of this study is to identify the flood and landslide spots and to prepare the map by using GIS software. The study also consists of comparing potential of QGIS and Arc-GIS software in the form of data analysis and thematic map creation. From this study, it is clear that large-scale reshaping took place to complete the reclamation project which makes all those areas prone to various hazards. In assessment of flood and landslide spots, many significant points were revealed: the average elevation of Mumbai is 14 m, and also majority of the flood spots have an elevation range between 5 and 14 m. The analysis of the database generated in QGIS software also revealed that significant numbers of flood spots are mostly found in the reclamation zone and the landslide spots near base of hill. This study indicates that the current situation may trigger disastrous conditions in the future which need intervention from government bodies, institutions and NGOs to prepare proper disaster management plans to help mitigate this situation. To mitigate the problem of water logging, it is required to drain off the water into the ground. Pervious concrete is the best solution for it but for its implementation detailed database of the waterlogged area is required.

AB  - This study investigated the biodiversity and hydrochemistry of seven unconfined aquifers located in two hydrogeological complexes in the north-western region of Algeria. The aim of the study was to: (1) contribute new data on the biodiversity and distribution patterns of groundwater fauna in groundwater bodies in North Africa, (2) assess whether the current biodiversity patterns of groundwater taxa reflect the difference in aquifer type, hydrogeological conditions and hydrochemistry, and (3) evaluate the role of hydrogeological, geographical and physicochemical variables in determining the distribution pattern of groundwater invertebrates. Sixty-three wells were investigated between August 2010 and June 2013. In total, 41,297 specimens belonging to 51 taxa, 10 of which were crustaceans, were collected during the survey. Taxa abundances varied significantly between aquifer types, but not between the two hydrogeological complexes (continental and littoral). The groundwater assemblages collected in seven aquifers in northwest Algeria differed significantly between aquifer types in this region. The distribution of groundwater fauna across the whole study area was primarily affected by distance to streams, the geological period and electrical conductivity. Overall, the assemblages showed a spatial distribution that to some extent mirrored the hydrogeological and hydrochemical conditions of groundwater in the north-western part of Algeria. These findings suggest that groundwater biota, and crustaceans in particular, may play a key role in distinguishing between the typologies of the investigated aquifers. This study contributes to knowledge of current groundwater biodiversity in northwest Algeria and demonstrates that this knowledge is still far from being complete.

AB  - Current technologies of thermal and flame liquid treatment involve high energy consumption, repeated supply of untreated liquid to the chamber, long-term heating and additive evaporation, hence quite low efficiency. These aspects are the main reason why high-temperature evaporation and burnout of impurities has limited technological implementation. The efficiency of such technologies may be improved by means of explosive breakup of untreated droplets in heating chambers. As a result, one parent droplet breaks up to form several dozens to several hundreds of the so-called child-droplets. The development of such technologies requires fundamental understanding of heating, evaporation, boiling, and explosive breakup of one-, two-, and multi-component droplets. The same processes can be used to improve the environmental and energy performance indicators of burning liquid, emulsion, and slurry fuels in combustion chambers of power plants and internal combustion engines. In this paper, we present the experimental research into the main heat and mass transfer processes occurring during the heating, evaporation, boiling, and explosive breakup of two- and multi-component droplets in a heated air flow. We identify the principal differences of two dispersion behaviors - puffing and micro-explosion - and indicate the conditions, in which this or that behavior dominates. There is also a transient parameter domain, in which both behaviors can occur. The curves are plotted showing droplet heating times until explosive breakup versus temperature, component concentration, and droplet radii. Finally, we single out the conditions for fragmentation and atomization of two-, three-, and multi-component droplets. (C) 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Even though perception varies with agro-ecology and socioeconomic situation of the farming community, there are insufficient reports about farmers' perception on land degradation in the semiarid area conditions. The objectives of this study were to examine farmers' characteristics from the view of land degradation, explore farmers' perception on causes and indicators of land degradation, and analyze the determinants of farmers' perception on land degradation in Dura sub-catchment, northern Ethiopia. Transect-walks, group discussions and semi-structured questionnaire interviews were used. Data were subjected to descriptive, chi-square (chi(2)) and binary logistic regression analysis. This study showed that there was significant variability in the socioeconomic, farm, biophysical and institutional factors among farmers' that led to have different views on land degradation. The farmers' participated during the walks identified low, medium and high degradation classes. Significantly higher proportions of respondents perceived that deforestation (100%), followed by overgrazing (98%) and improper soil management (97%) are the main direct causes of degradation; whereas poverty (100%) followed by population pressure (98%) are the most commonly identified indirect causes of land degradation. The most frequently used indicators of degradation by farmers are soil depth (100%), soil erosion (95%) and soil fertility (95%). The respondents' perception on land degradation trend varied significantly by slope steepness. The logistic regression model result indicated that farm and biophysical explanatory variables showed the highest likelihood for farmers' to perceive land degradation. Attention should be given to such factors while formulation promising landscape management strategy that considers suitability and adaptability to local conditions.

AB  - Soil salinity is one of the main factors limiting cereal productivity in worldwide agriculture. Exploitation of natural variation in local barley germplasm is an effective approach to overcome yield losses. Three gene pools of North African Hordeum vulgare L. grown in Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt were evaluated at the reproductive stage under control and saline conditions. Assessment of stress tolerance was monitored using morphological, yield-related traits and phenological parameters of reproductive organs showing significant genetic variation. High heritability and positive relationships were found suggesting that some traits associated with salt tolerance could be used as selection criteria. The phenotypic correlations revealed that vegetative traits including shoot biomass, tiller number and leaf number along with yield-related traits such as spike number, one spike dry weight, grain number/plant and grain number/spike were highly positively correlated with grain yield under saline conditions. Hence, these traits can be used as reliable selection criteria to improve barley grain yield. Keeping a higher shoot biomass and longer heading and maturity periods as well as privileged filling ability might contribute to higher grain production in barley and thus could be potential target traits in barley crop breeding toward improvement of salinity tolerance. Multiple selection indices revealed that salt tolerance trait index provided a better discrimination of barley landraces allowing selection of highly salt-tolerant and highly productive genotypes under severe salinity level. Effective evaluation of salt tolerance requires an integration of selection indices to successfully identify and characterize salt tolerant lines required for valuable exploitation in the management of salt-affected areas.

AB  - The community-based climate change adaptation plan of action (CAPA) ensures a bottom-up planning process to minimize climate impacts on the livelihood of vulnerable people and provides adaptation actions for increasing resilience capacity in Nepal. This paper mainly examines the role of participatory tools and techniques with the potential to identify the level of vulnerability and likely adaptation measures to increase the forest resilience capacities of communities where CAPA has been prepared (i.e. CAPA group). In total, 13 participatory qualitative tools were evaluated against 15 criteria for identifying their performance in nine CAPA groups representing three geo-graphical regions of Nepal. Multivariate analyses of the participatory tools and their performance allowed for selecting the most similar and dissimilar CAPA groups. The results indicated how CAPA groups are evaluating the likelihood of climate change impact, determining the vulnerability of specific ecosystem services and understanding the possible local adaptation measures. Many methods do not offer conditions for exploiting new innovative opportunities, assessing scenarios or identifying ecosystem services in the CAPA process. Tools are required that consider qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods, measure vulnerability and ecosystem functions and services. Although many issues related to local conditions and vulnerabilities have not been tapped adequately, it is difficult to generalize individual case study results within the different geographical contexts of Nepal. The integration of adaptation planning in local institutions, in order to deal with different ecosystem-based adaptation options, along with identification of climate change scenarios, impacts, trade-offs, synergies and the sensitivity of management problems, is highly recommended.

AB  - This paper investigates recent sedimentation processes and geochemistry of sedimentary organic matter (SOM) and trace elements in a unique semi-enclosed lacustrine sedimentation system in a transitional land-sea environment of the Neretva River delta. The results have shown that the influence of the Neretva River on the lake sedimentation processes is limited to short-term flood events carrying terrigenous loads, while the authigenic formation of nanostructured calcite is the primary source of sediments in the recent past. The enhanced release of biogenic CO2 into the pore water, deriving from the decomposition of SOM, acts as a major contributor to this process. The occurrence of early formed syngenetic and diagenetic pyrite indicates the existence of oxygen-depleted conditions in the investigated system in the recent past. The input of terrigenous material was identified as the main source of trace elements (Pb, Cu, Zn, Sn) in the lake sediments. The distribution of redox sensitive elements (Mo, Tl, V) particularly depends on the oxygen deficiency and the formation of sedimentary pyrite. The human impact in the study area is negligible, although somewhat elevated concentrations of Sn were found in the surface sediment layers. Finally, the results obtained indicate that the Kuti Lake represents a unique lacustrine environment which can be viewed as an isolated sedimentological and biogeochemical system in the Neretva River delta.

AB  - Dual pH-dependent fluorescence peaks from a semiconductor quantum dot (QD) and a pH-dependent fluorescent dye can be measured by irradiating with a single wavelength light, and the pH can be estimated from the ratio of the fluorescent intensity of the two peaks. In this work, ratiometric pH sensing was achieved in an aqueous environment by a fluorescent CdSe/ZnS QD appended with a pH-sensitive organic dye, based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). By functionalizing the CdSe/ZnS QD with 5-(and 6)-carboxynaphthofluorescein succinimidyl ester as a pH-dependent fluorescent dye, we succeeded in fabricating sensitive nanocomplexes with a linear response to a broad range of physiological pH levels (7.5 - 9.5) when excited at 450 rim. We found that a purification process is important for increasing the high-fluorescence intensity ratio of a ratiometric fluorescence pH-sensor, and the fluorescence intensity ratio was improved up to 1.0 at pH 8.0 after the purification process to remove unreacted CdSe/ZnS QDs even though the fluorescence of the dye could not be observed without the purification process. The fluorescence intensity ratio corresponds to the fluorescence intensity of the dye, and this fluorescent dye exhibited pH-dependent fluorescence intensity changes. These facts indicate that the fluorescence intensity ratio linearly increased with increasing pH value of the buffer solution containing the QD and the dye. The FRET efficiencies changed from 0.3 (pH 7.5) to 6.2 (pH 9.5).

AB  - Scattered trees in agricultural landscapes are globally declining due to the intensification of agricultural practices. Dehesas, highly species-diverse Mediterranean open woodlands, are seriously affected by this decline, because of a generalized regeneration failure of oak, which compromise their long-term stability. Traditionally, dehesas were the wintering areas for transhumant herds, but transhumance is disappearing in the Mediterranean, due to multiple causes. Reductions in grazing intensity or grazing abandonment have been proposed to improve oak regeneration in dehesas, but the effect of the recovery of non-continuous grazing practices such as transhumance has not been tested to date. We measured different indicators of holm oak regeneration and condition in dehesas under transhumant grazing and in dehesas under permanent grazing in southern Spain. Oak juveniles were remarkably less browsed and their canopies covered a much higher area in transhumant estates. As a consequence, the median density of saplings was more than four times higher in transhumant than in permanently-grazed estates. Although transhumant grazing is necessarily associated with a reduction in the stocking rate across the year, the timing of grazing was always included as a predictor in the best models to explain the condition and density of holm oak. Our results suggest that the lack of oak regeneration in dehesas can be caused not only by the increases in stocking rates, but also by the recent abandonment of traditional grazing practices like transhumance. We propose the recovery of seasonal grazing regimes based on transhumant pastoralism as a measure to improve the conservation status of dehesas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents research carried out into the disinfectant power of a series of treatments based on the individual application and possible combinations of TiO2 (1 g/L), H2O2 (0.04 mM) and irradiation (290-800 nm and 320-800 nm) on Enterococcus sp., a faecal bacterial indicator used in water analysis. The main aims are the determination of the influence of the UVB range on the inactivation of Enterococcus sp. in natural water, the mode of application of irradiation (intermittent or continuous) and the capacity of bacterial recovery after the application of the treatments in darkness conditions. The results show that when the irradiation includes the UVB range, a very high degree of inactivation is obtained in an Enterococcus sp. solution in natural water (N-0 = 10(8) CFU 100 mL(-1)) by irradiation alone. Neither the addition of TiO2 nor of H2O2 are very relevant in these conditions. However, if the irradiation does not include the UVB range, the bactericidal action of photolysis is practically nonexistent, highlighting the positive effect of TiO2 and H2O2, on the irradiation, the photocatalysis and photocatalysis/H2O2 treatments obtaining a higher degree of disinfection. Continuous and intermittent illumination give rise to similar inactivation levels in all the treatments studied, except for photolysis in which a significant increase in inactivation is observed when the irradiation is continuous. During 3 h of darkness following application of the treatments, there is no change or else a slight recovery of the bacterial population. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Continuous exposure of cattle to summer heat in the absence of shade results in significant hyperthermia and impairs growth and general health. Reliable predictors of heat strain are needed to identify this condition. A 12-day study was conducted during a moderate summer heat period using 12 Angus x Simmental (Bos taurus) steers (533 +/- 12 kg average body weight) to identify animal and ambient determinations of core body temperature (T (core)) and respiration rate (RR) responses to heat stress. Steers were provided standard diet and water ad libitum, and implanted intraperitoneally with telemetric transmitters to monitor T (core) hourly. Visual count of flank movement at 0800 and 1500 hours was used for RR. Dataloggers recorded air temperature (T (a)), and black globe temperatures (T (bg)) hourly to assess radiant heat load. Analysis was across four periods and 2 consecutive days averaged within each period. Average T (a) and T (bg) increased progressively from 21.7 to 30.3A degrees C and 25.3 to 34.0A degrees C, respectively, from the first to fourth periods. A model utilizing a quadratic function of T (a) explained the most variation in T (core) (R (2) = 0.56). A delay in response from 1 to 3 h did not significantly improve R (2) for this relationship. Measurements at 0800 and 1500 hours alone are sufficient to predict heat strain. Daily minimum core body temperature and initial 2-h rise in T (a) were predictors of maximum core temperature and RR. Further studies using continuous monitoring are needed to expand prediction of heat stress impact under different conditions.

AB  - Seagrass meadows across north-eastern Australia, survive a range of environmental conditions in coastal bays, reefs, estuarine and deepwater habitats through adaptation of a range of structural, morphological and physiological features. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of spatial features (habitat type, site and depth) and photon flux on the photosynthetic performance of 11 tropical seagrass species. Pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry was used to generate rapid light curves from which measures of maximal electron transport rate (ETRmax), photosynthetic efficiency (alpha), saturating irradiance (E-k) and effective quantum yield (Delta F/F-m') were derived. The amount of light absorbed by leaves (absorption factor) was also determined for each population. In intertidal habitats many seagrass species exhibited typical sun-type responses with a close coupling of both ETRmax and E-k with photon flux. Photosynthetic performance ranged from minima in Thalassodendron ciliatum to maxima in Syringodium isoetifolium. The absence of a coupling between photosynthetic performance and photon flux in subtidal populations was most likely due to highly variable light climates and possible light attenuation, and hence the photo-biology of estuarine and deepwater seagrasses exhibited photosynthetic responses indicative of light limitation. In contrast seagrass species from shallow reef and coastal habitats for the most part exhibited light saturation characteristics. Of all the variables examined ETRmax, E-k and Delta F/F-m' were most responsive to changing light climates and provide reliable physiological indicators of real-time photosynthetic performance of tropical seagrasses under different light conditions.

AB  - The health of and and semiarid lands needs to be monitored, particularly if they are used to produce food and fiber, and are prone to loss of vegetation cover and soil. Indicators of landscape health based on remotely sensed data could cost-effectively integrate structural and functional attributes of land surfaces across a range of scales. In this paper, we describe a new index for remotely monitoring changes in the health of land. The new index takes important aspects of landscape structure and function into account by focusing on the potential for landscapes to lose or 'leak' (not retain) soil sediments. We combined remotely sensed vegetation patchiness data with digital elevation model (DEM) data to derive a quantitative metric, the landscape leakiness index, LI. This index is strongly linked to landscape function by algorithms that reflect the way in which spatial configuration of vegetation cover and terrain affect soil loss. Linking LI to landscape function is an improvement on existing indicators that are based on qualitatively assessing remotely sensed changes in vegetation cover. Using archived Landsat imagery and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEMs, we found for example that LI indicated improvements in the condition or health of a rangeland paddock that was monitored from 1980 to 2002. This paddock is located in central Australia and its improved health is documented by photographs and field data. Although the full applicability of LI remains to be explored, we have demonstrated that it has the potential to serve as a useful ecological indicator for monitoring the health of and and semiarid landscapes.

AB  - Seventy-two doubled haploid (DH) barley lines and their two parents 'Steptoe' and 'Morex' were planted in a randomized complete block design with three replications at the research farm of the University of Tehran, Faculty of Agriculture, Karaj, Iran, for two growing seasons. Each plot consisted of a 2 m row and was scored for 10 agronomic traits. Analysis of variance showed that the main effects of genotype and environment (year) were significant for all studied traits. Genotype by environment interaction was also significant for all the traits except for plant height and seed/spike. Heritability estimates were more than 0.6 for all of the traits. A genetic map comprising 327 molecular markers was recovered from Grain Gene and used for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. This map is fairly saturated with a total length of 1226 cM and an average marker spacing of 3.75 cM. Twenty-three QTLs controlling different studied traits were identified. Phenotypic variance explained by these QTLs varies from 11.9 to 61.1%. QTLs were identified for all traits on all chromosomes except chromosome 6H. Highest LOD scores were obtained for the dates of spike initiation and flowering on chromosome 2H, and for plant height and spike length on chromosome 3H. QTLs for 1000-seed weight, an indicator of drought tolerance, were found on chromosomes 1H and 5H, with positive alleles from `Morex', and on chromosome 7H with positive alleles from `Steptoe'. The specificity of the QTLs for Iranian conditions as well as their usefulness for marker-assisted selection in dry conditions is discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To predict the persistency of a chemical in the environment, the chemical's physical-chemical properties and its reactivity in the environment need to be known or at least estimated. The partitioning of a chemical can be described on the basis of its water solubility, its octanol/water partitioning coefficient, and its vapor pressure. The mechanisms by which a chemical can be transformed may be categorized as being hydrolysis, oxidation, reduction, and photolysis. This study establishes a method for estimating the relative susceptibility of some potential environmental pollutants to undergo hydrolysis reactions. The method used the second-order rate constant for the reaction with sodium methoxide in methanol/N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as an indicator of relative susceptibility toward hydrolysis. The decabromodiphenyl ether is rapidly hydrolyzed, that is, undergoes nucleophilic aromatic substitution, while the rate of reaction of less brominated diphenyl ethers decreased by roughly a factor of 10 for each decrease in the level of bromination. Hexachlorobenzene was found to have a similar rate to a nonabromodiphenyl ether. 2,2-Bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (DDT) was transformed to 2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethene (DDE) immediately under these conditions, while DDE showed no apparent reaction. The results show that chemicals that can undergo elimination reactions are rapidly transformed, as are perhalogenated chemicals that can undergo substitution reactions. These chemicals are not likely to persist in the environment, while those that did not show any observable reactivity under similar hydrolytic conditions may persist for a very long time.

AB  - The article represents a link between the concept of discrete description of the ontogenesis of plants and the cellular automata approach for the spatial-temporal modelling of plant population dynamics. The continuous process of individual plant development may be subdivided into several stages on the basis of morphological indicators reflecting functional importance of plants at different stages. The number and duration of age stages may vary from species to species, among life-forms within species, and under different environment conditions. The duration of age stages and the probability of transition from one stage to another for a given plant depend on the plant's neighbourhood pattern, the type of ontogenesis and the site conditions. Such data are available from numerous field studies.
   The presented approach allows simulation of a plant population as a set of cellular automata located on a plane. The age stages of these automata can be changed according to simple rules, which reflect the types of plant ontogenesis, different life spans of age states, and different sizes of plants in the neighbourhood. This approach is different from matrix models, which are usually used for this purpose, in that here we can directly simulate the role of space interactions in the population dynamics. We constructed some cellular automata models based on experimental data, which reflect the ontogenesis types and life-forms of plants. The models demonstrate that simple rules of plant development with simply defined local interactions lead to complicated dynamics. The results show new possibilities of applications of discrete simulation modelling for analysis of plant populations and community dynamics. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The vocalizations of cattle provide conspecifics with meaningful information about the caller. If we can learn how to interpret this information correctly, it could be used to improve management and welfare assessment. Vocalization may be viewed as a subjective commentary, by an individual, on its own internal state. The vocal behaviour of cattle is potentially a useful indicator of their physiological and psychological functioning.
   In the first part of this article we ask what information is exchanged using auditory cues. Vocalizations provide information on the age, sex, dominance status and reproductive status of the caller. Calves can recognize their mothers using vocal cues but it is not clear whether cows recognize their offspring in this way. Vocal behaviour may play a role in estrus advertisement and competitive display by bulls. Under experimental conditions involving pain or social isolation, vocal response is useful as an indicator of welfare, if properly used. Unlike commonly used physiological measures, it can be recorded non-invasively and varies on a number of quantitative and qualitative dimensions.
   In the second part we review methodological approaches to the study of vocal behaviour and their application in cattle welfare research. Methods may focus on the actions of the vocalizing animal and the conditions which elicit vocal behaviour, the response of an animal to hearing another's vocalizations, or interactions between sender and receiver.
   We argue that vocal behaviour in cattle may be valuable in welfare studies if the endogenous, exogenous and developmental factors influencing its expression can be more thoroughly investigated and understood. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A new method was developed to describe and quantify leaf senescence in a field-grown maize canopy with the purpose of future crop modelling. Leaf shape was analysed using the outlines of over 500 adult leaves from plants grown under diverse culture conditions. Leaf width (lambda) taken at regular distances from the ligule (L) allowed the development of leaf-shape equations. These are third-degree polynomials. Thus, four leaf measurements are needed for characterizing leaf shape: maximum width (lambda m), total length (Lt), width at ligule level (lambda o), and distance from ligule to the point of maximum width (Lx). Assuming y = (lambda/lambda m) and x = (L/Lt), the shape equation can be written as y = (1 - x)(ax(2) + bx + y(o)). Coefficients a and b were estimated from (lambda o/lambda m) = y(o) and (Lx/Lt) = x(m). The leaf area between the ligule and any point on the midrib can be obtained by analytically integrating the leaf shape equation. In the present work, degreening was used as the indicator of senescence. Thus, once the shape equation was been defined, easily taken measurements of "green colour" allowed me to calculate the remaining green area by leaf. The vertical profile of the green area on the whole plant could then be described. The time course of green leaf area in a field-grown maize canopy was analysed from silking up to harvest. The farther the leaves were from the ear and the lower they were in the plant, the earlier they lost their green colour. The smallest leaves fully changed colour in 1 week, while this process took 2 weeks for the largest ones. A whole plant lost its green colour in about 5 weeks. Drought caused earlier but not faster leaf degreening. Low plant densities delayed discoloration of the leaves close to the ear, even under drought conditions. The start of senescence in leaves 7-16 was almost simultaneous in all crop conditions, but it could not be determined whether this was due to a threshold effect of the source/sink ratio or to another factor. This method was easy to set up for field studies with maize, but it could be also used for studies on other graminaceous species and some broad-leaved species. It could be extended to describe the physiological functioning over the leaf length and across the vertical profile of the whole plant.

AB  - The expansion of the earth's population has led to the overuse of land and water resources, which has ultimately resulted in their scarcity. Changing climatic conditions and erratic weather behavior over the years has fueled the existing problems of land and water scarcity and continued to exact a toll on agriculture. Utilization of the latest technologies coupled with advanced methods of crop production will no doubt increase our capacity to deal with these modern challenges of the shortages of resources. Soilless or liquid culture may serve as an alternative to conventional soil-based cultivation systems. The present study was conducted to determine the suitability and viability of hydroponic cultivation as an alternative planting system to greenhouse soil-based lettuce cultivation in temperate regions of northern India. In the present study, two hydroponic techniques viz. deep water culture, and nutrient film technique were evaluated and compared to the conventional soil-based cultivation method under protected conditions. Crop performance, water consumption, and economy were the criteria chosen to assess the efficacy of planting techniques using Tukey's multiple range test at a significance level of 0.05. Deep water culture system was found to be the most desirable concerning the duration of the crop, causing a reduction in the plant growth period by 15 days. Also, higher values of most of the photosynthetic parameters were observed in the deep water culture system, which translated into higher yield/plant for the system. The crop quality also improved under the deep water culture system, which was reflected by the higher values of quality parameters like chlorophyll, total soluble solids, protein, and crude fiber content. Both the hydroponic systems produced significantly higher yield, and nutritionally superior produce in lesser time than the soil-based system (P < 0.05). However, there was a significant reduction in the dry matter content under hydroponic conditions. Nutrient film technique resulted in significant water savings of 64% than the other two techniques. According to economic analysis indicators, both hydroponic techniques performed better than the soil-based systems, having benefit-cost ratios greater than 2. Out of the two techniques tested, deep water culture proved to be the most promising system for adoption under protected agriculture owing to its simplicity, ease of operation, higher yield, economic feasibility, and nutritionally superior produce. The results of the study established hydroponic lettuce production as an appropriate and sustainable alternative to conventional soil-based lettuce production.

AB  - Oreochromis niloticus has been introduced worldwide into freshwater reservoirs and represents an alternative food for local populations. Two annual marks on fish scales have been reported for fish in these environments, one of them is allocated to reproduction, while the other is thought to be formed following low temperatures, a reduction in oxygen concentration and/or high densities, among others. In order to explore the causes of this second ring, we designed an experimental study to analyze the influence of four factors: a reduction in food amount, an increase in density, a decrease in oxygen concentration and temperature. The experiment was carried out using five 215 L plastic tanks, each one divided into two sections, so as to have treatment replicates (each with 20 juveniles). The control conditions were optimal for the species: 5 % of body weight in food, a density of 3 fish/L, a total oxygen saturation of 4.98 +/- 0.5 mg/L, and a temperature of 25.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C; the treatments varied as follows: food of 2.5 % of body weight, density of 6 fish/L, oxygen of 2.8 +/- 1.2 mg/L and a temperature of 19.6 +/- 1.0 degrees C. Fish responses to stressors were estimated through variations in length, weight and inter-circuli spaces or circuli spacing in fish scales. Every third day it was measured the concentrations of ammonium, phosphates and nitrates with a photometer. Three stages for length/weight fish measurements and scales sampling were considered: 1) Initial stage: before experiment started, 2) Final stage: at the end of the experiment, and 3) Compensatory stage: when all the experimental treatments were adjusted to the Control conditions; the experiments lasted for three weeks. The results indicated that all the treatments caused a reduction in length, weight and inter-circuli spaces when compared to the controls (6.7 +/- 0.5 cm; 5.2 +/- 1.2 g; 5.4 +/- 0.5 mu m, respectively), but only the variables of temperature and food resulted significant (5.6 +/- 0.4 and 5.8 +/- 0.5 cm; 3.4 +/- 0.7 and 3.3 +/- 0.9 g; 3.4 +/- 0.3 and 4.1 +/- 0.6 sm for temperature and food treatments, respectively) (P < 0.05). When treatments were reversed to the control conditions for another three weeks compensatory growth was observed in the oxygen and density treatments, but not in the same way for the temperature and food treatments. We concluded that inter-circuli distances are a good indicator to stress periods in this species.

AB  - Given the complex interaction between aerosol, cloud, and atmospheric properties, it is difficult to extract their individual effects to observed rainfall amount. This research uses principle component analysis (PCA) that combines Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol and cloud products, NCEP Reanalysis atmospheric products, and rainrate estimates from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (PR) to assess if aerosols affect warm rain processes. Data collected during September 2006 over the Amazon basin in South America during the biomass-burning season are used. The goal of this research is to combine these observations into a smaller number of variables through PCA with each new variable having a unique physical interpretation. In particular, we are concerned with PC variables whose weightings include aerosol optical thickness (AOT), as these may be an indicator of aerosol indirect effects. If they are indeed occurring, then PC values that include AOT should change as a function of rainrate.
   To emphasize the advantage of PCA, changes in aerosol, cloud, and atmospheric observations are compared to rainrate. Comparing no-rain, rain, and heavy rain only (> 5 mm h(-1)) samples, we find that cloud thicknesses, humidity, and upward motion are all greater during rain and heavy rain conditions. However, no statistically significant difference in AOT exists between each sample, indicating that atmospheric conditions are more important to rainfall than aerosol concentrations as expected. If aerosols are affecting warm process clouds, it would be expected that stratiform precipitation would decrease as a function increasing aerosol concentration through either Twomey and/or semi-direct effects. PCA extracts the latter signal in a variable labeled PC2, which explains 15% of the total variance and is second in importance the variable (PC1) containing the broad atmospheric conditions. PC2 contains weightings showing that AOT is inversely proportional to low-level humidity and cloud optical thickness. Increasing AOT is also positively correlated with increasing low-level instability due to aerosol absorption. The nature of these weightings is strongly suggestive that PC2 is an indicator of the semi-direct effect with larger values associated with lower rainfall rates. PC weightings consistent with the Twomey effect (an anti-correlation between AOT and cloud droplet effective radius) are only present in higher order PC variables that explain less than 1% of the total variance, and do not vary significantly as a function of rainrate. If the Twomey effect is occurring, it is highly non-linear and/or being overshadowed by other processes. Using the raw variables alone, these determinations could not be made; thus, we are able to show the advantage of using advanced statistical techniques such as PCA for analysis of aerosols impacts on precipitation in South America.

AB  - The Baltic Syneclise is one of the Paleozoic basins along the western margin of the East European Craton. Commercial amounts of hydrocarbons have been found onshore and offshore in the Middle Cambrian sandstones and Upper Ordovician limestone reefs. The Middle-Upper Cambrian and Tremadocian bituminous shales have been identified as good quality effective source rocks. The existence of good quality source rocks in the Ordovician and Silurian profiles provides an impetus for conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon explorations in this region. Geochemical analyses revealed that the rocks of the Middle-Late Ordovician and Early Silurian horizons exhibit overall good to very good source rock quality. Within the Ordovician strata, the Sasino and Prabuty formations exhibit the highest amounts of organic carbon with the median total organic carbon (TOC) values of 1.96 and 1.23 wt. %, respectively. The Pastel( and Pelplin formations in the lowest parts of the Lower Silurian stand out clearly from other formations with the median TOC values of 0.91 and 1.15 wt. % and median total hydrocarbon content (S-1+S-2) of 2.46 and 1.54 mg HC/g rock, respectively. The analyzed successions are dominated by immature/early mature, algal (oil-prone) type II, and mixed II/I kerogen deposited in a marine paleoenvironment with anoxic conditions at the bottom and oxic conditions in the photic zone. Immature organic matter prevails in the eastern and central parts of the study area (Goldap-Ketrzyn-Olsztyn area), and the western part (Darzlubie-Hel-Gdansk area) has mature kerogen.

AB  - Despite extensive research, the estimates of changes in employment are heterogeneous in different conditions of economic development. In this study, we examined the impact of the instability of economic growth on the elasticity of the labour market in a set of EU27 member states in the period 2000Q1-2019Q4.The sensitivity of the labour market was quantified in parallel by two available methods which are used for this purpose - by calculating the values of the arc elasticity coefficient and by regression analysis. Logarithmic linear regression models were compiled according to the analysis criteria individually for each member state. By comparing the values of the obtained elasticity indicators, differences in the responses of the labour market were identified. Our results show that the heterogeneity of opinions is to some extent natural. The elasticity of the labour market determined by calculating the values of the elasticity coefficient is characterized by a high variability of values. Similarly, the values of the regression coefficient reflect the nature of the macroeconomic development of the period under review. According to our findings, the frequent short-term trends of negative economic development result in a reduced sensitivity of the labour market to the changes in economic performance, manifested by a lower employment elasticity compared to its values in economies with a stable development trend. Based on this, we formulate the connection between the elasticity of the labour market and the positive and negative economic development. We condition the sensitivity of the labour market to the changes in the trend of economic development with the occurrence of longer-lasting trends of negative economic development.

AB  - The amphipod Diporeia spp. has historically been an important component of the benthic food web of the Laurentian Great Lakes. The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement included its population density as an indicator of ecological condition for Lake Superior, with target values of 220-320 m(-2) in nearshore areas (<= 100 m depth) and 30-160 m(-2) in offshore areas (>100 m). To assess the status of Diporeia in Lake Superior, we used a probability-based lake-wide survey design to obtain estimates of Diporeia density and biomass in 2006, 2011 and 2016. A PONAR grab sampler was used to collect Diporeia at 50-53 sites each year, with approximately half in the nearshore (<100 m depth) region of the lake and half in the offshore. The mean area-weighted lake-wide density was 395 +/- 56 (SE) m(-2) in 2006, 756 +/- 129 m(-2) in 2011, and 502 +/- 60 m(-2) in 2016. For all years, both density and biomass were greater in the nearshore than in the offshore stratum. The densities for 2006-2016 were 3-5 times higher than those reported from a lake-wide survey conducted in 1973 by the Canada Centre for Inland Waters. The severe declines in Diporeia populations observed in the other Great Lakes during recent decades have apparently not occurred in Lake Superior. Further research is needed to understand spatial and temporal variability of Diporeia populations in Lake Superior to enhance the utility of Diporeia density as an indicator of benthic condition.

AB  - Engine calibration requires detailed feedback information that can reflect the combustion process as the optimized objective. Indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) is such an indicator describing an engine's capacity to do work under different combinations of control variables. In this context, it is of interest to find cost-effective solutions that will reduce the number of experimental tests. This paper proposes a random forest machine learning model as a cost-effective tool for optimizing engine performance. Specifically, the model estimated IMEP for a natural gas spark ignited engine obtained from a converted diesel engine. The goal was to develop an economical and robust tool that can help reduce the large number of experiments usually required throughout the design and development of internal combustion engines. The data used for building such correlative model came from engine experiments that varied the spark advance, fuel-air ratio, and engine speed. The inlet conditions and the coolant/oil temperature were maintained constant. As a result, the model inputs were the key engine operation variables that affect engine performance. The trained model was shown to be able to predict the combustion-related feedback information with good accuracy (R-2 approximate to 0.9 and MSE approximate to 0). In addition, the model accurately reproduced the effect of control variables on IMEP, which would help narrow the choice of operating conditions for future designs of experiment. Overall, the machine learning approach presented here can provide new chances for cost-efficient engine analysis and diagnostics work.

AB  - The Late Cretaceous Mukalla Formation is preserved in the Mukalla-Sayhut Basin of Southern Yemen. Using a combination of organic geochemical and petrological methods, we investigated shale intervals in the Mukalla Formation using the Masilah-1 well. We focused on identifying the organic facies and their hydrocarbon generating potential, which has relevance in terms of attracting future hydrocarbon exploration in this basin. The geochemical analysis was conducted on bulk cutting shale samples and indicated fair-good source rock potential, with moderate-high total organic carbon (TOC) contents of 0.51-3.49 wt%. Rock-Eval hydrogen index (HI) pyrolysis results suggested that the organic matter in the analyzed Mukalla shales was mainly type III kerogen; thus, it is likely to have shale-gas generation potential. The high proportions of type III kerogen are consistent with the distributions of lipid biomarkers and visual kerogen typing. Visual kerogen results showed that the analyzed Mukalla shales mainly contained vitrinite organic matter derived from land plants. The biomarker fingerprints of normal alkane, isoprenoid, sterane, and terpane in the saturated hydrocarbon fraction further suggested high contributions of terrestrial organic matter that deposited in fluvial to fluvial-deltaic environments under oxic conditions. The thermal maturation level was inferred from both chemical and optical maturity indicators and indicated that the shale samples, which were buried at relatively shallow depths in the Masilah-1 well, were of low maturity, i.e., within early-mature oil window.

AB  - In market conditions the external environment, economy, technology, politics, culture and society in general that affect the organization's activities are constantly changing. Therefore, strategic analysis and planning is a tool for forming an attitude to the future of the organization taking into account these changes, as a tool for reacting and adapting to such changes.
   To ensure the adaptability of strategic planning, effective contingency measures must be provided for in all types of planning. At the same time, at each stage of strategic planning, its adaptive potential must be realized.
   In a competitive economy, most domestic enterprises are required to make qualitatively new decisions for long-term effective development. Planning should facilitate the adaptation of the enterprise to market requirements in accordance with the goals and objectives of the enterprise, its internal capabilities and environmental conditions. In this regard, planning is becoming more and more strategic. However, traditional long-term planning does not lose its relevance, since strategic planning is based on traditional long-term planning.
   In developed market economies, tools for developing long-term development scenarios for companies have been the subject of research for decades. The experience of foreign forecasting is widely used by Kazakhstani companies today. However, as practice shows, direct use and copying of foreign experience in the development of strategies often lead to errors and distortions. In practice, Kazakh companies need to apply appropriate tools and mechanisms for strategic planning, coordinated and adapted to the specific risks.
   The goals and main provisions of strategic planning of oil companies are discussed in the article. The role of the oil industry in the main macroeconomic indicators of the country's development is shown.

AB  - Palaeonvironmental interpretations and biostratigraphic zonations in northwest Borneo are still a matter of debate but are important for petroleum related applications. The outcrop of Ambug Hill, a late Miocene marine siliciclastic sequence in Brunei Darussalam, has been investigated for its foraminifera assemblage. From a 9.5 m clay-rich interval 50 taxa have been recognized and classified, whenever possible to species level. The studied fauna is characterized by mostly hyaline foraminifera, dominated by two rotaliid species: Cavarotalia annectens and Heterolepa dutemplei. Additionally, a number of miliolids, lageniids, bolivinids and also planktonic foraminifera are present but in much lower abundance. The dominance of the rotaliids points to a sea floor rich in organic carbon characterized by muddy substrates with very low light penetration and the possible growth of patchy sea grass or macroalgae in the system, as indicated by epiphytic foraminifera in the samples. The results obtained give additional insights on how the environmental conditions might have been during the deposition of the deltaic sequences very widespread in the region, and how the fauna coped with such settings. Throughout the investigated samples, the dominance of the assemblages clearly shows alternating stress conditions, typical of pro- deltaic environments.
   The large abundance of rotaliid foraminifera, points toward possible biostratigraphic applications as several taxa within this group have short biozones in the region even though have strong facies dependency. If their role as biostratigraphic indicators could be finally proven, they might be used to date the large depositional sequences occurring in the region, since planktonic index fossils are scarce due to the very proximal settings of the sediments.

AB  - Sustainable development is a balance between economic growth, environmental issues and social conditions. In this respect, urban sustainable development is an important challenge, and a considerable part of sustainable development. Therefore, this study was carried out to assess and predict urban sustainability in different areas of Kermanshah city of Iran using an integrated approach, including the improved full permutation polygon synthetic indicator (IFPPSI) and Shannon's entropy methods. Kermanshah is the largest city located in the west of Iran with six main urban areas, which is facing many environmental, economic and social problems. The results showed that among the six urban areas, Areas 1, 3 and 4 have been shown to be at a moderate level, based on the synthetic indicator value (0.25-0.5). According to the synthetic indicator value (<0.25), the levels of the other areas (2, 5 and 6) are quite bad. The IFPPSI results were also compared with common multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques, ELECTRE of the concordance subgroup, TOPSIS of the compromising subgroup and SAW of the scoring subgroup. The results of the Friedman test showed that there is no significant difference between the MCDM and IFPPSI methods; however, the IFPPSI method is preferred due to its remarkable advantages over the other methods. In a subsequent part, based on the data collected from three time periods, the years 1996, 2006 and 2016, the indicator anticipated for 2026 showing no improvement in the environmental, economic and social indexes compared with the current conditions.

For this reason, the authorization process for veterinary medicinal products in the European Union includes a requirement for higher-tier tests when adverse effects on dung organisms are observed in single-species toxicity tests. However, no guidance documents for the performance of higher-tier tests are available. Hence, an international research project was undertaken to develop and validate a proposed test method under varying field conditions of climate, soil, and endemic coprophilous fauna at Lethbridge (Canada), Montpellier (France), Zurich (Switzerland), and Wageningen (The Netherlands). The specific objectives were to determine if fecal residues of an anthelmintic with known insecticidal activity (ivermectin) showed similar effects across sites on 1) insects breeding in dung of treated animals, 2) coprophilous organisms in the soil beneath the dung, and 3) rates of dung degradation. By evaluating the effects of parasiticides on communities of dung-breeding insects and soil fauna under field conditions, the test method meets the requirements of a higher-tier test as mandated by the European Union. The present study provides contextual information on authorization requirements for veterinary medicinal products and on the structure and function of dung and soil organism communities. It also provides a summary of the main findings. Subsequent studies on this issue provide detailed information on different aspects of this overall project. Environ Toxicol Chem 2016;35:1914-1923.

AB  - We investigated the mineral-magnetic behavior of sediments from Lake Towuti located in the Eastern Sulawesi Ophiolite belt, Indonesia. Rock magnetic analysis supplemented by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analysis were performed on sediment core TOW10-9B from the north basin of Lake Towuti to give insights on the environmental and sedimentary processes controlling the magnetic properties of the sediment and its paleoclimatic significance. The results show that the core has three distinct zones of varying magnetic properties. Careful examination demonstrates that these zones correspond to varying levels of iron oxide dissolution and magnetite precipitation that are climatically and environmentally dependent. The magnetically strongest zone is characterized by weak iron oxide dissolution and intense magnetite precipitation, likely driven by changes in the stratification and/or water level of the lake during dry conditions in Marine Isotope Stage 2 (MIS2) period, whereas the two magnetically weaker zones are characterized by signs of dissolution and correspond to relatively wet conditions, respectively, during Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS3) and the Holocene. Although our data show that major changes in concentration dependent parameters, such as magnetic susceptibility and saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM), in Lake Towuti sediment correlate with changes in regional rainfall, many of the concentration changes are more strongly affected by in situ chemical processes than by changes in erosion and terrestrial sediment supply. These findings urge caution in the interpretation of magnetic mineral concentration profiles as indicators of clastic sediment inputs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Work in this paper investigates the effects of woody vegetation on soil hydraulic conductivity and the related probability of exceeding deformation-based performance limit states. A summary of results obtained from laboratory and field hydraulic conductivity tests for four levee sites is presented. Limit states, as defined based on the framework of critical state soil mechanics, are developed and simple probability analyses are used to quantify the probability of exceedance under hydraulic loading. A case study of Elkhorn Levee near Sacramento, California, is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the limit states concept. The field and laboratory hydraulic conductivity data obtained from the four levee test sites show no clear trend to support the notion that woody vegetation leads to either high or low values of hydraulic conductivity; site-specific testing is needed to discern such an effect. Even though the levee case used in this study (Elkhorn) was in a marginal condition of stability, based on limit equilibrium analysis, the probability of exceeding LS III after 10 days of a sustained high water level was 2%. This probability, however, increased over time to 37 and 72% after 20 and 30 days of sustained water loading, respectively, which signifies the importance of considering the transient nature of hydraulic loading in making condition assessments after a storm event. The results of modeling a 0.75-m top root layer illustrate the impact of woody vegetation on time duration to exceed a given performance LS level and the importance of accounting for seepage-deformation responses in assessing the vulnerability of levees.

AB  - Recently, there has been public concern that water quality in the nearshore of Southeast Lake Huron has been deteriorating, inferred partly from fouling of shoreline by algae. In 2010, fine-scale patterns in nutrient concentrations and other water quality features were examined to better understand the influence of the adjacent land on the nearshore environment in the region. Surveys at two areas of coastline were conducted over a seasonal cycle. Monitoring of water quality in tributaries to the study areas indicated that water of poor quality was periodically discharged to the lake as indicated by elevated levels of nutrients, fecal indicator bacteria, suspended solids and chloride. The extent of the nearshore that was directly influenced by land runoff was small, restricted to the shoreline fringe, relative to the broader nearshore. Pulse-like inputs of phosphorus from wave-induced erosional events and periods of precipitation-related runoff, both characterized by high levels of particle-bound phosphorus, contributed to highly dynamic and spatially variable levels of total phosphorus (TP), and proportions of TP in dissolved form, in the nearshore. The proportion of TP associated with particulate material was strongly correlated with lake depth. Phosphorus distributions in the nearshore indicate contrasting conditions with proximity to shoreline. Land runoff enriches nutrient levels along sections of the immediate shoreline, which contrasts sharply with the ultraoligotrophic conditions in the broader nearshore. The nearshore of Lake Huron arguably has always been highly sensitive to phosphorus pollution and it appears likely that the shoreline may be even more so today.

AB  - Nitrogen and phosphorous loading into waterways from designated beneficial uses of reclaimed water is a growing concern in many parts of the United States. Numerous studies have documented that organic microconstituents present in the reclaimed water can be utilized as indicators of its influence on surface water bodies. However, little to no information is available on the environmental attenuation of these microconstituents relative to the nutrients, which is a critical component in determining the effectiveness or limitations of those markers as a tool for elucidating their origins. In this study, the stability of selected markers (sucralose, carbamazepine, gadolinium anomaly, iohexol, and atenolol) was evaluated through bench-scale studies designed to simulate environmental conditions associated with biodegradation, adsorption, and photolysis. The primary pathway for nitrogen reduction was biodegradation (greater than 99%) while the highest phosphorous removal was due to adsorption (30-80%). Soils with low organic content were selected for this study. Sucralose was the most recalcitrant microconstituent in the environment with less than 15% removal by adsorption, biodegradation, or photolysis. Iohexol was too susceptible to photolysis (90% removal), and atenolol was susceptible to biodegradation (60-80% removal). Gd anomaly was fairly stable (less than 30% removal) in the environment. Carbamazepine was another efficacious marker for wastewater, but was susceptible (50% removal) to photolysis. Of the selected microconstituents, only atenolol showed any similarity with the attenuation observed for nitrate and none of the microconstituents showed any similarity with the attenuation observed for phosphorus.

AB  - Alongshore transport was estimated from the gridded AVISO altimeter data and water level data from NOAA tide gauges (1993-2010) for the northern California Current (NCC) system. The biomass of the cold neritic copepods including Calanus marshallae, Pseudocalanus mimus and Acartia longiremis (dominants in the eastern Bering Sea, coastal Gulf of Alaska, and NCC) was estimated from a 15 year time series of zooplankton samples (1996-2010) collected biweekly at a coastal station 9 km off Newport Oregon U. S. A. The alongshore currents and the biomass of the cold neritic copepods exhibit a strong seasonal pattern and fluctuate in opposite phase: positive alongshore current (from south) leads to low biomass in winter and negative alongshore current (from north) leads to high biomass in summer. When the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is positive, i.e., warm conditions around the northeast Pacific, there is more movement of water from the south in the NCC during winter. When the PDO is negative, there is more movement of water from the north during summer. The mean biomass of cold neritic copepods was positively correlated with the survival rate of juvenile coho salmon and cumulative transport was negatively correlated with coho salmon survival, i.e., in years when a greater portion of the source waters feeding the NCC enters from the north, the greater the salmon survival. We conclude that alongshore transport manifests PDO signals and serves as a linkage between large scale forcing to local ecosystem dynamics. Citation: Bi, H., W. T. Peterson, and P. T.

AB  - Spatial and temporal patterns of dissolved oxygen (DO) in Yaquina Estuary, Oregon (USA) are examined using historic and recent data. There was a significant increasing trend in DO in the upstream portion of the estuary during the years 1960-1985. Historically, minimum dry season (May-October) DO levels occurred about 20 km from the estuary mouth at warm water temperatures, near both point source discharges and where extensive log rafting occurred. Presently, there is a trend of increasing dry season DO with increasing distance from the mouth of the estuary. Minimum DO levels occur at cool water temperatures (similar to 8 deg C), suggesting that recently upwelled oceanic water from the shelf is the source of the low DO water. Recent time-series data (2001-2007) demonstrates that the water advected into the estuary from the coastal ocean has DO levels < 5 mg l(-1) about 13% of the time during the dry season and that water temperature is a good indicator of the oceanic source. Similarity in the flood-tide DO and water temperature relationship between recent time-series data in Yaquina and in historic data from other estuaries suggests that the hypoxic conditions observed off the Oregon coast since 2002 may have occurred previously, especially during the 1950's-1960's. It is important to characterize the natural background DO levels for estuaries in the region to be able to separate anthropogenic from natural influences on DO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Literature data from 1905/06, 1912/13 and 1949/50 were compared with recent data (2001-2003) from Kiel Bight in order to investigate changes in phytoplankton composition and biomass, which may serve as indicators of environmental changes. In terms of biomass, diatomophyceae and dinophyceae are by far the most important groups. Their ratio is still close to unity. The share of diatomophyceae increased strongly in years with exceptionally high summer blooms (2001) or exceptionally early spring blooms (2003). The summer and autumn blooms of Chaetoceros and Skeletonema, detected in the early 20th century, are replaced by other diatoms (Cerataulina pelagica, Dactyliosolen fragilissimus, Proboscia alata, Pseudo-nitzschia spp.). Chaetoceros and Skeletonema are still important components of the spring blooms. Now as before, the autumn blooms are dominated by Ceratium spp., sometimes also by diatoms. Newly appearing bloom-forming species are mostly potentially toxic (Dicryocha speculum, Prorocentrum minimum, Pseudo-nitzschia spp.). The total phytoplankton biomass has roughly doubled in the course of the last century. The reference condition for phytoplankton biomass in Kiel Bight in the sense of the Water Framework Directive was defined at 55 mg C m(-3) (+/- 10%, annual mean). The mean annual biomass of diatomophyceae and dinophyceae was 25 mg C m-3 (+/- 40%) for each, indicating that the sum of their carbon biomass amounted to 90% (+/- 10%) of the total phytoplankton biomass on an annual average. Diatomophyceae represented at least 80% of carbon biomass in the spring bloom peak at the beginning of the 20th century. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal dunes display complex relationships among soil properties, vegetation, and geomorphology driven by marine and atmospheric dynamics. Considering topography as a fundamental control of the relations, this study investigated its influence on the spatial pattern of soil attributes in a coastal dune. We systematically collected 193 soil samples at intervals of 20 m from the Sindu coastal dunefield, South Korea, and analyzed 11 soil attributes. Principal component analysis extracted four main factors explaining ca. 75% of total soil variance. Correlation between each soil factor and topographic attributes calculated from raster digital elevation models permitted us to infer relationships between dune configuration and soil spatial variability. Interpretation of the first two factors demonstrated that nutrient input from marine sources by aeolian processes and topographic relief, an indirect measure of depth to the freshwater table, were two major determinants of the spatial distribution of soil properties. For the first factor, distance from the seashore proved to be the most significant indicator of edaphic conditions. Upslope area and wetness index were good proxies for the second factor, dune relief. These two variables significantly explained the distribution of soil moisture. A conceptual model is presented to describe how complex dune soil systems are created from simple topographic effects. The model addresses the importance of integrating foredune, dune slack, and inner dune ridge into one continuous system because topography, geomorphic (aeolian) processes, vegetation, and edaphic conditions are closely connected in a causal chain across the whole dune area.

AB  - The impact of cattle grazing on the vegetation of calcareous fens was compared to the effects of traditional autumn mowing in southern Germany. Vegetation composition was studied in adjacent pairs of fen meadows and pastures with similar environmental conditions and biomass production. Vegetation data were analysed with respect to species richness, species composition and response of species traits to disturbance, including morphology, defence mechanisms, clonal growth form and generative reproduction. Species richness was significantly reduced by grazing, but the percentage of typical fen species or Red Data Book species was not affected by land use type. Detrended Corrspondence Analysis indicated that species composition could best be explained in terms of a land use gradient. Species traits showed a clear trend in their response to land use type. Grazing favoured grasses and small forbs. Only a few species with defence mechanisms against foraging were more frequent or abundant on pastures. Many other species with defence mechanisms, however, did not have an advantage on pastures. Flowering and seed dispersal traits did not respond significantly to grazing or mowing. Species with fast spreading stem derived clonal organs were favoured on pastures, whereas all other clonal growth forms and, particularly, non-clonal species were more abundant on meadows. More indicator species of wet soil conditions and species adapted to flooding were found on pastures. Grazing can be recommended as an alternative land use to mowing in contrast to abandonment, but a reduction in species richness and changes in species composition and species traits may occur.

AB  - Southern Ontario, Canada, has late Pleistocene deposits that contain evidence for climatic cooling during the last interglacial/glacial transition and much of the succeeding Wisconsin glaciation. Fossils of lacustrine and riverine caddisflies (Insecta: Trichoptera) are abundant and well-preserved in these deposits. We examined 26 samples from the interglacial section exposed in the Don Valley Brickyard and compared their caddisfly assemblages with those recovered from the overlying early Wisconsin Scarborough Formation deposits at nearby Scarborough Bluffs. Fifty-one caddisfly taxa in 16 families were recovered from the Don Valley site. Fossil abundance and species richness appear related to the storm or fair-weather conditions inferred from the sedimentary facies. Caddisfly fossils were most abundant and species richness highest in fair-weather, peaty, rippled sands. Highest proportions of river species as opposed to lake species were recovered from sands (storm and fair-weather). Assemblages from both sites indicate the presence of a large and productive river flowing into ancestral Lake Ontario. However, the river assemblage appeared to be far more sensitive to environmental change than the relatively stable assemblage representing the thermally buffered lake. Warm temperate river species such as Hydropsyche bidens, Hydropsyche mississippiensis, Macrostemum carolina, and Potamyia flava are present in the lower Don samples but absent from the Scarborough Bluffs deposits, while indicators of cooler than present climatic conditions such as Arctopsyche ladogensis and Hagenella canadensis are present in the Scarborough Bluffs sediments but absent from the lower Don samples. For the interval from about 80,000 to 55,000 yr B.P., we infer a climatic cooling from temperature about 2 degrees C warmer than present to about 3 degrees C cooler than present.

AB  - Photosynthetic activity was measured in hypersaline Mono Lake during an 8-yr period (1983-1990) spanning the onset (1983), persistence (1984-1987), and breakdown of meromixis (1988). Algal biomass in spring and autumn decreased following the onset of meromixis and annual photosynthetic production was reduced (269-462 g C m-2 yr-1; 1984-1986) compared to nonmeromictic conditions (499-641 g C m-2 yr-1; 1989 and 1990). A gradual increase in photosynthetic production occurred even before meromixis ended because of increased vertical flux of ammonium due to deeper mixing and the buildup of ammonium in the monimolimnion. Annual production was greatest in 1988 (1,064 g C m-2 yr-1) when the weakening of chemical stratification and eventual breakdown of meromixis in November resulted in large fluxes of ammonium into the euphotic zone.
   Most of the variation in rates of light-saturated carbon uptake normalized to chlorophyll a (assimilation numbers) was explained by a regression on temperature (60%); measures of the light and nutrient environments accounted for a further 8% of the observed variation. Estimates of ammonium supply due to vertical mixing and Artemia monica excretion indicate nitrogen is most likely to limit photosynthetic production during spring and late autumn when A. monica is absent and algal biomass high. Light is also likely to limit production during these periods based on comparisons of the average mixed-layer irradiance to the light intensity at which maximum photosynthetic rates were reached. Light limitation was more pronounced under monomictic conditions when algal biomass was higher.

AB  - The tightened approach of the European Commission to the issue of meeting the levels of pollutant emissions to the environment, inextricably connected with the level of technology used, is a serious financial challenge for many European coke producers, therefore the main aim of the article is to develop an algorithm of conduct that allows a selection of the best available emission abatement techniques from the coking plant in conditions with multiple emission sources, taking into account technological, environmental, and economic criteria. This algorithm can be used as a universal tool supporting production managers in planning investments limiting the environmental impact of the coking plant in the most economically advantageous way, while using BAT techniques. In the development of the algorithm, a multi-criteria analysis and a scenario method were used, as well as a number of typical methods for measuring and reducing the level of emissions in the coke production process. Its demonstration and verification were carried out within ten investment scenarios prepared for a selected coking plant. The presented method of selecting the optimal scenario is universal and allows for a flexible selection of weights for the criteria depending on the needs and limits of the investor at a given time or to long term plans to adapt to the increasingly tightening environmental requirements. This method can also be used in discussions with the authorities issuing integrated permits as regards the deadlines for adapting to legal requirements.

AB  - Chlorinated ethenes (CEs) are most problematic pollutants in groundwater. Dehalogenating bacteria, and in particular organohalide-respiring bacteria (OHRB), can transform PCE to ethene under anaerobic conditions, and thus contribute to bioremediation of contaminated sites. Current approaches to characterize in situ biodegradation of CEs include hydrochemical analyses, quantification of the abundance of key species (e.g. Dehatococcoides mccartyi) and clehalogenase genes (pceA, VCTA, bycA and tceA) involved in different steps of organohalkle respiration (OHR) by qPCR, and compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) of CEs. Here we combined these approaches with sequencing of 16S I-RNA gene amplicons to consider both OHRB and bacterial taxa involved in CE transformation at a multicontaminated site. Integrated analysis of hydrogeochemical characteristics, gene abundances and bacterial diversity shows that bacterial diversity and OHRB mainly correlated with hydrogeochemical conditions, suggesting that pollutant exposure acts as a central driver of bacterial diversify. CSIA, abundances of four reductive clehalogenase encoding genes and the prevalence of Deliatocuccuides highlighted sustained PCE, DCE and VC degradation in several wells of the polluted plume. These results suggest that bacterial taxa associated with OHR play an essential role in natural attenuation of CEs, and that representatives of taxa including Dehalobacteriu rn and Desulfosporosinus cooccur with Dehalococcoides. Overall, our study emphasizes the benefits of combining several approaches to evaluate the interplay between the dynamics of bacterial diversity in CE-polluted plumes and in situ degradation of CEs, and to contribute to a more robust assessment of natural attenuation at multi-polluted sites.

AB  - Green technologies are of great interest as they are frequently culled by domestic households and industrial sectors, especially in intelligent farming applications. The power supply resource is the main factor that is used in an outdoor environment because it is not convenient to use a wall adapter in outdoor conditions. In this study, the quality of the environment monitoring system and green power supply has been developed using solar energy resources, which are more convenient to facilitate the outdoor environment without any wall adapter or external battery added. Thus, a weather monitoring system embedded with solar power source management is proposed to focus on data linkage quality measurement based on received signal strength (RSS). This proposed system involves the application of wireless RF ZigBee-Pro technology based on the IEEE802.15.4 standard using 2.4 GHz in a microwave frequency band. The environment monitoring system consists of multiple biosensors: oxygen (O-2), temperature, and humidity sensors to monitor the environmental condition of a farm area. The monitored information data of the environment monitoring system according to its sensing as mentioned are transmitted to the host station correctly with well-received signal strength indicator (RSSI) value with usage convenience at both of the indoor and outdoor environments. The results indicated that the solar panel kept a maximum current and maximum power of 335.48 mA and 8.76 W, respectively, at noontime. Moreover, the RSSI performance is an essential factor for the wireless communication networking for the environment monitoring system between the solar power and wall adapter supplies, which is suitable for the intelligent farming application. The findings indicated that both power sources' quality is a similar performance at the confidence of 95 %.

AB  - Research increasingly shows that greening activity can spur contagious or imitative behavior among nearby neighbors within residential landscapes. Krusky et al. (2015) examined this phenomenon in the context of vacant lots and found support for a "greening hypothesis" that residential yards near vacant lots that were converted to community gardens exhibited higher levels of care than yards near untended vacant lots. Although such activity implies a temporal, causal relationship, research to date has only tested the spatial dimension of greening through correlational measures of proximity assessed at one point in time. We extend this work by analyzing vacant lot greening as a function of time, space, scale of analysis, and other factors. We studied residential property owners (N = 321) who purchased nearby city-owned vacant lots through the Chicago Large Lot Program. Improvements made in the condition and care of large lots in the year after purchase were positively related to the proximity, condition and care of the individual's previously owned property, and signs of use and care of the lot before purchase (blotting). We also examined whether block-level indicators of care and disorder were associated with improvements made to lots purchased on the block. We found few associations but discovered these same block-level indicators of care and disorder more strongly predicted the percent of large lots sold on that block, suggesting that greening activity may be bidirectional. These findings expand understanding of the dynamics of vacant lot stewardship and have implications for building more robust theories of urban greening.

AB  - A study was undertaken to identify patterns of consumer use of outdoor wood boilers or outdoor wood furnaces (technically referred to as outdoor wood-fired hydronic heaters (OWHHs)) and indoor wood stoves (IWSs) to inform the development of performance testing protocols that reflect real-life operating conditions. These devices are manually fed, and their usage protocols are a function of a number of variables, including user habits, household characteristics, and environmental factors. In this study, researchers logged the stack wall temperatures of 4 OWHH and 20 IWS units in the states of New York and Washington over two heating seasons. Stack wall temperature is an indicator of changes in combustion modes. Two algorithms were developed to identify usage modes and cold and warm start refueling events from the stack wall temperature time series. A linear correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of heat demand on usage patterns. The results and methods presented here will inform the cataloging of typical operational patterns of OWHHs and IWSs as a step in the development of performance testing procedures that represent actual in-home usage patterns. Implications: Current US regulatory programs for residential wood heating use a certification program to assess emissions and efficiency performance. Testing under this program uses a test that burns 100% of a single, standardized wood fuel charge to assess performance at different steady-state load conditions. This study assessed in-field operational patterns to determine if the current certification approach accurately characterized typical homeowner use patterns. The data from this study can be used to inform revisions to testing methods to increase certification test comparability between lab and field performance.

AB  - Much environmental enrichment for laboratory animals is intended to enhance animal welfare and normalcy by providing stimulation to reduce 'boredom'. Behavioural manifestations of boredom include restless sensation-seeking behaviours combined with indicators of sub-optimal arousal. Here, we explored whether these signs could be reduced by extra daily play opportunity in laboratory ferrets (Mustela putorius furo). Specifically, we hypothesised that playtime would reduce restlessness, aggression, sensation-seeking and awake drowsiness, even 24 h later in the home-cage. Female ferrets (n = 14) were group-housed in enriched multi-level cages. Playtime involved exploring a room containing a ball pool, paper bags, balls containing bells, and a familiar interactive human for 1 h. This was repeated on three consecutive mornings, and on the fourth, home-cage behaviour was compared between ferrets which had experienced the playtime treatment versus control cage-mates which had not. Their investigation of stimuli (positive = mouse odour or ball; ambiguous = empty bottle or tea-strainer; and negative = peppermint or bitter apple odour) was also recorded. We then swapped treatments, creating a paired experimental design. Ferrets under control conditions lay awake with their eyes open and screeched significantly more, but slept and sat/stood less, than following playtime. They also contacted negative and ambiguous stimuli for significantly longer under control conditions than following playtime; contact with positive stimuli showed no effects. Attempts to blind the observer to treatments were unsuccessful, so replication is required, but the findings suggest that playtime may have reduced both sub-optimal arousal and restless sensation-seeking behaviour, consistent with reducing boredom.

AB  - BACKGROUND This paper evaluates the nitrification and sulfide-driven autotrophic denitrification processes in a structured-bed reactor subjected to recirculation and intermittent aeration (SBRRIA) applied to the post-treatment of an anaerobic effluent. The SBRRIA reactor was operated during 130 days in which influent sulfide concentrations varied between 220.1 and 231.0 mg TDS L-1 (TDS, total dissolved solids). Temporal tests were performed to elucidate the dynamics and sulfide impacts on combined processes. RESULTS Sulfide partially inhibited the nitrifying activity, resulting in low NH4+-N oxidation. This fact affected the overall nitrogen removal performance as total-N removal efficiencies of 50 and 55% were attained in Conditions III and IV, respectively. On the one hand, under continuous aeration and in the absence of sulfide, the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) reached 50 mV (versus Ag/AgCl) after 250 min of experiment. On the other, when sulfide was continuously provided in the feeding, the ORP was maintained lower than zero. Under anoxic conditions, the effective use of sulfide as an electron donor by autotrophic denitrification was verified by ORP monitoring. However, a concentration of 260 mg TDS L-1 associated with high pH proved inhibitory for NO3- reduction. CONCLUSIONS Based on the results obtained, new strategies of adding sulfide to the SBRRIA should be tested to minimize its inhibitory effect on nitrification and improve nitrogen removal in this unit.

AB  - The honeybee Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) is an important pollinator, an object of human economic activity and a bioindicator of environmental pollution. Insecticides used in Agriculture for treatment of plants, bee colonies, and farm animals may be dangerous for bees. This paper reports the results of a comparative assessment of the acute contact toxicity of four toxic bait formulations designed for insect pest control on livestock farms to the honeybees. Toxic baits consisted acetamiprid, ivermectin, chlorfenapyr, and fipronil, with residues of which on the filter paper adult bees contacted on plastic containers. It was found that the bait formulation with ivermectin manifested toxicity slower than the other ones. We used probit analysis to calculate median lethal doses (LD50) of each active substance showed that their toxicity to bees decreased in the following order: fipronil -ivermectin - chlorfenapyr - acetamiprid. Considering the mass content of active substances in formulations, median lethal doses of toxic baits were 202.6 mu g/bee (bait with fipronil), 229.3 mu g/bee (bait with ivermectin), 1188.3 mu g/bee (bait with chlorfenapyr), and 6552 mu g/bee (bait with acetamiprid). Thus, bait formulations themselves may be considered practically nontoxic to bees, since their LD50 exceeded the threshold value of 100 mu g/bee. Assessment of hazard degree for bees by the hazard index showed that the insecticide bait containing acetamiprid were less dangerous than the other three bait formulations under laboratory conditions. The future semi-field and field studies are needed to evaluate the possible exposure and the hazard degree of insecticidal baits for bees under conditions close to practice use of these formulations.

AB  - Stenotrophomonas maltophilia , a Gram-negative, multi-drug-resistant bacterium, is increasingly recognized as a key opportunistic pathogen. Thus, we embarked upon an investigation of S. maltophilia iron acquisition. To begin, we determined that the genome of strain K279a is predicted to encode a complete siderophore system, including a biosynthesis pathway, an outer-membrane receptor for ferrisiderophore, and other import and export machinery. Compatible with these data, K279a and other clinical isolates of S. maltophilia secreted a siderophore-like activity when grown at 25-37 degrees C in low-iron media, as demonstrated by a chrome azurol S assay, which detects iron chelation, and Arnow and Rioux assays, which detect catecholate structures. Importantly, these supernatants rescued the growth of iron-starved S. maltophilia , documenting the presence of a biologically active siderophore. A mutation in one of the predicted biosynthesis genes (entC) abolished production of the siderophore and impaired bacterial growth in low-iron conditions. Inactivation of the putative receptor gene (fepA ) prevented the utilization of siderophore-containing supernatants for growth in low-iron conditions. Although the biosynthesis and import loci showed some similarity to those of enterobactin, a well-known catecholate made by enteric bacteria, the siderophore of K279a was unable to rescue the growth of an enterobactin-utilizing indicator strain, and conversely iron-starved S. maltophilia could not use purified enterobactin. Furthermore, the S. maltophilia siderophore displayed patterns of solubility in organic compounds and mobility upon thin-layer chromatography that were distinct from those of enterobactin and its derivative, salmochelin. Together, these data demonstrate that S. maltophilia secretes a novel catecholate siderophore.

AB  - A green and robust reverse-phase liquid chromatographic method has been developed for the determination of fenoverine (FEN), by applying combined principles of green analytical chemistry and quality by design approaches on a Spherisorb C18 column (150x4.6mm, 3 mu m) with UV detection at 262nm. A two level fractional factorial design (2<^>(7-3)) Res IV was used for screening of influential chromatographic factors. The critical method parameters actively affecting critical quality attributes (CQAs) were identified and further optimized using Box-Behnken design. The predicted optimum assay conditions comprised of methanol and ammonium acetate buffer 20mM, in an extent of 81:19% v/v individually having a flow rate of 1.0mL/min with a column oven temperature of 33 degrees C. The drug was stressed in hydrolytic, oxidative, reductive, thermal, and photolytic conditions. The developed method was validated successfully. The detector response was linear in the concentration of 0.5-160 mu g/mL with a limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) as 0.1 and 0.3 mu g/mL, respectively. The % recovery was found to be 99.7%. The analytical method volume intensity value for developed method was 45mL and the environment assessment tool (EAT) score was 41.07. The method is simple, environmentally benign, rapid, and robust for the determination of FEN in bulk and in its dosage form.

AB  - Studying plants' capability to adapt and recover from drought stress is essential because of the ever-changing nature of drought events. To evaluate the genotypically variable morpho-physiological adaptations to drought stress and recovery after re-watering, two wheat cultivars (Luhan-7 and Yangmai-16) were pot-cultured under three levels of water stress: severe (35-40% field capacity, FC) and moderate water deficits (55-60% FC) and well-watered conditions. Drought stress was applied at tillering (Feekes 2 stage) and jointing (Feekes 6 stage), respectively, followed by re-watering, and we observed changes in leaf characteristics, growth and physiological activities during water stress and rewatering periods as well as final grain yield traits at maturity. Results showed that drought stress adaptability associated with reduced leaf area, higher leaf thickness, chlorophyll, leaf dry matter and maintenance of leaf water potential were more strongly pronounced in Luhan-7 than in Yangmai-16. Under moderate stress both cultivars exhibited a small decrease in leaf gas-exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence activities, followed by rapid recovery. Under severe drought stress, Yangmai-16 displayed relatively less adaptability to drought, with a slower recovery after re-watering and a greater decrease in grain yield. It was concluded that even though crop growth rate completely recovered after re-watering, the final dry matter and grain yield outcomes were affected by pre-drought stress, and were dependant on the drought intensity, adaptability and recovery differences of the cultivars and growth stage. It was also concluded that genotypic variations in adaptability and recovery from drought stress are the indicators of drought tolerance and grain yield sustainability in wheat.

AB  - The environmental impact of three different urban solid waste facilities (USWF) on the quality of the surface water. The studied areas were the Campo Belo sanitary landfill (Varoes River), the controlled landfill of Santo Antonio do Amparo (Fabiano River), and the closed dump of Eloi Mendes (Mutuca River), which are cities located in southern Minas Gerais state, Brazil were evaluated. At each sampling point water samples were collected at five occasions in the raining season (October - March) and in the dry season (April - June) at three sampling points: (P1) upstream the solid waste facility, (P2) downstream nearby the point of influx from the sewage treatment plant in the sanitary landfill, or at the drainage point from the surface flow of the dump and controlled landfill, and (P3) downstream the solid waste facility. Physicochemical and bacteriological analyses were performed, and the results were analyzed based on descriptive statistics. The data were also compared with reference values from the National Environmental Council (CONAMA) Resolution 357/2005 and were used to calculate the water quality index (WQI). It was not possible to detect a significant effect of the solid waste facility on the water quality indicators. The water conditions were unsatisfactory due to violations of the concentrations of phosphorus, ammonia, fecal coliform, and the biochemical oxygen demand/chemical oxygen demand ratio (BOD/COD), probably related to other uses along the drainage area upstream the solid waste facility. These conditions were more critical in the Mutuca river, where the WQI was classified as bad during the entire period at all sampling points.

AB  - Juvenile marine growth (SW1) of salmon and a new temperature change (TC) index were evaluated as ecosystem indicators and predictors for the post age-0 year class strength (YCS) of groundfish in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and eastern Bering Sea (EBS). Our hypothesis was that SW1, as measured on the scales of adult Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), is a proxy for ocean productivity on the continental shelf, a rearing area for young salmon and groundfish. Less negative TC index values are the result of a cool late summer followed by a warm spring, conditions favorable for groundfish YCS. In the GOA, SW1 was a positive predictor of age-1 pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), but not age-2 sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) YCS, indicating that the growth of the Karluk River sockeye salmon that enter Shelikof Strait is a proxy for ocean conditions experienced by age-0 pollock. Contrary to our hypotheses, the TC index was a negative predictor of GOA pollock YCS; and the SW1 a negative predictor of EBS pollock and cod YCS since the 1980s. Recent fisheries oceanography survey results provide insight into possible mechanisms to support the inverse SW1 and YCS relationship. For the EBS, the TC index was a significant positive predictor for pollock and cod YCS, supporting the hypothesis that a cool late summer followed by a warm spring maximizes the over-wintering survival of pollock and cod (Gadus macrocephalus), especially since the 1980s. The TC and SW1 index showed value for the assessment of pollock and cod, but not sablefish.

AB  - Hydrocarbons such as CH4 are known to be formed through the Fischer-Tropsch or Sabatier type reactions in hydrothermal systems usually at temperatures above 100 degrees C. Weathering of olivine is sometimes suggested to account for abiotic formation of CH4 through its redox lowering and water splitting properties. Knowledge about the CH4 and H-2 formation processes at low temperatures is important for the research about the origin and cause of early Earth and Martian CH4 and for CO2 sequestration. We have conducted a series of low temperature, long-term weathering experiments in which we have tested the CH4 and H-2 formation potential of forsteritic olivine. The results show low temperature CH4 production that is probably influenced by chromite and magnetite as catalysts. Extensive analyses of a potential CH4 source trapped in the crystal structure of the olivine showed no signs of incorporated CH4. Also, the available sources of organic carbon were not enough to support the total amount of CH4 detected in our experiments. There was also a linear relationship between silica release into solution and the net CH4 accumulation into the incubation bottle headspaces suggesting that CH4 formation under these conditions could be a qualitative indicator of olivine dissolution.
   It is likely that minerals such as magnetite, chromite and other metal-rich minerals found on the olivine surface catalyze the formation of CH4, because of the low temperature of the system. This may expand the range of environments plausible for abiotic CH4 formation both on Earth and on other terrestrial bodies.

AB  - The ridge-slough landscape of the Everglades (Florida, USA), is characterized by elevated ridges dominated by sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense) interspersed among deeper sloughs dominated by floating, submerged and emergent macrophytes and calcareous periphyton. Interactions among hydrologic conditions (water depth, hydroperiod), plant composition and production, and respiration are hypothesized to create alternative peat accretion equilibria at the point scale, while spatial interactions among patches create regular pattern at the landscape scale. Despite significant research on these interactions, few studies have examined the hypothesis that the ridge-slough landscape consists of spatially coupled alternative stable patch states, and none has used diagnostic indicators thereof to assess landscape resilience to hydrologic change. Dense random sampling of water depths (a proxy for soil elevation) along a gradient of hydrologic impairment of drained to relatively natural to impounded conditions was used to evaluate four predictions related to this hypothesis: (1) bimodal soil elevation distributions show strong fidelity to community type; (2) positive autocorrelation at short distances with negative values at longer distances; (3) strong anisotropy (diagnostic of flow orientation), and spatial structure (diagnostic of the strength of landscape self-organization); and (4) loss of these features with hydrologic modification. Our results support the hypothesis that soil elevations are strongly bimodal and anisotropic in areas with minimal hydrologic impact, and spatial autocorrelation patterns indicate the operation of scale-dependent feedbacks. These metrics change markedly with hydrologic modification, although with differences between drainage and impoundment. Moreover, changes in landform precede associated changes in vegetation, suggesting their utility as diagnostic indicators of landscape degradation and recovery.

AB  - Transformation products of pharmaceuticals formed by human metabolism within sewage treatment plant or receiving waters are predicted, in most cases, to be less toxic than the parent compound to common aquatic species. However, there is little available data to demonstrate whether this is generally the case. In the present study, a framework was developed to guide testing of transformation products using phototransformation of the beta-blocker propranolol to test the hypothesis for this particular transformation route. Phototransformation is an important depletion mechanism of some pharmaceuticals in surface waters with fast reaction rate constants at environmentally relevant conditions. Samples of propranolol in deionized water (DIW) and river water (RW) were exposed to a solar simulator (lambda:295-800 nm) and comparative toxicity of propranolol and its degraded mixtures measured using algal (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) and rotifer (Brachionus calyciflorus) screening tests. Results suggested a reduction of toxicity in photodegraded mixtures compared to the parent active pharmaceutical ingredient in all samples tested. Chemical analysis of effect test solutions supported the hypothesis that propranolol was transformed into compounds that appear to be less toxic to the organisms tested under the study conditions. Although the reactions were much faster in RW than in DIW, profiles of transformation products were similar in both matrices at two starting concentrations (1 and 10 mg/L). Results for propranolol implied that the reduction of toxicity using algal and rotifer screening tests was probably due to the production of more hydrophilic and more polar transformation products. Such results will provide useful insights into the environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals by taking into account their transformation products.

AB  - This paper presents new data on distribution patterns of modem benthic foraminifera and other microfossils from the Canadian Arctic, specifically the Beaufort Shelf and slope. The material was collected in June to August of 2004 and is the first of its kind in this area to be collected since 1970. We examined the smaller sizes (45-63 mu m) as well as > 63 mu m and discovered that many species had been severely underrepresented in previous studies. Deep sea forms, that had been overlooked previously, were common on the shelf; two species (Elphidiella arctica and Ammotium cassis) appeared in preliminary results to be indicators of methane seepage; and it was possible to make determinations of sea-ice coverage using a combination of foraminifera and tintinnids (planktic ciliates). Our data indicated the presence of many of the same species as previous studies from this area, but improved techniques of sample processing greatly increased the number of specimens and species found (particularly the small deep sea arctic species Buliminella hensoni and Bolivina arctica) which provide much more reliable data for paleoceanographic determinations. One of the primary objectives for this work was to provide baseline data to help determine paleo-ice cover; these data cover a broad range of conditions on the Beaufort Shelf that make it possible to achieve this objective as well as improving what it is known about the assemblages on this shelf as compared to other arctic shelf areas, such as the Siberian Shelf).

AB  - Environmental studies require multivariate data such as chemical concentrations with space-time coordinates. There are two general conditions related to such data: the existence of correlations among the coregionalized variables and the differences in numbers of data which occur because of insufficient data caused by measurement error or bad weather conditions. This study proposes geostatistical techniques for space-time multivariate modeling that take into consideration these correlations and data absences. These techniques consist of suitable modeling of semivariograms and cross-semivariograms for quantifying correlation structures among multivariables and of extending standardized ordinary cokriging. The tensor product cubic smoothing surface method is used for space-time semivariogram modeling. These methods are applied to the chemical component data of the Ariake Sea, a typical closed sea in southwest Japan. In order to clarify environmental changes in the Ariake Sea, the concentration data of four nutritive salts (NO2-N, NO3-N, NH4-N, and PO4-P) at 38 stations over 25 years are used as environmental indicators. For each of the kinds of data, there are spaces and times for which there is no data available. The effectiveness of the modeling of space-time semivariograms and the high estimation capability of the extended cokriging are demonstrated by cross-validation. Compared with ordinary kriging for a single variable, multivariate space-time standardized ordinary cokriging can provide a more detailed concentration map of nutritive salts and while elucidating their temporal changes over sparsely spaced data areas. In the space-time models by ordinary kriging, on the other hand, smooth trends are obvious.

AB  - One reach of a northern California stream, burned by intense wildfire in 1979, was studied to monitor changes and recovery from the fire. Benthic macroinvertebrates collected three weeks and one to four, six, eight, and 11 years following the wildfire were used to assess stream condition and compared to samples from a reach of a nearby unburned stream. Transportable sediment was measured 11 years following the fire. The fire was also used as a worst case example to compare results with a standard cumulative watershed effects assessment methodology.
   Benthic invertebrate density and taxa richness of the burned reach were both low compared to the unburned reach three weeks after the fire. Mean density was significantly higher in the burned reach in the three years following the fire, while taxa richness was significantly lower in the burned reach over the same time period. Higher density and lower richness in the burned reaches persisted throughout the study period but were not significant after three years. Mean Shannon diversity of the burned reach was significantly lower than that of the unburned reach for each year of the study, although absolute differences diminished throughout the 11-year study period.
   Transportable sediment was significantly higher in the burned reach than the unburned comparison. Pearson correlations between sediment and biological metrics were weak. Although the correlation between invertebrate diversity and a measure of watershed disturbance (equivalent roaded acres) was high (r = 0.95) for the burned watershed, the measure appeared to be a poor indicator of cumulative effects on stream condition. The measure (ERA) was poorly correlated with invertebrate diversity in the unburned reach and, while the ERA calculations indicated substantial recovery, biological and physical measures indicated recovery of the burned stream reach was incomplete.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) fertilisation is the main agronomic practice that affects rice yield and quality; similarly, its mismanagement can affect both economic and environmental aspects of crop production. Therefore, it is highly important to direct N fertilisation during the critical growth stages of rice development using vegetation indices (VIs). To this end, a two-year experiment was conducted in 2014 and 2015 in Castello d'Agogna (PV), northwest Italy. The study had three aims: i) establish the best N fertilisation management in temperate rice cropping systems, in terms of total N supply and splitting, to maximise crop yield and N apparent recovery (AR); ii) evaluate the capability of crop N status indicators (CNSIs) measured at panicle initiation stage (PI) to determine grain yield; iii) derive N-fertiliser_rate_at_PI = f(CNSI) from a field trial to attain specific yield goals.
   Results obtained for Centauro variety suggested that to maximise yield while avoiding AR reduction, a low dose of about 50 kg N ha(-1) should be supplied during early growth, then increased at PI. In addition, the final topdressing fertilisation can compensate for any previous stage supply deficiency and can be determined from VI measurements. Findings also identified the normalised difference red edge (NDRE) index as the best VI to determine rice N status in specific agro-environmental conditions. SPAD and NDVI values measured with Rapid Scan can be used to determine N fertilisation at PI, although such measurements require correction through Sufficiency Indices (SIs) calculated as the ratio between VI measurements and VI values of a well-N fertilised plot. The trial also demonstrated that plots supplied with N amounts of 140 kg N ha(-1) (pre-sowing and tillering stages combined) can serve as reference plots for SI calculation that allows to consider the effect of weather and soil variability on VI measurements. A notable exception to this finding was NDVI measured with GreenSeeker, which showed limited ability to assess rice N status under study environmental conditions. Indeed, both VI and the derived SI were influenced by seasonal and soil fertility conditions.
   Finally, a specific statistical method to derive calibration functions for variable rate application fertiliser spreaders from a suitable experiment was defined. These functions will establish the N amount to be supplied at PI related to the CNSI measure. For each CNSI, a specific slope of the calibration function is determined while the intercept is varied depending on the grain yield goal. The higher the acceptable reduction relative to the maximum obtainable yield, the lower the N supply required at PI.

AB  - Under unpredictable climatic scenarios, drought is one of the major environmental constraints limiting plant growth and productivity in arid and semi-arid regions. Rapid recovery from drought is of paramount importance for the persistence and survival of different crops growing worldwide. The boiling soluble proteins, BSPs (proteins remaining soluble upon boiling in aqueous solution) forms an instrumental part of the response to water deficit conditions and might be of key importance for the survival of plants under unfavourable environmental conditions. These BSPs are typified by two unique properties: high hydrophilicity and high thermal stability. The main objective of the study was to determine drought-induced changes in the markers of oxidative stress along with modulation in the activity of the boiling soluble antioxidants in response to different stress regimes followed by re-watering in Triticum aestivum L. In this study, we determined the indices of oxidative stress (membrane injury index (MII) and lipid peroxidation in terms of malondialdehyde (MDA) content) and activities of boiling soluble antioxidant enzymes in seeds of sensitive and tolerant cultivars of wheat at different duration of stress (3, 6 and 10 days) followed by recovery (post stress harvest). Water content recorded a decline in the sensitive (PBW 343 and PBW 621) as well as tolerant (PBW 527 and PBW 175) cultivars in stress duration and cultivar dependent manner and this was reversed following re-watering in all the cultivars. Oxidative stress indicators also increased in all the cultivars at different stress intensities but this was reversed following re-watering in the tolerant cvs. PBW 175 and PBW 527. At 3 and 6 days, boiling soluble monodehydroascorbate reductase (BsMDAR), boiling soluble protein disulphide isomerase (BsPDI) activity increased in both the tolerant cvs. PBW 175 and PBW 527 whereas boiling soluble guaiacol peroxidase (BsGPX) increased in the sensitive cv. PBW 343. However, as the stress intensity increased to 10 days, BsMDAR, boiling soluble glutathione-S-transferase (BsGST) and BsGPX increased only in the tolerant cvs. PBW 175 and PBW 527, thus accentuating their cardinal roles in stress tolerance under harsh drought conditions. Upon re-watering the stress plants after 10 days, BsMDAR increased only in the tolerant cv. PBW 175. On the other hand, boiling soluble protein disulphide isomerase (BsPDI) increased in both the tolerant cv. PBW 175 and susceptible cv. PBW 343, but with a greater enhancement in the cv. PBW 175. Based upon our results, biochemical significance of the boiling soluble antioxidants in the cultivars of wheat differing in drought resistance during different stress intensities and recovery is discussed.

AB  - Atlantic salmon farmed in seacage facilities are exposed to changing environmental conditions. While growth decline under lower water temperatures are reasonably well understood, the mechanisms behind production decline under high water temperatures are yet to be well elucidated and have been hampered by a lack of data describing pre- and postprandial patterns of endocrine fluctuation. The present research therefore aims to determine whether peak nutrient flux into the blood plasma is the most appropriate time point to investigate the endocrine regulation of growth and appetite under conditions of normal and high temperature, and to investigate the interrelationship between appetite and growth on a pre- and post-prandial time scale. Two experiments are presented which examine ghrelin (GHRL) as an indicator of appetite stimulation, the GH-IGF (growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor) system to describe growth-regulating processes and free amino acids (FAA) to indicate postprandial nutrient influx and link appetite and anabolic processes. Postprandial sampling of plasma and white muscle tissue from short-term adapted postsmolt was conducted at 13 degrees C and 19 degrees C at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 hours (h). The same samples were taken from long-term adapted big salmon at 12 degrees C, -4, -2, -1, 0 h pre-prandially and 2, 3, 4 and 6 h post-prandially. While limited relationship between plasma ghrelin concentration and meal times was found for short term adapted postsmolt, clear ghrelin peaks were described for long term adapted salmon prior to the timing of anticipated meals. Possible explanations and consequences to experimental design in this area will be discussed. Postprandial FAA in plasma and white muscle from postsmolt was reduced at 19 degrees C compared to 13 degrees C and plasma levels peaked 8 h post-prandially. Muscle Igf1 mRNA expression levels were consistently higher at 13 degrees C than 19 degrees C, with no clear postprandial patters. In contrast, plasma IGF-1 concentration was relatively constant over time at 12 degrees C and 13 degrees C, but significantly declined from 20 h postprandially at 19 degrees C. GH receptor (ghr1) mRNA expression in muscle was unaffected by temperature, peaking 4 h post-prandially at both temperatures. This paper describes growth and appetite-regulating processes under conditions of normal and elevated temperature for Atlantic salmon, which is fundamental to our understanding of growth limitations inherent to high water temperature situations.

AB  - Given the changing market conditions and uncertainty arising from climate change, forest management tends to focus on the financial functioning of forest holdings. The objective of this work is to study the financial performance of forest districts using ratio analysis, synthetic financial indicators, as well as the relationship between synthetic indicators and forest district categories defined in terms of forest site type, site fertility, compatibility stand species composition, species composition, harvesting system, harvesting intensity, fragmentation of forest complexes and management difficulty level. The study material consists of financial documentation from 82 forest districts of the State Forests National Forest Holding (SFNFH) in eastern Poland from the years 2015-2019 and 2005-2009 (for comparison purposes). Synthetic indicators were calculated using two sets of financial ratios as well as two variants of accounting data. In the study period, forest districts were found to differ in terms of their financial performance, which was affected by the natural and economic factors. The synthetic indicators were significantly higher (p > 0.05) for forest districts operating on low-fertility lowland sites, those managing stands with dominant pine, and those implementing a clearcutting regeneration system. The findings concerning the effects of selected natural and economic factors on the financial condition of forest districts may be used for financial planning and management by SFNFH, in particular in decision-making processes to optimize forest management. The applied methods may stand as a basis for the construction of a sectoral evaluation tool.

AB  - Regardless of the microbiological status of an animal facility, research animals may experience health problems, leading to pain, suffering and distress. Simple and efficient tools are needed to collect data systematically, allowing researchers to react and resolve animals' health issues. We have developed a real-time notification method for recording clinical observations, which caretakers can input into the ELLI record-keeping system, accompanied by a picture or video. A browser-based interface system sends alerts using a three-tier scale (+, 120 hours; ++, 72 hours; +++, 24 hours) by email and/or SMS. The percentage of animal health notifications for rodents was 1.31% in 2016, 1.33% in 2017 and 1.58% in 2018, with 34-44% for coat and skin conditions (wounds, bites and scratches). All other notifications, including environment and behaviour, procedure-specific indicators (weight loss, bleeding and abnormal secretions) and other abnormalities such as eye and teeth malformations, ranged from 5% to 10% during the three-year period. Researchers displayed good compliance by reacting to the notifications within the expected time frame. Most health notifications concerned genetically modified (GM) animals without a predetermined harmful phenotype, regardless of being on project licence or maintenance licence. Health notification records may be useful retrospectively not only to review the health and welfare issues of new GM lines but also to evaluate the actual severity of procedures. The health notification system described here provides valuable information to the veterinarian and the animal welfare body by helping to address specific health conditions and to improve animal welfare and implement the 3Rs.

AB  - Regarding the significant impact of thermal comfort on users' attendance in urban parks, there is an intense interest in studies on the outdoor thermal comfort in parks especially in regions with hot summers. This research examines the determinant factors of thermal environment and also strategies related to albedo and greenery in a medium-scale park using ENVI-met software. In this regard, the environmental situation is analyzed using air (Ta) and surface temperature (Ts), wind speed (WS), sky view factor (SVF), the mean radiant temperature (MRT), and physiological equivalent temperature (PET). Subsequently, low- and high-albedo pavements, plane and pine trees, and Buxus shrubs strategies are investigated that can significantly influence the parameters. According to the results, SVF is not a precise indicator for determining radiation exposure and thermal comfort conditions despite its wide application in previous studies. Further, there is a significant correlation between SVF and PET only during sunlight and sunset. In addition, the best thermal comfort condition can be reached by combining the low-albedo pavements, and trees with wide crowns and high trunks. The crown height from the ground is an important factor due to its effect on the airflow that can also counteract the impact of slightly increased radiation. Field investigation and simulation studies reveal that the effect of albedo on thermal comfort is lower than the vegetation coverage. Nevertheless, the significant changes in albedo values and urban heat island mitigation do not have any considerable effect on thermal comfort improvement in urban parks. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - In the last decade, the sanitation service chain model has become thede factoframework for much research and development in urban non-networked sanitation. People, their priorities and urban ways of living, as well as the conditions that underpin sustainable services, are too often overlooked in current conceptualizations of urban sanitation service delivery. This paper suggests that, as the sector moves toward a new paradigm of Citywide Inclusive Urban Sanitation, it is timely to revisit the conceptual framing of urban sanitation. The Sanitation Cityscape is a conceptual framework for citywide urban sanitation. It identifies the key factors of urban sanitation and locates those within a framework using three conceptual environments: TheLiving Environment, theService Delivery Environment, and theEnabling Environment.Using a proposed set of 16 indicators and locating existing tools (for example, the Living Conditions Diamond, the fecal flow diagram, and the Citywide Service Delivery Assessment), the framework looks beyond the linear framing of sanitation services to gain a better understanding of the surrounding context and externalities. For the researcher and practitioner alike, we suggest that the Sanitation Cityscape can provide a coherent "frame" to locate the components of the urban sanitation puzzle predictably and systematically. It lends itself to rapid diagnostic analysis and more appropriate targeting of appropriate sanitation interventions. The paper includes insights from application of the Sanitation Cityscape framework including moving toward an outcome-based sanitation service delivery model, efficiencies in data collection, creating area typologies to align sanitation responses, setting enabling environment analyses boundaries purposefully and intentionally, and identifying key interfaces as potential intervention points or system levers. We hope that the Sanitation Cityscape might provide a foundation for greater consistency and a common vocabulary around the fundamental concepts and indicators relevant to urban sanitation.

AB  - This study explores whether child growth has signalled periods of social change between the Medieval Islamic and post-Islamic Christian Periods in Santarem, Portugal. The social change is associated with the Christian conquest of Iberia and the fall of the Islamic Empire in Europe, which ceased the regional influence of the Golden Age of Islam. This may have caused a deterioration in living conditions brought by the Christian conquest, compared with the social improvements brought by the Medieval Islamic Empire. Forty-two juvenile skeletons were taken from three Medieval Islamic and three Late Medieval Christian sites excavated in the city of Santarem, Portugal. Age was estimated from tooth length. Linear growth for all long bones and appositional growth of the femur midshaft were compared with expected growth from the Denver Growth Study, using z scores. Significant growth deficit was found throughout the Medieval Islamic and Christian Periods in Santarem, as well as a deficit in apposition of cortical bone. Although children in the post-Islamic Christian period showed a trend towards greater linear and appositional growth deficits, these differences were not statistically significant. Children in Medieval Islamic and Late Medieval Christian Periods show significant growth disruption, suggesting that in Santarem, the post-Islamic Medieval Christian period may not have witnessed a decrease in living conditions after the fall of Islamic rule in the territory. Further studies that incorporate more samples from the Islamic and Post-Islamic Periods as well as pre-Islamic population samples are needed to explore the possibility that the Islamic Period was more favourable for child growth.

AB  - Palm oil mill effluent (POME) is a highly polluted agro-industrial wastewater. The CO2 in industrial flue gas requires treatment before it can be discharged into the environment. Utilizing microalgae as the agent to treat wastewater and industrial flue gas is a waste-to-wealth approach. The resulting biomass can be commercialized in the form of valuable products. Chlorella sp. is a microalgal species that can tolerate the pollutant load and has been proven to be a suitable species for CO2 fixation. In this study, Chlorella sp. was cultivated in POME with the aim of reducing the pollutants in the POME and simultaneously capturing CO2. The optimization of the operational conditions of this microalgae-based treatment system was carried out using the response surface methodology (RSM) face centered-central composite design (FC-CCD). Operational factors include the air concentration of CO2 (10-25% v/v), the inlet gas flow rate of 500-2000 mL min(-1), and initial inoculum concentration (10-30% v/v) of Chlorella sp. cultivated in POME. The target deliverables include the maximum amount of CO2 fixed by Chlorella sp. and the total nitrogen (TN) reduction as indicators of pollutant reduction by this treatment system. We found that a limited supply of CO2 caused growth limitation, while excess CO2 resulted in acid production that triggered microalgae growth inhibition. The optimum operational conditions were 10% v/v CO2, 1670 mL min(-1) aeration rate, and 24.8% v/v inoculum concentration, predicted to simultaneously fix CO2 at 0.12 g of CO2 L-1 day(-1) and reduce 80.9% TN, respectively.

AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate the use of torasemide as a highly sensitive indicator substance and to develop a formulation thereof for establishing quantitative relationships between hot-melt extrusion process conditions and critical quality attributes (CQAs). Using solid-state characterization techniques and a 10 mm lab-scale co-rotating twin-screw extruder, we studied torasemide in a SoluplusA (R) A (SOL)-polyethylene glycol 1500 (PEG 1500) matrix, and developed and characterized a formulation which was used as a process indicator to study thermal- and hydrolysis-induced degradation, as well as residual crystallinity. We found that torasemide first dissolved into the matrix and then degraded. Based on this mechanism, extrudates with measurable levels of degradation and residual crystallinity were produced, depending strongly on the main barrel and die temperature and residence time applied. In addition, we found that 10% w/w PEG 1500 as plasticizer resulted in the widest operating space with the widest range of measurable residual crystallinity and degradant levels. Torasemide as an indicator substance behaves like a challenging-to-process API, only with higher sensitivity and more pronounced effects, e.g., degradation and residual crystallinity. Application of a model formulation containing torasemide will enhance the understanding of the dynamic environment inside an extruder and elucidate the cumulative thermal and hydrolysis effects of the extrusion process. The use of such a formulation will also facilitate rational process development and scaling by establishing clear links between process conditions and CQAs.

AB  - EM (effective microorganism) technique has been widely used in environmental protection field, while its application in the improvement of agricultural soil was seldom studied. In this study, EM was used to ferment the EM organic fertilizers, and these fertilizers were applied to the tomato cultivated soils under the greenhouse condition. Isolation layers were buried into the soils with different depths of 20 cm (D1), 30 cm (D2) and 40 cm (D3). The application amounts of organic fertilizer were 2800 kg/ha (F1), 3600 kg/ha (F2) and 4400 kg/ha (F3), respectively. The soil salt content, the available nutrient concentrations, as well as the physical indicators of the greenhouse soil were observed. Results showed that compared to CK, the treatments reduced the salinity of soil in plough layer by 7.7-39.2%. The salt removing effect is the most satisfactory when the EM organic fertilization amount was 3600 kg/ha. The treatments increased the soil organic matter content by 4.7-22.9% and field capacity by 3.4-18.8%, in comparison to CK. However, the soil available N, P and K concentrations were decreased by 4.418.4%, 5.4-23.7% and 5.3-16.2%, respectively, under different treatments. The buried depth of straw layer had no obvious effects on soil physical indicators and available nutrient concentrations. Our results suggested that the EM organic fertilizer application could create a better growth environment for crops when compared to inorganic fertilization. From the perspective of soil improvement, 3600 kg/ha of organic fertilizer application amount combined with 30 cm buried depth of straw layer was recommended.

AB  - Inter-annual variations of atmospheric isoprene in a major metropolis, Taipei, were reported based on a two-year continuous measurements of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) with an hourly resolution. It is by far the largest dataset ever collected in the urban subtropical environment with thriving vegetation and traffic flows. The dataset revealed the detailed interplay between the two major sources of biogenic and vehicular throughout the year. To separate the vehicular contribution from the biogenic one for the ambient isoprene, ethylene was used as an indicator of traffic emissions. While dramatic surge of isoprene was observed at noontime in hot months with the highest average peak mixing ratio of 1.6 ppbv in August, its abundance decreased to 0.2 ppbv on average in cold months. The vehicular contribution to ambient isoprene was largely masked over by the noontime surge of isoprene in hot seasons, but was still able to be vaguely observed on the slopes of the isoprene peaks mimicking the rush-hour features of ethylene. In winter, the diurnal variations of isoprene were very similar to those of ethylene, which suggests that ambient isoprene in cold months was almost of traffic origin.
   This study based on the continuous dataset could enhance the key findings in previous flask studies in the same metropolis. While canister sampling had a major advantage of area coverage, the highly time-resolved fixed-site monitoring could better reveal the evolution process from a biogenically overwhelmed condition in hot months to the condition where the biogenic source weakened to reveal the traffic source in cold months.

AB  - The shallow marine shales of the Cretaceous formations namely Yolde, Dukul, Jessu, Sekuliye and Numanha ranging in age from Cenomanian to Coniacian within the Yola Sub-basin in the Northern Benue Trough, northeastern Nigeria were analysed to provide an overview on their hydrocarbon generation potential. This study is based on pyrolysis analysis, total organic carbon content (TOC), extractable organic matter (EOM), biomarker distributions and measured vitrinite reflectance. The present-day TOC contents range between 0.24 and 0.71 wt. % and Hydrogen Index (HI) values between 8.7 and 113 mg HC/g TOC with Type III/IV kerogens. Based on the present-day kerogen typing, the shale sediments are expected to generate mainly gas. Biomarker compositions indicates deposition in a marine environment under suboxic conditions with prevalent contribution of aquatic organic matter and a significant amount of terrigenous organic matter input Organic matter that is dominated by marine components contains kerogens of Type II and Type This study shows that the organic matter has been affected by volcanic intrusion and consequently, have reached post-mature stage of oil generation. These higher thermal maturities levels are consistent with the vitrinite reflectance ranging from 0.85 to 2.35 Ro % and high T-max (440-508 degrees C) values as supported by biomarker maturity ratios. Based on this study, a high prospect for major gas and minor oil generation potential is anticipated from the shallow marine Cretaceous formations from Yola Sub-basin. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land-use intensification is a key driver of biodiversity change. However, little is known about how it alters relationships between the diversities of different taxonomic groups, which are often correlated due to shared environmental drivers and trophic interactions. Using data from 150 grassland sites, we examined how land-use intensification (increased fertilization, higher livestock densities, and increased mowing frequency) altered correlations between the species richness of 15 plant, invertebrate, and vertebrate taxa. We found that 54% of pairwise correlations between taxonomic groups were significant and positive among all grasslands, while only one was negative. Higher land-use intensity substantially weakened these correlations(35% decrease in rand 43% fewer significant pairwise correlations at high intensity), a pattern which may emerge as a result of biodiversity declines and the breakdown of specialized relationships in these conditions. Nevertheless, some groups (Coleoptera, Heteroptera, Hymenoptera and Orthoptera) were consistently correlated with multidiversity, an aggregate measure of total biodiversity comprised of the standardized diversities of multiple taxa, at both high and lowland-use intensity. The form of intensification was also important; increased fertilization and mowing frequency typically weakened plant-plant and plant-primary consumer correlations, whereas grazing intensification did not. This may reflect decreased habitat heterogeneity under mowing and fertilization and increased habitat heterogeneity under grazing. While these results urge caution in using certain taxonomic groups to monitor impacts of agricultural management on biodiversity, they also suggest that the diversities of some groups are reasonably robust indicators of total biodiversity across a range of conditions.

AB  - Several international studies have shown that traffic noise has a negative impact on people's health and that people's annoyance does not depend only on noise energetic levels, but rather on multi-perceptual factors. The combination of virtual reality technology and audio rendering techniques allow us to experiment a new approach for environmental noise assessment that can help to investigate in advance the potential negative effects of noise associated with a specific project and that in turn can help designers to make educated decisions. In the present study, the audio-visual impact of a new motorway project on people has been assessed by means of immersive virtual reality technology. In particular, participants were exposed to 3D reconstructions of an actual landscape without the projected motorway (ante operam condition), and of the same landscape with the projected motorway (post operam condition). Furthermore, individuals' reactions to noise were assessed by means of objective cognitive measures (short term verbal memory and executive functions) and subjective evaluations (noise and visual annoyance). Overall, the results showed that the introduction of a projected motorway in the environment can have immediate detrimental effects of people's well-being depending on the distance from the noise source. In particular, noise due to the new infrastructure seems to exert a negative influence on short term verbal memory and to increase both visual and noise annoyance. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of large wood (LW) on the physical environment and the initial establishment of vascular plant species in the Rekifune River, a large bar-braided monsoonal river in Japan. The physical environment and the diversity and composition of plant species were compared in relation to the orientation of LW pieces. We found that shading effects were more prevalent in the immediate vicinity of LW pieces than in quadrats distant from LW. The effect was especially strong at the center of LW jams (the "jam center"). Fine sand and silt were concentrated in the quadrats downstream from the LW pieces. In contrast, cobbles dominated the upstream quadrats. The highest diversity was found in the jam center, while intermediate values were observed in the quadrats surrounding LW. Indicator species analysis detected 21 indicator species only in the jam center. The LW jams favored the deposition of plant fragments and sediment and created shaded areas within and around the structures. Buried seeds may be transported with LW during a flood, and seeds dispersed by wind and stream flows may be trapped by the complex structure of LW jams. The specific environmental conditions and the trapping of seeds and plant fragments result in the early establishment of mid-successional tree species at LW jams. In conclusion, the LW pieces deposited on gravel bars altered the light and substrate conditions and thereby provided specific safe sites for various riparian plant species.

AB  - Definition of the problem Health inequalities are unintended consequences of the ways how social life and the economy are organized. Ways of living and individual preferences are also determining health inequalities, irrespective of whether being deliberate or imposed. Health inequalities have been reported for nearly all countries, for which data are available. These manifest in many different ways and over the whole life course for the most frequently occurring diseases. Arguments Usually social differentiation is conceptualized by using education, occupational position, and income. The relative effect magnitudes vary according to the type of health impairment considered. All indicators more or less depict control, i.e., opportunities for exercising influence and to participate. Control is a core construct of social psychological conceptions of distress. Beyond proximate effects of the social structure, recent studies are focussed on the life course. If pregnant women are exposed to distress or deprivation, the unborn child may experience impairments or may develop vulnerabilities to disease, if these effects occur during sensitive developmental periods. This "model of sensitive periods" is complemented by the "model of cumulative exposures". The latter implies that disadvantageous conditions may accumulate over the life course and may be associated with increased disease susceptibility. Conclusion In order to reduce health inequalities, measures may be directed toward behavioral changes and living conditions, or they may include changes of laws. Changes of behavior will occur at different paces, varying readiness, and openness for change-depending on educational level. This will result in time-lagged effects entailing increasing health disparities, at least in the short term.

AB  - Specific leaf area (SLA) is an important plant functional trait as it is an indicator of ecophysiological characteristics like relative growth rate, stress tolerance and leaf longevity. Substantial intraspecific variation in SLA is common and usually correlates with environmental conditions. For instance, SLA decreases with increasing altitude, which is understood as adjustment to temperature. It is generally assumed that intraspecific variation is mostly the result of environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity, but genetic effects may also be present, due to local adaptation or genetic drift. In this study, genotypic and environmental effects on SLA were experimentally separated for the widespread Alpine bell flower Campanula thyrsoides by transplanting plants to three common gardens at contrasting altitudes (600, 1,235 and 1,850 m a.s.l.). Seeds were sampled from 18 populations in four phylogeographic regions within the European Alps. A strong plastic response was observed: SLA decreased with increasing altitude of the common gardens (22.0% of variation). The phylogeographic regions were differentiated in SLA in the common gardens (10.1% of variation), indicating that SLA is at least partly genetically determined. Plants from the six easternmost populations experienced a submediterranean climate and showed decreased SLA values in the three common gardens compared to populations to the west, which may be explained as adaptation to drought. Within these submediterranean populations, SLA decreased with altitude of origin in two out of three common gardens. Concluding, SLA shows strong phenotypic plasticity as well as substantial genetic effects, the latter probably being the result of adaptation to local conditions rather than genetic drift.

AB  - The length of time between harvest and the onset of the climacteric rise in fruit respiration depends both on the harvest stage and the storage conditions of mango fruit (Mangifera indica cv Cogshall). We therefore propose classifying fruit according to a Ripening class index (Rci) that takes both storage time and climacteric stage into account. Batches of fruit thus obtained are more homogeneous than those sorted according to their storage time or their climacteric stage alone, as shown by the lowest root mean square error values obtained for the majority of the physico-chemical criteria measured, such as total soluble sugars, starch, and total soluble solids contents, titratable acidity, pH, firmness and the ratio of total soluble sugars to total organic acids. The advantage of this classification system for monitoring postharvest changes in mangoes stored at 12 or 20 degrees C has been demonstrated. The Rci was used to study the impact of agronomic conditions such as the leaf-to-fruit ratio and harvest stage on the changes in physicochemical criteria traditionally used as quality descriptors. Sugar content increases with the increase in carbon supply and the harvest stage, whereas the titratable acidity and the hue angle decrease during ripening. This type of index can be used to validate the relevance of harvest indicators by verifying the homogeneity of the changes in stored batches or for more effectively assessing the impact of a storage technique on fruit metabolism.

AB  - Emergency departments (EDs), similar to other health care environments, are concerned with improving the quality of patient care. Older patients comprise a large, growing, and particularly vulnerable subset of ED users. The project objective was to develop ED-specific quality indicators for older patients to help practitioners identify quality gaps and focus quality improvement efforts.
   The Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM) Geriatric Task Force, including members representing the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), selected three conditions where there are quality gaps in the care of older patients: cognitive assessment, pain management, and transitional care in both directions between nursing homes and EDs. For each condition, a content expert created potential quality indicators based on a systematic review of the literature, supplemented with expert opinion when necessary. The original candidate quality indicators were modified in response to evaluation by four groups: the Task Force, the SAEM Geriatric Interest Group, and audiences at the 2007 SAEM Annual Meeting and the 2008 American Geriatrics Society Annual Meeting.
   The authors offer 6 quality indicators for cognitive assessment, 6 for pain management, and 11 for transitions between nursing homes and EDs.
   These quality indicators will help researchers and clinicians target quality improvement efforts. The next steps will be to test the feasibility of capturing the quality indicators in existing medical records and to measure the extent to which each quality indicator is successfully met in current emergency practice.

AB  - The value of intrinsic chlorophyll fluorescence polarization, and the intensity in emission spectrum were investigated in leaf segments of Alocasia macrorrhiza under several stress conditions including different temperatures ( 25 - 50 degrees C), various concentrations of NaCl ( 0 - 250 mM), methyl viologen ( MV, 0 - 25 mu M), SDS ( 0 - 1.0%) and NaHSO3 ( 0 - 80 mu M). Fluorescence emission spectrum of leaves at wavelength regions of 500 - 800 nm was monitored by excitation at 436 nm. The value of fluorescence polarization ( P value), as result of energy transfer and mutual orientation between chlorophyll molecules, was determined by excitation at 436 nm and emission at 685 nm. The results showed that elevated temperature and concentrations of salt ( NaCl), photooxidant ( MV), surfactant ( SDS) and simulated SO2 ( NaHSO3) treatments all induced a reduction of fluorescence polarization to various degrees. However, alteration of the fluorescence spectrum and emission intensity of F-685 and F-731 depended on the individual treatment. Increase in temperature and concentration of NaHSO3 enhanced fluorescence intensity mainly at F-685, while an increase in MV concentration led to a decrease at both F-685 and F-731. On the contrary, NaCl and SDS did not cause remarkable change in fluorescence spectrum. Among different treatments, the negative correlation between polarization and fluorescence intensity was found with NaHSO3 treatments only. We concluded that P value being measured with intrinsic chlorophyll fluorescence as probe in leaves is a susceptible indicator responding to changes in environmental conditions. The alteration of P value and fluorescence intensity might not always be shown a functional relation pattern. The possible reasons of differed response to various treatments were discussed.

AB  - The enantiomeric composition of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) atropisomers, including PCB 95, PCB 149 and PCB 132, was measured in 11 livers of harbour porpoises ( Phocoena phocoena) from the southern North Sea. Non-racemic enantiomeric ratios (ERs) were found in some samples. The value of ERs in three of the four juvenile porpoises was equal or almost equal to one, while the ERs in all adults differed from racemic and ranged from 1.31 to 2.54 for PCB 95; from 1.19 to 1.81 for PCB 149 and from 0.45 to 0.94 for PCB 132. There were no relationships between the total concentration of PCBs and ERs. To understand the phenomena, the relationships between the ER value of individual chiral congener with age, concentration of total PCBs and PCB congener pattern were discussed. A model of intake and elimination kinetics was set up and it was tested using the ratio between concentration of PCB 153 and PCB 101 in the liver samples. There was a clear trend between the enantiomeric ratios and the ratio between PCB 153 and PCB 101. Considering that PCB 153 is one of the most persistent PCB congeners in marine mammals and PCB 101 is a relatively easy metabolised congener, this trend means that the enantiomeric ratio most likely reflects the proportion of the metabolised congener. The exposure period in contaminated conditions has a strong impact on ERs, and it is suggested that ERs in wildlife, combined with information on their anthropometric data, health status, diet and habitat conditions, might be good indicators of pollution in coastal ecosystems.

AB  - Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) eggs and chick feathers were collected for mercury analysis from nests at four Great Lakes study areas in Ontario (three "naturally formed" lakes in southern Ontario and one reservoir in northern Ontario) and two New Jersey study areas in 1991-1994. Adult osprey feathers were sampled from three Great Lakes study areas in 1991. Feathers sampled from chicks (approximately 28-35 days old) appear to be better indicators of local contaminant conditions since spatial patterns of mercury in known prey, yellow perch (Perca flavescens), also collected in these areas, were more similar to chick feathers than to eggs. Mercury levels were less variable in chick feathers than in eggs. Estimates of biomagnification factors using prey of known size at these areas were also less variable in feathers than in eggs. At naturally formed lakes, no significant correlation in mercury levels between eggs and chick feathers from the same nest was apparent, suggesting that the source of mercury contamination was not the same in these two tissues: mercury levels in eggs reflect mercury acquired on the breeding grounds, wintering grounds, and migratory route; mercury levels in chick feathers reflect local dietary conditions on the breeding grounds. Mercury levels in both osprey eggs and chick feathers were higher at the Ogoki Reservoir than at naturally formed lakes. Adult osprey feathers had higher mercury concentrations than chick feathers. Mercury levels in osprey eggs, chick feathers, and adult feathers did not approach levels associated with toxic reproductive effects.

AB  - Previous studies of microbial behaviour in situ have used dialysis sacs and diffusion chambers to permit contact of contained microorganisms with the external aqueous milieu. Their main limitation is a slow response to changes in water quality, preventing adequate simulation of field conditions. This study used the ECODYNE system(TM), a new device responsive to real time changes in water quality. It consists of a hollow fibre membrane module and fluid reservoir which separates the test microorganisms from the external environment. Use of a mixture of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus durans, MS-2 phage, poliovirus type 1 (Sabin) and hepatitis A virus (HM-175) allowed direct comparison of their survival in river water under identical conditions over a period of at least 24 hours. The results can be summarised as follows: a) survival patterns of E. coli in nutrient rich river water were highly variable, b) a ten-fold or greater increase in numbers of E. coli was sometimes observed in both laboratory and field tests, c) no regrowth was ever observed with E. durans, and its titre declined faster than that of E. coli, and d) over the first 24 hours, the phage survival was similar to that of the human pathogenic viruses. The observations regarding the variable survival of E. coli and its potential for regrowth raise questions about its suitability as a water quality indicator. MS-2 phage shows promise as an indicator of viral pollution, but requires further study. The ECODYNE system proved highly suitable in this study, and shows potential for other environmental interaction/environmental fate studies including ecotoxicological investigations and monitoring.

AB  - We present the description and interpretation of a James Ross Island Volcanic Group (JRIVG) succession around the Cerro Domo and Ventisqueros Mesa area. Our aim is to reconstruct the volcanic evolution and provide new palaeoenvironmental information for the northwest sector of James Ross Island, northern Antarctic Peninsula. We present representative stratigraphic logs that are combined with new chronological constraints provided by Ar-40/Ar-39 ages and Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope analyses that demonstrate a record of the late Miocene to earliest Pleistocene. The first volcanic activity registered is associated with tuff cone deposits that resulted from marine hydromagmatic eruptions, close to 6.18 +/- 0.14 Ma. Subsequently, lodgement till deposits record a grounded glacial advance. Overlying the glacigenic deposits, fossil-bearing sediments record a marine or glacimarine environment following the ice sheet retreat, and an Sr-87/Sr-86 age of 6.02 (+0.09, -0.09) Ma dates ice-poor conditions. A lava-fed delta system, which yields an age of 5.37 +/- 0.12 Ma, prograded over the previous deposits. Stacked pillow lavas, curvy columnar-jointed basalts and subaerial tabular lavas, with a 4.9 +/- 0.10 Ma age, were emplaced after the lava-fed delta deposition. Another lava-fed delta located to the north of the previously volcanic units yielded an age of 3.57 +/- 0.19 Ma. A glacial pavement carved into the top of these deposits records a second ice advance in the area. The final volcanic activity emplaced Cerro Domo, a large volcanic edifice which was the centre of explosive hydromagmatic eruptions. The presence of pristine, articulated bivalves in life position within the lower volcanic deposits of Cerro Domo, together with an Sr-87/Sr-86 age of 3.16 (+0.59, -0.43) Ma, are strong indicators of a marine environment and suggest ice-poor "interglacial" conditions at this time. Dykes cutting the volcanic deposits of Cerro Domo and considered coeval with the eruptions afford ages of 2.62 +/- 0.08 and 2.72 +/- 0.09 Ma. Our results provide new insights on the volcanic and glaciation history of James Ross Island, as well as supporting marine, ice-poor conditions around similar to 6 Ma, and near or right before the Plio-Pleistocene boundary, between similar to 3.2 and similar to 2.6 Ma.

AB  - Maximum daily trunk shrinkage (MDS) is the most popular indicator derived from trunk diameter fluctuations in most fruit trees and has been reported to be one of the earliest signs in the detection of water stress. However, in some species such as olive trees (Olea europaea L.), MDS does not usually change in water stress conditions and trunk growth rate (TGR) has been suggested as better indicator. Most of this lack of sensitivity to drought conditions has been related to the relationship between the MDS and the water potential. This curvilinear relationship produces an uncertain zone were great variations of water potential do not imply any changes of MDS. The MDS signal, the ratio between measured MDS and estimated MDS with full irrigation, has been thought to be a better indicator than MDS, as it reduces the effect of the environment.. On the other hand, though literature results suggest an effect of environment in TGR values, there are not clear relationship between this indicator and meteorological data. The aims of this work are, on one hand, to study the improvements of the baseline approach in the MDS signal and, on the other, study the influence of several meteorological variables in TGR. Three years' data from an irrigation experiment were used in to carry out the MDS analysis and six years' data for full irrigated trees during pit hardening period were used for TGR study. The comparison between MDS vs. water potential and MDS signal vs. water potential presented a great scattering in both relationships. Values of MDS signal between 1.1 and 1.4 were always identified with moderate water stress conditions (-1.4 to -2 MPa of water potential). However, since this MDS signal values are around the maximum in the curvilineal relationship with water potential, greater values of MDS signal (in the range of 1.1-1.4) were not necessary lower values of water potential. In addition, during low fruit load seasons MDS signal was not an accurate indicator. On the other hand, absolute values of several climatological measurements were not significantly related with TGR. Only daily increments explain part of the variations of TGR in full irrigated trees. In all the data analysed, the daily increment of average vapour pressure deficit was the best indicator related with TGR. The increase of this indicator decreased TGR values. In addition, the agreement between this indicator and TGR was affected for fruit load. Great yield seasons decrease the influence of VPD increment in TGR. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A performance-based method for evaluating methane (CH4) oxidation as the best available control technology (BACT) for passive management of landfill gas (LFG) was applied at a municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill in central Washington, USA, to predict when conditions for functional stability with respect to LFG management would be expected. The permitted final cover design at the subject landfill is an all-soil evapotranspirative (ET) cover system. Using a model, a correlation between CH4 loading flux and oxidation was developed for the specific ET cover design. Under Washington's regulations, a MSW landfill is functionally stable when it does not present a threat to human health or the environment (HHE) at the relevant point of exposure (POE), which was conservatively established as the cover surface. Approaches for modeling LFG migration and CH4 oxidation are discussed, along with comparisons between CH4 oxidation and biodegradation of non-CH4 organic compounds (NMOCs). The modeled oxidation capacity of the ET cover design is 15 g/m(2)/day under average climatic conditions at the site, with 100% oxidation expected on an annual average basis for fluxes up to 8 g/m(2)/day. This translates to a sitewide CH4 generation rate of about 260 m(3)/hr, which represents the functional stability target for allowing transition to cover oxidation as the BACT (subject to completion of a confirmation monitoring program). It is recognized that less than 100% oxidation might occur periodically if climate and/or cover conditions do not precisely match the model, but that residual emissions during such events would be de minimis in comparison with published limit values. Accordingly, it is also noted that nonzero net emissions may not represent a threat to HHE at a POE (i.e., a target flux between 8 and 15 g/m(2)/day might be appropriate for functional stability) depending on the site reuse plan and distance to potential receptors. Implications: This study provides a scientifically defensible method for estimating when methane oxidation in landfill cover soils may represent the best available control technology for residual landfill gas (LFG) emissions. This should help operators and regulators agree on the process of safely eliminating active LFG controls in favor of passive control measures once LFG generation exhibits asymptotic trend behavior below the oxidation capacity of the soil. It also helps illustrate the potential benefits of evolving landfill designs to include all-soil vegetated evapotranspirative (ET) covers that meet sustainability objectives as well as regulatory performance objectives for infiltration control.

AB  - Many rangeland streams and associated fisheries have suffered from livestock grazing as a cost of upland-forage utilization. Due to damage from intensive usage, restoration of damaged streams is now a common land-management objective. The Squaw Valley Ranch of Elko County, Nevada, US, in cooperation with the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Barrick Gold Corp., is attempting to improve those portions of the Rock Creek watershed negatively affected by past ranch operations. The watershed includes both historical and occupied habitat for the threatened Lahonton cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi [Richardson]). From 2003, and continuing to the present, hot-season livestock grazing on Squaw Valley Ranch private and permitted public-land riparian areas was greatly reduced. To assess the effectiveness of this conservation effort, we (1) evaluated BLM archived images of riparian photo points in the watershed, (2) tested for change over time using data from systematic, intermittent, aerial sampling that acquired 2-cm resolution images from low-altitude surveys conducted in 2003, 2004 and 2006, and (3) compared Landsat scenes of the area from before and after 2003. Willow (Salix spp.) cover was chosen as the primary ecological indictor of riparian condition and we introduce willow canopy (m(2)) per m of stream length in the image field-of-view, as a practical measure of willow status. Archived images from photo points show mostly low-condition riparian plant communities, often with little or no willow canopy evident before 2003, but with conspicuous improvement thereafter. This subjective perception is supported by objective analyses finding, (1) the relative increase in willow cover nearly tripled on one stream, more than doubled on three others, and increased on all but one (fire affected) and (2) a highly significant post-2003 increase in willows in the Landsat record. Thus, the post-2003 increase in willow cover documented in three complementary lines of evidence from ground, air, and space support the predicted ecological benefits of reduced hot-season riparian grazing and the utility of 2-cm imagery as a tool for assessing watershed-wide conservation benefits from a federal cost-share-eligible conservation practice. This appears to be the first use of willow measurements from an aerial survey as a particular indicator of riparian condition and trend and the first demonstration of change detection based on objective measurements from a watershed-scale riparian monitoring effort that used systematic sampling (versus subjective selection) and high sample density to address the large Type II error (false negative) risk common to conventional land-management survey efforts.

AB  - Working memory (WM) is a strong predictor of academic performance, due to its impact in reading comprehension, arithmetic's competence and the regulated behaviors required for school learning. Thus, knowing about WM operation in school aged children and teachers' perception on their students WM is of great value and interest. This is why in the present work we assess whether teachers' reports about their students' WM (indirect measure) is associated with their performance in WM tasks (direct measure), and also to assess whether the difficulties perceived by the teachers correspond to the presence of students' general behavioral issues. For that, we administered computerized verbal WM tasks to school-aged children, in which they had to recall a number of digits (control condition) while saying out loud the color of the items (interference condition), and computerized visual-spatial WM tasks, in which they had to recall the locations of a series of stimuli (control condition) while indicating the color of the stimuli in a color palette (interference condition). We also administered two scales to their teachers: one of them asks about WM specifically (Working Memory Rating Scale) and is composed of 20 short descriptions of behavior problems that allow discriminating between children with poor and average WM skills. The teacher rates how typical a behavior is in each child, in a scale that goes from Not typical at all (0) to Very typical (3). The other asks about diverse behavioral problems (Guide of Behavioral Observation) and is composed of the following sub-scales: Physical and Verbal Aggression, Negativism, Transgression, Impulsivity, Hyperactivity, Attention Deficit and Acceptance. The teacher must choose the option that best describes the behavior in the child in terms of frequency (Never, Sometimes or Often). Our results show significant associations between children performance in the verbal WM task (direct measure) and WM failures' indicators (indirect measures), which can be explained by the fact that the verbal component is more clearly reflected in the behaviors explored in the Working Memory Rating Scale (e.g., loses his place in complicated activities, requires regular repetition of instructions, depends on neighbor to remind them of the current task). We also wanted to look out if there were associations between the WM skills reported by the teachers and the general behavior problems also reported by them, and we found associations between the reported WM difficulties and attention disorders, hyperactivity and self-aggression. This is consistent with the claim that WM and attention deficit in nonclinical population are closely related. With respect to hyperactivity, its relation with WM is not as clear and has not been so frequently reported. With respect to self-aggression, its relation with WM difficulties can be attributed to these children's inability to exercise control over the environment, which leads to frustration and low levels of motivation and self-esteem. Lastly, we found associations between children's performance in the computerized WM tasks and the presence of behavioral problems informed by the teachers. Specifically, proper performance in verbal WM tasks associates with less attention difficulties, where as proper performance in visual-spatial WM tasks associates with being accepted by the group. This last association could be attributed to the fact that many group games require several abilities that involve visual-spatial WM, such as the ability to orientate in space and recall different locations.
   To conclude, we consider that this work constitutes a contribution because, in the first place, there are no WM observation scales for teachers' use available in our environment, and, in the second place, it addresses the need for teachers to acknowledge WM difficulties and consequently be trained for the implementation of effective strategies to improve WM skills in the classroom.

AB  - A quantitative kinetic model has been proposed to simulate the large D and C-13 isotope enrichments observed in individual n-alkanes (C-13-C-21) during artificial thermal maturation of a North Sea crude oil under anhydrous, closed-system conditions. Under our experimental conditions, average n-alkane delta C-13 values increase by similar to 4 parts per thousand and delta D values increase by similar to 50 parts per thousand at an equivalent vitrinite reflectance value of 1.5%. While the observed 13 C-enrichment shows no significant dependence on hydrocarbon chain length, thermally induced D-enrichment increases with increasing n-alkane carbon number. This differential fractionation effect is speculated to be due to the combined effect of the greater extent of thermal cracking of higher molecular weight, n-alkanes compared to lower molecular weight homologues, and the generation of isotopically lighter, lower molecular weight compounds. This carbon-number-linked hydrogen isotopic fractionation behavior could form the basis of a new maturity indicator to quantitatively assess the extent of oil cracking in petroleum reservoirs. Quantum mechanical calculations of the average change in enthalpy (Delta Delta H-double dagger) and entropy (Delta Delta S-double dagger) as a result of isotopic substitution in n-alkanes undergoing homolytic cleavage of C-C bonds lead to predictions of isotopic fractionation that agree quite well with our experimental results. For n-C-20 (n-icosane), the changes in enthalpy are calculated to be similar to 1340 J mol(-1) (320 cal mol(-1)) and 230 J mol(-1) (55 cal mol(-1)) for D-H and C-13-C-12, respectively. Because the enthalpy term associated with hydrogen isotope fractionation is approximately six times greater than that for carbon, variations in delta D values for individual long-chain hydrocarbons provide a highly sensitive measure of the extent of thermal alteration experienced by the oil. Extrapolation of the kinetic model to typical geological heating conditions predicts significant enrichment in C-13 and D for n-icosane at equivalent vitrinite reflectance values corresponding to the onset of thermal cracking of normal alkanes. The experimental and theoretical results of this study have significant implications for the use of compound-specific hydrogen isotope data in petroleum geochemical and paleoclimatological studies. However, there are many other geochemical processes that will significantly affect observed hydrogen isotopic compositions (e.g., biodegradation, water washing, isotopic exchange with water and minerals) that must also be taken into consideration.

AB  - This study evaluated bioaerosol emissions during land application of Class B biosolids in and around Tucson, Arizona, to aid in developing models of the fate and transport of bioaerosols generated from the land application of biosolids. Samples were collected for 20 min at distances between 2 m and 20 m downwind of point sources, using an SKC BioSampler(R) impinger. A total of six samples were collected per sampling event, which consisted of a biosolid spray applicator applying liquid biosolids to a cotton field. Each application represented one exposure. Samples were collected in deionised water amended with peptone and antifoam agent. Ambient weather conditions were also monitored every 10 min following initiation of sampling. Concurrently with downwind samples, background (ambient) air samples were collected to compensate for any ambient airborne microorganisms. In addition, biosolids samples were collected for analysis of target indicator and pathogenic organisms. Soil samples were also collected and analysed. Significant numbers of heterotrophic plate count (HPC) bacteria were found in air samples collected during the biosolid application process. These could have arisen from soil particles being aerosolised during the land application process. Aerosolised soil may contribute significantly to the amount of aerosolised microorganisms. Soil particles may be able to more readily aerosolise, due to their low density, small particle size and low mass. Aerosolised HPC bacteria found during biosolids land application were similar to those found during normal tractor operation on non-biosolids applied fields. Coliforms and coliphages were not routinely detected even though they were found to be present in the biosolids at relatively high concentrations, 10(6) and 10(4)/g (dry weight) of biosolids respectively. This could be due to the die-off rate of aerosolised Gram-negative bacteria or sorption to the solid portion of the biosolids. Low numbers of aerosolised coliphages may likewise be due to sorption phenomena. We theorise that only organisms in the aqueous phase of the biosolids were available to desorb and be aerosolised. Animal viruses, which were not detected in the biosolids, were likewise not detected in the aerosol samples. Clostridium perfringens was detected in only a small percent of aerosol samples although it was detected during all weather conditions; other microorganisms were detected during more favourable environmental conditions (relative humidity >10%). Despite the fact that many of these organisms were present in the biosolids at significant concentrations, their presence in bioaerosols generated during the land application of biosolids was limited to only a small percentage of samples. Bacteria as well as viruses may sorb to biosolids, which contain a high percentage of organic matter, and desorption during land application of biosolids may not readily take place; therefore, these microorganisms may not be readily aerosolised.

AB  - The considerable impact of disease outbreaks on commercial shrimp farming during the last two decades has significantly affected the operational management of shrimp farms worldwide. Crop losses forced shrimp producers to look for more sustainable culture practices and facility designs to minimize the risk associated with exposure to viral pathogens. Shrimp culture under limited discharge can increase biosecurity and minimize losses to disease outbreaks while reducing negative environmental impact. A 71-day nursery study was conducted in greenhouse-enclosed raceways to evaluate the effect of two water exchange regimes and the use of foam fractionators on selected water quality indicators, growth, survival, and health of Litopenaeus vannamei postlarvae (PL). Four 40 m(3) raceways were stocked with 4-5-day-old PL at a density of 4050 PL m(-3). All raceways were equipped with high pressure rapid sand filter, a pump, a center longitudinal partition over a 5.1 cm PVC pipe with nozzles, eighteen 5.1 cm airlift pumps, six 1m long air diffusers and a 5.1 cm Venturi injector. Two out of the four raceways were each equipped with a home-made foam fractionator (FF). Average water usage in the two raceways operated with FF was 3.35% d(-1) compared to the 9.37% d(-1) used in the other two. Shrimp in the raceways operated with FF and the lower water exchange had greater mean final weight (1.91 and 2.0 a vs. 1.73 and 1.43 g), survival (100 and 92.4% vs. 55.9 and 81.8%), yield (7.64 and 6.89 kg m(-3) vs. 3.92 and 4.74 kg m(-3)) and FCR (0.97 and 1.06 vs. 1.36 and 1.64) values than those operated without FF and with higher water exchange rate. Disease diagnostic results showed no signs of viral pathogen infection. Histological observations of samples collected at the study termination suggest that the shrimp raised in the higher water exchange raceways had greater external fouling and higher intestinal bacterial load than those maintained at lower water exchange. Nitrite-nitrogen was significantly lower in the reduced water exchange than the higher exchange raceways, whereas reactive phosphorus, turbidity, and algal density were significantly higher. No other differences in water quality were found between treatments. This study demonstrated the feasibility of producing healthy juveniles of the Pacific white shrimp under limited discharge conditions in tanks operated with foam fractionators with good growth, survival, yield and FCR results.

AB  - Atmospheric dispersion models are widely used to predict the potential for annoyance of odour emissions. It is well established that the predictive accuracy of these models is higher for the mean concentration. In reality, the concentration of a substance advected by a turbulent boundary layer flow often shows large fluctuations around its mean value. In the case of odorous gases, the mean concentration field only may thus hide information on the real impact on receptors, since such a process exhibits nonlinearity. Short-term odour concentrations have to be accounted for, thereby requiring additional knowledge on concentration fluctuations. Here, the main goal is to evaluate three selected approaches to predict sub-hourly odour peak concentrations. These approaches are the constant factor of 4, an empirical-based peak-to-mean procedure and the concentration-variance computation. A full-scale field dispersion experiment (Uttenweiler), for which concentration fluctuation measurements have been conducted, was designated for the investigation. In this respect, additional objectives of this work are to investigate the mean flow conditions encountered in the different dispersion trials, to examine the measured tracer fast-response concentration time series, and to characterise the performance of a Lagrangian particle dispersion model (LASAT) for the mean concentration. Several statistical indicators are used to compare predictions against observations. First, there is evidence, gained from evaluating the ultrasonic anemometer data, to show that not only neutral but also stable atmospheric conditions occurred during the trials. Second, the dispersion model showed an overall satisfactory performance under the given range of study conditions. A general bias towards underestimation was detected, with the dispersion model performing better for distances further away from the emission source. Third, for the concentration fluctuations, results are presented and discussed in terms of the fluctuation intensity, intermittency, peak-to-mean factors and probability density functions. Finally, regarding the three evaluated approaches, it is found that as the inherent complexity of the approaches grows, more accurate predictions of peak-to-mean factors Psi(90) are obtained. Namely, the concentration-variance computation approach performed best, with bias towards overestimating Psi(90). While the constant factor of 4 overestimated all Psi(90) observations, the empirical-based peak-to-mean procedure underestimated Psi(90) to a great extent. The results also confirm and reveal the advantages and shortcomings of each evaluated approach. The findings of this work have potential implications for future research and policymaking in this topic area.

AB  - Fish batches are often transported from aquacultures to laboratory facilities, and this fact triggers a pre-stressed condition that can cause alterations in both physiological and behavioural status of animals. The acclimation before fish trials is highly recommended to ideally ensure basal levels for the species, but there is still limited information concerning the period of time and parameters to be included for the evaluation. Facing those facts, brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) juveniles subjected to an acute transport (around 2 h) were here tested during 42 days post-stress (at 12 h, 7, 14, 28 and 42 days), in order to: 1) define a multi-parameter approach, based on biochemical, physical, morphological, nutritional and behavioural parameters that best characterize the fish acclimation and welfare status; and (2) propose an adequate acclimation period for brown trout juveniles after transportation to new housing conditions.
   Behavioural changes were noted with an overall stabilization at the 17th day. Fish tended to occupy preferentially the bottom of the tank, a smaller number of tank sections, decreased the swimming activity and the number of abnormal movements. Reaction time to food decreased until it was instantaneous, and the reaction to food gradually changed over time, so that on the 1st day there was no reaction and, from the 30th day, most of the fish moved continuously to reach the food. Feed intake did not occur on the 1st day, and then increased gradually. Despite that, there were no differences in fish condition and hepatosomatic indices over time.
   In general, glucose was relatively stable along the assay, and cholesterol decreased at the 7th and 14th days, compared to 12 h, possibly as a consequence of the high metabolic demand induced by stress. Cortisol varied from 21,841.9 pg/mL (12 h) to 2162.2 pg/mL (42 day). As for cortisol, the volume-weighted nuclear volume of interrenal cells was not significantly distinct between sampling days, but a minimum of 96.33 mu m(3) was reached at 28 days. Higher haemoglobin values were obtained at 28th and 42th days, in relation to 12 h and the 14th day. Triglycerides, potassium and haematocrit did not change. The quantitative skin analyses (fragments and histological sections) showed a reduction in the pigmented area, with stabilization at 14th day.
   Acclimation of brown trout juveniles should be monitored using a multi-parameter evaluation including behavioural, biochemical, nutritional and morphological analyses. Overall, it is recommended an acclimation period of at least 28 days.

AB  - Under semiarid Mediterranean climatic conditions, soils typically have low organic matter content and weak structure resulting in low infiltration rates. Aggregate stability is a quality indicator directly related to soil organic matter, which can be redistributed within soil by tillage. Long-term effects (1983-1996) of tillage systems on water stability of pre-wetted and air dried aggregates, soil organic carbon (SOC) stratification and crop production were studied in a Vertic Luvisol with a loam texture. Tillage treatments included conventional tillage (CT), minimum tillage (MT) and zero tillage (ZT) under winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and vetch (Vicia sativa L.) rotation (W-V), and under continuous monoculture of winter wheat or winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (CM). Aggregate stability of soil at a depth of 0-5 cm was much greater when 1-2 mm aggregates were vacuum wetted prior to sieving (83%) than when slaked (6%). However, slaking resulted in tillage effects that were consistent with changes in SOC. Aggregate stability of slaked aggregates was greater under ZT than under CT or NIT in both crop rotations (i.e., 11% vs. 3%, respectively).
   SOC under ZT tended to accumulate in the surface soil layer (0-5 and 5-10 cm) at the expense of deeper ones. At depths of 10-20 and 20-30 cm no differences in SOC were encountered among tillage systems, but CT exhibited the highest concentration at 30-40 cm depth. Nevertheless, when comparisons were made on mass basis (Mg ha(-1)), significant differences in stocked SOC were observed at depths of 0-10 and 0-20 cm, where ZT had the highest SOC content in both rotations. The stock of SOC to a depth of 40 cm, averaged across crop rotations, was greater under ZT (43 Mg ha(-1)) than under CT (41 Mg ha(-1)) and MT (40 Mg ha-1) although these figures were not significantly different. Likewise, no significant differences were encountered in the stock of SOC to a depth of 40 cm among crop rotations (i.e., 42 Mg ha(-1) for W-V vs. 40 Mg ha(-1) for CM). Crop production with wheat-vetch and continuous cereal showed no differences among tillage systems. Yields were strongly limited by the environmental conditions, particularly the amount of rainfall received in the crop growth season and its distribution. Similar yield and improved soil properties under ZT suggests that it is a more sustainable system for the semiarid Mediterranean region of Spain. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Data on aquatic and emergent vegetation, morphology and water quality from 274 Polish lowland lakes surveyed in the years 1996-2009 were used to validate the preliminary typology of Polish lakes based on macrophytes and to indicate the environmental parameters which most significantly determine the vegetation patterns in lakes under various morphological conditions. In highly alkaline lowland lakes representing non-disturbed conditions the key determinants influencing the vegetation patterns were mean depth and the shape of the littoral. Three morphological lake types were distinguished: shallow (<3.5 m), deep, and additionally, within the latter, deep ribbon-shaped, with a clearly elongated base and steep bed slopes. The lake types varied in their vegetation patterns developed under non-disturbed conditions. In the shallow lakes, the share of the phytolittoral in the total lake area (%phytol) was the highest (40-100%, 72.3% on average) and the maximum colonisation depth (C-max) the lowest (3.2 m as the maximum) compared to the lakes from both deep types. In the ribbon-shaped deep lakes, %phytol and the plant coverage (%cover) were the lowest, the proportion of submerged vegetation was extraordinarily high (over 90%) and the emergent vegetation was extremely sparsely developed (<6%) compared to the lakes of the two other types.
   The alterations of aquatic vegetation resulting from the eutrophication process in distinguished morphological lake types were explored. Within the macrophyte variables tested, three groups of indicators were distinguished: (a) metrics performing best in selected lake types, i.e. the type-specific indicators (abundance metrics, %Pota), (b) metrics performing equally well in all the lake types, considered as the universal indicators (e.g. S_Chara, %Subm and %Emerg) and (c) metrics performing poorly in all the lake types, with generally limited applicability (most of the metrics on syntaxonomic richness). In the shallow lakes, %cover and %phytol performed notably better than in deep lakes, whereas Cmax worked best in deep lakes and showed the strongest response in the deep regular-shaped lakes. Moreover, in deep regular-shaped lakes the number of communities of stoneworts and submerged plants (S_Chara and S_Subm), and in deep ribbon-shaped lakes the proportion of area inhabited by vascular plant communities (%Pota) performed exceptionally better than in the other two lake types. The most universal metrics, performing equally well in all the lake types, were the proportions of submerged (%Subm) and emergent (%Emerg) vegetation in the total phytolittoral area.

AB  - Size-resolved trace metal concentrations of 15 elements in aerosol particles at the Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory (CVAO) under remote background conditions were investigated through analysis of aerosol samples collected during intensive field studies from January 2007 to November 2011 using total reflection x-ray fluorescence (TXRF). The identification of the main air mass origin that influence remote marine aerosol in the northern tropical Atlantic has been investigated. In total, 317 samples were collected. The dataset was analyzed according to the main air mass inflow at the station. We found that remote conditions make up about 45% of the meteorological conditions in a year at CVAO and thus the northern tropical Atlantic. Surprisingly, air masses from North America are often responsible for higher trace metal concentrations in this region.
   Elements such as Zn, Pb, Cu, Cr, Ni, and V were mostly found in the submicron size fractions, while elements with dominant crustal or oceanic origin such as Fe, Ti, Mn, Sr, and Rb were found in the coarse fractions (> 1 mu m). The highest metal concentrations, especially for Zn (3.23 ng m(-3)), Cu (0.81 ng m(-3)), Sr (2.63 ng m(-3)), and Cr (0.53 ng m(-3)), were observed in air masses originating from North America and the concentrations were within the same concentration range to those reported previously in the literature for remote marine aerosols. Fe (12.26 ng m(-3)), Ti (0.91 ng m(-3)), and Mn (0.35 ng m(-3)) showed higher concentrations when air mass came from Europe and the Canary Islands. Pb concentration was low (< 0.20 ng m(-3)) and did not vary significantly with air mass direction. The low Pb concentration is indicative of the complete phase-out of leaded gasoline even in African countries. Crustal enrichment factor values decreased from fine to coarse-mode particles with low values (< 4) observed for Fe, Mn, and Rb, and high values (> 20) for Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, Pb, and Se. The observed enrichment of the elements was attributed to crustal, marine, anthropogenic, and biogenic sources, as well as long-range transport and resuspension. Zn, Cu and Pb were indicators of anthropogenic activities, while Ti and Sr were indicators of crustal and marine origin, respectively. Oceanic and biogenic emissions might have contributed to most of the Se observed. This work provides the first long-term size-resolved trace metals study for remote tropical northern Atlantic marine aerosols and the dataset could serve as good initiation of yearly flux estimates.

AB  - BackgroundAlthough the apple snail Pila globosa is used as indicator species for human consumption locally and as fish feed, research on it in general is very scanty. It is used in food industry, in aquaculture as fish bait and used as food in many regions of India and many other countries, but research on it has been started in the 1970s. Only 40 articles are available on this organism in PubMed indicating an urgent need of basic research on it especially work on its spatiotemporal morphometry Therefore, sampling of P. globosa was done from different parts of India in different seasons (summer, winter and rainy), and different morphometric studies were performed on this organism to draw baseline information. Analysis was conducted to study morphometry, the relationship between shell length and the weight and relative condition factor of Indian apple snail Pila globosa collected from five zones (east, west, north, south and centre) of India during 2018-2019 year.ResultsThe shell length (SL) (46.5 13.33), shell width (SW) (40.22 +/- 11.5 mm), spire length (SPL) (2.99 +/- 0.15 mm), base length (BL) (12.53 +/- 2.94 mm), aperture length (AL) (21.95 +/- 4.36 mm), aperture width (AW) (2.74 +/- 0.47 mm) and shell weight (WT) (31.08 +/- 13.76 g) were observed to be varied among the individual sampled across India. Different relationships for SL/SW (Log SW=0.9889 Log SL + 0.9444), SL/SPL (Log SPL = 0.1452 Log SL+0.3815), SL/BL (Log BL=0.7789 Log SL+0.5814), SL/AL (Log AL= 0.6518 Log SL+0.9111) and SL/AW (Log AW=0.4475 Log SL+0.1422) were observed by considering shell length as basic index. The relationship between shell length and shell weight was found to be Log WT=2.0263 Log SL+0.1098. The relative condition factor revealed uninterrupted and good environmental condition observed for apple snails. A negative allometric growth pattern was observed from the length-weight relationship.Conclusion The environments of apple snail in India are not contaminated, and the results can be used as baseline data in aquaculture for model analysis and can be used as a reference for drawing relationship among different morphometric indices of P. globosa in India, as there is no such information available on it. The data can also be used for mass scale production of P. globosa for consumption by human and use in aquatic industries as fish feed.

AB  - The La Cocha ultramafic body, in the Sierra Chica of Cordoba (Sierras Pampeanas, Argentina), is formed by serpentinized spinel harzburgites, with lenses of spinel pyroxenites and hornblendites. The associated metamorphic rocks are garnet sillimanite gneisses, intercalated with tabular bodies of pyroxene amphibolites and forsterite marbles.
   Mineral chemistry of relict primary phases (olivine, orthopyroxene and spinel) from samples of the spinel harzburgites and pyroxenites was determined, and several geothermometers were applied to estimate the temperature conditions under which these rocks may have been equilibrated.
   In the spinel harzburgites, the primary spinel is Al-chromite [Cr# = Cr/(Cr + Al) = 0.48-0.57], which is replaced by ferrichromite and chlinoclore by metamorphism. Orthopyroxene is enstatite (En(92)) and olivine is classified as forsterite (Fo(92)); this last one shows a homogeneous and constant composition along the ultramafic body. Using geothermometric calibrations of the pair olivine-spinel, the highest temperature of 1157 degrees C would correspond to the primary conditions of formation of the harzburgites.
   The spinel pyroxenites show a mineral composition defined by orthopyroxene (En(85), enstatite), olivine (Fo(86), chrysolite), spinel (s. s.) and magnetite. Serpentine and clinochlore were produced by metamorphism. Spinel has high concentrations in Al and very low in Cr, and is classified as spinel sensu stricto; magnetite replacement was produced by metamorphism. Orthopyroxene and olivine are depleted in MgO regarding these minerals in the harzburgites. Temperatures of 785-734 degrees C calculated using geothermometers with orthopyroxene are interpreted to be produced by metamorphism in amphibolite to granulite facies conditions.
   Cumular textures were not observed in outcrops and thin sections of the studied rocks. The narrow composicional range and high forsterite content in olivine, the high Cr# in spinel, and the low concentrations of Ni and Cr in whole rock analyses indicate a mantle residual origin for these peridotites, which would exclude a cumular origin.
   The association of peridotites with mafic bodies formed in an N-type MORB environment and a relict mantle fabric showed by the elongated crystals/aggregates of olivine (preserved in pseudomorphic replacements), indicating a high temperature flow, allow to interpret the La Cocha ultramafic body as a slice of oceanic mantle, belonging to basal tectonites of an ophiolite complex. This body shows similar petrological, geochemical and structural features than the other ultramafic bodies in the Sierras de Cordoba, therefore the origin proposed here could be applied to the other bodies.

AB  - In the Southern part of Hanoi, high ammonium (NH4+) concentrations in reducing groundwater have been an issue over the last 25 years. Elevated NH4+ concentrations in groundwater, in general, are an indicator of influences from anthropogenic sources, but the buried peat layers in the Red River delta formation are also hypothesized to contribute to the high NH4+ levels (up to 100 mg/l). We traced the sources of NH4+ at the Nam Du well field of the Hanoi water works by means of isotope ratios (N-15/N-14). The delta N-15 values were determined for total sedimentary N and exchangeable NH4+ of the peat material, and for NH4+ dissolved in deep and shallow groundwater, sewage, and surface water. Groundwater NH4+ of the upper (Holocene) and the lower (Pleistocene) aquifers had higher delta N-15 values than did total N and NH4+ of the sediments, and were somewhat higher than the delta N-15 values of NH4+ in sewage and surface water. We conclude that the present conditions of temperature and pH tend to promote deprotonation of NH4+ to ammonia (NH3), which eventually degasses from the groundwater table to the unsaturated pore space. This can cause an enrichment of N-15 in the remaining NH4+, as the lighter N-14 in NH3 is volatilized at a slightly faster rate. The intermediate delta N-15 values within the Pleistocene aquifer can be explained by the recharge thereto, which is a mixture of the high delta N-15 values of the Holocene aquifer and the low delta N-15 values of water infiltrating from the Red River into the Pleistocene aquifer. Some part of the increased groundwater NH4+ is likely to arise from anthropogenic activities, as supported by several indications: a large drawdown in the Pleistocene aquifer caused by Hanoi's extensive water abstraction and subsequent downward gradient from the upper Holocene aquifer; the presence of coliforms in groundwater; and a positive correlation between ammonium and DOC, Cl, Br and Ni, but a lack of correlation with As. However, the much higher concentrations of NH4+ in the groundwater compared to the potential surface sources, the positive correlation between NH4+ and DOC, the abundance of natural organic matter (OM), the amount of exchangeable NH4+ in the sediments, and the highly reducing conditions in the aquifers indicate that N-mineralization of organic N from the peat contribute substantially to the high NH4+ levels in groundwater of the Nam Du well field.

AB  - Purpose - The measurement and comparison across countries of female conditions in labour market and gender gap in employment is a very complex task, given both its multidimensional nature and the different scenarios in terms of economic, social and cultural characteristics. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - At this aim, different information about presence and engagement of women in labour market, gender pay gap, segregation, discrimination and human capital characteristics was combined and a ranking of 26 European countries is proposed through the composite indicator methodology. It satisfies the need to benchmark national gender gaps, grouping together economic, political and educational dimensions.
   Findings - The results show that female conditions in labour market are the best in Scandinavian countries and Ireland while many Eastern and Southern European countries result at the bottom of classification. Research limitations/implications - In order to take into account the subjectivity of some choices in composite indicator construction and to test robustness of results, different aggregation techniques were applied.
   Practical implications - The authors hope that this new index will stimulate the release of a sort of best practices useful to close labour market gaps, starting from best countries' scenarios, and the launching of pilot gender parity task forces, as it happened with the Global Gender Gap Index in some countries. Finally, relating gender gap indexes with country policies frameworks for gender inequalities and the connected policy outcomes, it is possible to evaluate their effectiveness and to identify the most adequate initiatives to undertake because policies reducing gender gaps can significantly improve economic growth and standard of living.
   Social implications - The analysis gives a contribution in the evaluation of the policies and regulations effectiveness at national level considering the existing welfare regimes and the associated gaps in labour market. It can help policy makers to understand the ramifications of gaps between women and men. The Gender Gap Labour Market Index is constrained by the need for international comparability, but limiting its analysis to European countries; it has been based on ad hoc indicators concerning developed economies and could be readily adapted for use at the national and local levels.
   Originality/value - In this paper the authors propose a new composite indicator index specifically focused on gender gap in labour market. Several papers analysed gender differences in wages, employment or segregation, but few of them consider them together, allowing to get a satisfactory informative picture on gender inequalities in labour market and studying in deep its multiple aspects, including discrimination indicators ad hoc calculated, giving to policy makers an useful tool to evaluate female employees conditions and put them in relation with the different input factors existing within each country.

AB  - 1. Animals raised in good environmental conditions are expected to have more resources to invest in immunity than those raised in poor conditions. Variation in immune activity and parasite resistance in response to changes in environmental temperature, population density and food quality have been shown in many invertebrate species.
   2. Almost all studies to date have examined the effects of individual variables in isolation. The aim of this study was to address whether environmental factors interact to produce synergistic effects on phenoloxidase (PO) activity and haemocyte count, both indicators of immune system activity. Temperature, food quality and density were varied in a fully factorial design for a total of eight treatment combinations.
   3. Strong interactions between the three environmental variables led to the magnitude and in some cases the direction of the effect of most variables changing as the other environmental factors were altered. Overall, food quality had the most important and consistent influence, larvae raised on a good-quality diet having substantially higher PO activity in every case and substantially higher haemocyte counts in all treatments except unheated/low density.
   4. When food quality was good, the larvae showed 'density-dependent prophylaxis': raising their investment in immunity when population density is high. When food quality was poor and the temperature low, however, those larvae raised at high densities invested less in immunity.
   5. Increased temperature is often thought to lead to increased immune reactivity in ectotherms, but we found that the effect of temperature was strongly dependent on the values of other environmental variables. PO activity increased with temperature when larvae were raised on good food or when density was high, but when food was poor and density low, a higher temperature led to reduced PO activity. A higher temperature led to higher haemocyte counts when density was high and food quality was poor, but in all other cases, the effect of increased temperature was either close to zero or somewhat negative.
   6. Although PO activity and haemocyte count were weakly correlated across the whole data set, there were a number of treatments where the two measures responded in different ways to environmental change. Overall, effect sizes for PO activity were substantially higher than those for haemocyte count, indicating that the different components of the immune system vary in their sensitivity to environmental change.
   7. Predictions of the effect of environmental or population change on immunity and disease dynamics based on laboratory experiments that only investigate the effects of single variable are likely to be inaccurate or even entirely wrong.

KW  - COMBUSTION
AB  - This paper highlights some of the major findings of the Alkali Deposits Investigation, a collaborative effort to understand the causes of unmanageable ash deposits in biomass-fired electric power boilers. A group of interested industrial institutions and the US DOE Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Office's Biomass Power Program through the National Renewable Energy Laboratory jointly sponsored the project. The industries contributed both funding and, in most cases, use of facilities to the project and included Mendota Biomass Power and Woodland Biomass Power (both associated with Thermo Electron Energy Systems), CMS Generation Operating (formerly Hydra-Co Operations), Wheelabrator, Shasta and Hudson Energy, Sithe Energy, Delano Energy, the Electric Power Research Institute, Foster Wheeler Development, and Elkraft Power of Denmark. Research contracts with Thomas R. Miles Consulting Design Engineers, Sandia National Laboratories, and The National Renewable Energy Laboratories provided the government portion of the funding. In addition, the University of California at Davis and the Bureau of Mines performed significant work in close collaboration with the other researchers. This summary highlights the major findings of the project more thoroughly discussed in a recent report [2]. We highlight fuel properties, bench-scale combustion tests, a framework for considering ash deposition processes, pilot-scale tests of biomass fuels, and field tests in commercially operating biomass power generation stations. Detailed chemical analyses of 11 biomass fuels representing a broad cross-section of commercially available fuels reveal their properties that relate to ash deposition tendencies. The fuels fall into three broad categories:
   (1) straws and grasses (herbaceous materials); (2) pits, shells, hulls and other agricultural by-products of a generally ligneous nature; and (3) woods and recycle fuels of commercial interest. Woods and wood-derived products represent the most commonly used biomass fuels. Herbaceous fuels contain silicon and potassium as their principal ash-forming constituents. They are also commonly high in chlorine relative to other biomass fuels. These properties portend potentially severe ash deposition problems at high or moderate combustion temperatures. The primary sources of these problems are shown to be: (1) the reaction of alkali with silica to form alkali silicates that melt or soften at low temperatures (can be lower than 700 degrees C, depending on composition), and (2) the reaction of alkali with sulfur to form alkali sulfates on combustor heat transfer surfaces. Alkali material plays a central role in both processes. The mobility of alkali material, defined as its ability to come in physical contact with other materials, is measured using chemical extractive techniques. Potassium is the dominant source of alkali in most biomass fuels. The analyses below indicate that essentially, all of the biologically occurring alkali, in particular potassium, has high mobility. The non-biologically occurring alkali is present as soil contaminants and additives to the fuels, such as clay fillers used in paper production. This non-biologically occurring alkali exhibits far lower mobility than the biological fraction. The relative amounts of biologically vs, non-biologically occurring material depend on fuel type and fuel handling. In the fuels investigated here, the dominant form of alkali was biologically occurring potassium. Some traditional indicators of deposit behavior, most notably ash fusion temperatures, poorly predict ash behavior compared with a more mechanistic interpretation of the data. Many of the agricultural by-products also contain high potassium concentrations with equally high potassium mobility.
   Some woods, on the other hand, contain far less ash overall, differing by as much as a factor of 40 from high-ash straws, for example. In addition, the ash-forming constituents contain greater amounts of calcium with less silicon. The total amount of potassium in wood is much lower than in straws, although this is not necessarily the case when expressed as a fraction of total ash. Calcium reacts with sulfur to form sulfates in ways analogous to potassium, but the lower mobility and vapor pressure of calcium and the structural properties of the deposits it forms are both more favorable to sustained furnace operation than the ashes formed from straws and grasses. Chlorine is shown to be a major factor in deposit formation.
   Chlorine facilitates the mobility of many inorganic compounds, in particular potassium. Potassium chloride is among the most stable high-temperature, gas-phase, alkali-containing species. Chlorine concentration often dictates the amount of alkali vaporized during combustion more strongly than the alkali concentration in the fuel. In most cases, the chlorine appears to play a shuttle role, facilitating the transport of alkali from the fuel to surfaces, where the alkali often forms sulfates. In the absence of sulfur, chlorides often reside on the surface. In the absence of chlorine, alkali hydroxides are the major stable gas-phase species in moist, oxidizing environments (combustion gases). Bench-scale combustion tests coupled with mass spectrometry techniques reveal the major species evolving from biomass samples during combustion. The fuels subjected to these combustion tests were also examined by chemical analyses.
   The tests indicate that the major release of alkali material occurs during the char combustion phase and that the primary form of stable alkali-bearing off-gases corresponds with thermodynamic estimates of product stability and vapor pressure. Investigations were performed varying temperature, oxygen concentration, and moisture levels and revealed thermodynamically consistent results; the amount of alkali vaporized increases with temperature and the amount of hydroxide formed increases with increasing moisture content. Details of other species released are also presented. Thermogravimetric and differential thermogravimetric analyses of the samples were also performed, the results of which prove to be marginally useful to predicting ash deposition.
   A conceptual framework expresses ash deposition as a combination of four mechanisms: inertial impaction, thermophoretic deposition, condensation, and chemical reaction is presented. This conceptual framework serves to organize the remaining discussion and observations of ash deposition at both pilot and commercial scale. The influences of boiler design, boiler operating conditions, and fuel properties on ash deposit behavior reveal themselves by emphasizing or reducing the role of one or more of these mechanisms and thereby changing deposit composition, phase, and properties. Pilot-scale investigations on the standard suite of fuels were carried out in an entrained-flow furnace.
   Isokinetically sampled fly ash samples and deposits collected on instrumented, temperature-regulated probes simulating both water-walls and convection pass provide the basis for in situ and subsequent ex situ examination of deposits. Deposit properties reveal spatial dependencies on probe surfaces that are consistent with both the commercial-scale tests and the conceptual framework for deposit growth and property development. In addition, changes in deposit composition with time, temperature, and other operation-relevant variables exhibit the same consistencies with commercial operation and the conceptual framework.
   Fuels containing high alkali and silica concentrations form alkali silicates that melt or sinter at low temperatures. The rates of deposit growth and sintering/melting increase with increasing temperature and chlorine concentration but are high at all boiler-relevant temperatures and chlorine concentrations for the straws and grasses. Surfaces exposed to impacting particles can accumulate silica and alkali silicates at very rapid rates. Surfaces exposed to combustion gases but less exposed to particle impaction show evidence of thermophoretic accumulation of deposits, vapor condensation, and sulfation of condensed alkali-laden vapors. These processes lead to deposits with markedly different properties (high reflectivity, modest thickness and growth rate) compared to the impacted regions.
   Fuels containing little alkali or silica indicate far less deposit growth and development of more manageable deposits, by which we mean soot blowers and boiler maintenance techniques are able to sustain operation of a facility for periods of many months without unscheduled shutdowns. Commercial-scale investigations using nearly every type of commercially significant biomass boiler design provide full scale data for analysis and comparison with pilot-scale results. Bubbling fluid beds, circulating fluid beds, and various grate-based combustors fed by stokers, augers, and a cigar burner provided the data for comparison. Fuel types ranged from wood-derived material with blended agricultural by-products to straws, sometimes blended with urban wood fuel. Many of the commercial-scale experiments were conducted in the context of commercial operation and employed varying compositions in the fuel.
   In all cases, comparisons of deposit composition with position in the boiler, type of deposit surface, position on the surface, and fuel properties reveal complete consistency with the fuel analyses, bench-scale combustion results, pilot-scale results, and the conceptual framework. Fuels containing high alkali and silica fractions exhibited the same rapid accumulation of ash deposits with the same sintered/molten character as was observed in the pilot-scale tests. Advanced mineralogical examinations of selected deposits indicate chemical compositions consistent with the conceptual framework and are presented as appendix material. The deposit properties are consistent with the conceptual framework for their formation and the observed bench-scale combustion results. Fuels with less alkali, chlorine, and silica, with less total ash-forming material, and with higher calcium contents exhibit more manageable ash deposits. Wood and non-recyclable paper generated the most manageable deposits.
   This report provides highlights of a more detailed analysis of fuel property, operating condition, and boiler design issues that dictate as deposit formation and property development [1,2]. The span of investigations from bench-top experiments to commercial operation and observations, including both practical illustrations and theoretical background, provides a self-consistent and reasonably robust basis to understand the qualitative nature of ash deposit formation in biomass boilers. While there remain many quantitative details to be pursued to complete our understanding, this project encapsulates essentially all of the conceptual aspects of the issue. It provides a basis for understanding and potentially resolving the technical and environmental issues associated with ash deposition during biomass combustion. Publised by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The Greater Everglades Ecosystem is a globally important ecoregion, home to 68 threatened or endangered species and the largest designated wilderness area in the Eastern United States. Anthropogenic manipulations of the natural hydrology have led to widespread degradation of this ecosystem and monitored population declines across multiple taxa. Simultaneous introductions of hundreds of non-native species into South Florida and their subsequent invasion into the Everglades has further impacted native Everglades communities. Predictions for future climate change suggest that the Everglades is headed towards a drier future, making it crucial to understand how changes in hydrological regimes will impact both native and non-native fauna. Our study combines the results of a landscape-scale experimental manipulation conducted to assess the impact of differing hydrological regimes at the Loxahatchee Impoundment Landscape Assessment between 2018 and 2020 with a community composition analysis of data collected across multiple habitat types throughout Everglades National Park between 2000 and 2002. Both datasets used a variety of survey methods to extensively characterize the amphibian and reptile amphibian assemblage across habitat types and hydrological regimes. An NMDS analysis indicated that variation in hydrology is the primary axis structuring reptile and amphibian habitat usage across the Everglades, with non-native species more likely to be indicators of drier habitat types. This result concurred with those from the landscape-scale manipulation, in which non-native species were significantly favored by drier hydrological conditions. Taken together, these results suggest that a drier future within the Greater Everglades Ecosystem may facilitate further spread of South Florida's diverse non-native amphibian and reptile assemblage.

AB  - Biologically available phosphorus supports plant growth but can also cause environmental contamination. Sequential extraction methods, such as Hedley fractionation, are the most widely used to assess available phosphorus from solids. However, such methods exhibit numerous deficiencies. The USEPA Leaching Environmental Assessment Framework (LEAF) is a tiered system developed to evaluate releases of Potentially Toxic Elements (PTEs) from solids. This study compared the Hedley fractionation method to the LEAF pH-dependent, parallel batch tests (Method 1313) and dynamic leaching column test (Method 1314) to assess the bioavailability of phosphorus. The three methods were applied to wastewater treatment plant sludge before and after thermal treatment. Both methods revealed similar qualitative trends, namely that thermal treatment transformed phosphorus into less immediately available forms. However, the Hedley and LEAF methods were inconsistent in the forms and amounts of available phosphorus recovered from the solids. The Hedley method left 40% of phosphorus unextracted from sludge and 20% from ash, suggesting that it may be less appropriate for organic materials. Moreover, only 2 of the 6 Hedley phosphorus pools were within environmentally relevant pH conditions. Furthermore, the Hedley method overpredicted the readily available phosphorus. In contrast, the LEAF methods allowed for a more detailed analysis of phosphorus availability - while simultaneously assessing PTEs across a controlled pH range. Moreover, LEAF used simpler procedures and provided more easily interpreted results. Thus, LEAF facilitates more robust and valuable assessment of organic and inorganic solids being considered for land application. Crown Copyright (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This review of trends in inland saline lakes of Europe and Central Asia is based on the relevant section of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Regional Assessment Report for Europe and Central Asia (ECA). We assessed the present status of ECA saline lakes and the effects of direct drivers (climate change, land use, pollution, resource exploitation, invasive species) on ecosystem health and biodiversity. We also assessed past, current and future trends using habitat area and degradation, species richness, and endangered species as indicators. No uniform scenario is applicable to saline lakes in the region. The desiccation of the Aral Sea is caused mainly by land use change and water extraction. In the Caspian Sea, river modifications, water pollution, overfishing and poaching, and species invasions have led to a decrease in species richness and have threatened endemic species. Although trends for smaller saline lakes vary, our analysis demonstrates that land use change, over-exploitation, and pollution are more important direct drivers of ecosystem health and biodiversity than climate change. The establishment of baseline biodiversity values for saline lakes is, however, complicated because biodiversity and the food-web structure are variable and depend strongly on salinity. Thus, there is a need to classify the ecological quality, biodiversity and ecosystem services of saline lakes along a salinity gradient. The improvement of water management and reuse of water, conservation measures, and introduction of climate-smart agriculture are basic conditions for the sustainable use of saline lakes in the region.

AB  - The thermal characteristics of an area are influenced by the surrounding physical environment including land cover, land use, and urban geometry. The environment of wetland settlements is primarily influenced by the presence of water bodies. This study utilised land cover and urban geometry to characterise the thermal behaviour of the Ogan Permata Indah Jakabaring Palembang wetland settlement area. Data collected hourly during 72 h of field measurements included air temperature, relative humidity, globe temperature, and wind velocity. The cloud cover was qualitatively recorded. The land cover, urban geometry, and solar and wind orientations of the settlement were also investigated. Results showed that compared to the natural environment, the increase of air temperature during the day in built-up areas is about 2.5-7.4 degrees C which depends on the weather condition. Besides that, the openness of the area facilitated airflow, while roughness increased airflow turbulence, rendering more effective cooling. The role of the water body in delaying heat re-emission into the environment was more effective if the building geometry did not inhibit airflow. In this case, the role of the water body is to increase the surrounding air temperature by 1.2-1.6 degrees C at night, as stabilization of daily temperature. This study demonstrates that wetland settlement development policies should consider their unique thermal environment. Settlement development policies should be guided by form aspects, considering the role of the wind cooling effect, and by material aspects, considering the role of water thermal mass for delaying the re-emission of heat energy.

AB  - Temporal dynamics in ecological variables are usually assessed using linear trends or smoothing methods. Those trends qualitatively summarise the increase or decrease in the variable of interest over a given time period. Yet, linear trends do not capture changes in the direction or in the rate of change of indices such as population trajectories, that may typically occur when conditions improve or worsen following conservation actions or environmental disturbances. In a similar way, non-linear methods while aiming to fully characterise population trajectories, fail to end up with a standard classification. Here, we propose and test a simple method to classify the trajectory of a given ecological variable according to its trend and acceleration. Our method is based on fitting a second order polynomial that is used to describe a trajectory according to its direction, velocity, and curvature (accelerated or decelerated). We apply this method to the temporal dynamics of bird populations monitored by the French Breeding Bird Survey as a case study. Using data for more than 100 species monitored from 1989 to 2017 in more than 2000 sites, we show that one quarter of the studied species have dynamics that can be better described by our polynomial approach than typically-used linear analysis. We also show how it can be used to analyse indicators constructed with mull-species indices. Our method can be applied to any type of ecological variable either to classify trajectories of ecological variables in time or trajectories of ecological variables across pressure gradients. Overall, our results suggest a more systematic investigation of non-linear trajectories when analysing the dynamics of ecological variables.

AB  - Under the conditions of the growing season, the monitoring of gray forest soil was carried out, which was polluted with Devonian oil at a concentration of 5% and 10% by weight of the soil. The content of oil products, the amount of hydrocarbon-oxidizing microorganisms, and phytotoxicity were determined. For remediation, a natural consortium of microorganisms-destructors (CMD) was used, consisting of three strains (Achromobacter insolitus A-102 (RCAM02108), A. xylosoxidans A-10 (RCAM02109) and Pseudomonas stutzeri P-1026 (RCAM02107) with titer (2.3-2.5)center dot 10(12) CFU/cm(3), as well as bentonite in the native (6 and 12 ton/ha) and nanoscale (0.6 and 1.2 ton/ha) forms as a sorbent. When comparing the indicators of hydrocarbon content in the dynamics, it was found that a high percentage of their utilization was noted for 45 days when used separately CMD and bentonite. The use of nanobentonite, as well as the integrated application of CMD with sorbents in native and nanoscale forms, accelerate this process by 15 days. The trend observed at 5% oil pollution is maintained with an increase in pollution to 10%. Ecological and toxicological analysis of oil-contaminated soil on the morphometric parameters of the test plant (Zea mays) allowed us to build a series of effectiveness of the introduced components: CMD > CMD + nanobentonite > CMD + bentonite. Bentonite and nanobentonite, sorbing hydrocarbons, are a source of mineral nutrition for autochthonous microflora. Nanobentonite at a dose less than 10 times contributes to an increase in the efficiency of cleaning contaminated soil compared to bentonite. The combined use of CMD and sorbent in native and nanoscale forms allows us to ensure the rate of destruction of oil pollution at a higher level compared to using each component separately.

AB  - Urban sprawl in urbanizing China has resulted in a series of ecological and environmental problems. Urban planners have been committed to promoting compact development through high-density and mixed land use. However, a problem brought by such compact urban form is the mismatch between physical spaces and socio-economic activities. To date, minimal research has been conducted using spatial statistics to study this issue at the local scales. Moreover, urban night-time vitality has been consistently ignored in existing studies. In the current work, urban land use intensity was analyzed on the basis of street block density and typology, and urban daytime and night-time vitality were measured using small catering business and night-time light data, respectively. The spatial relationships between urban land use intensity and urban vitality were investigated using a local indicator of spatial association (LISA), and five megacities in China were taken as a case study to examine whether variations exist between different cities. Results showed a significant positive spatial autocorrelation between urban land use intensity and urban vitality according to global statistics. Therefore, socio-economic activities are more likely to be abundant in densely developed urban areas. However, local spatial mismatches were found in the five megacities, indicating overcrowded or underutilized urban spaces in all the cities. These relationships were associated with different urban areas (urbanized before 1995 and during 1995-2015), land use conditions (function and mixture) and time periods (day and night). The results of this work will provide a comprehensive understanding of compact city and sustainability.

AB  - Honey bee production could be considered as a reliable economic indicator of the biodiversity and availability of ecosystem services. The scaling behaviour of honey bee was analysed and associated to the natural ecosystem characteristics by using multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA). Records of honey harvests and climatic conditions were collected monthly from 1998 to 2012 of 83 apiaries (Database =14,940 records) located in 24 different micro-regions (in central-north Mexico) where 'mesquite' (Prosopis laevigata) and plants of Asteraceae family are the primarily endemic sources of nectar and pollen. Micro-regions were classified as semi-warm semi-arid, semi-arid, or humid subtropical (Koppen Climate classification; KC), and according to the agricultural uses of their surrounding areas as secondary vegetation (S), irrigated agriculture (IA) or rainfed agriculture (RA). Hurst exponents of segments (Hq) of honey bee production time series showed small fluctuations but random walk characteristic of multifractal (MF) structure. Left truncation and parameter values of honey bee harvests fractal spectra suggest local fluctuations of large magnitude with self-affine properties which represent long-term correlations useful for long-term predictions. Major variations of honey bee production in semi-arid climates have been produced by S, but it is also affected for the minimum temperature (T) and precipitation (P). MF-DFA allowed to identify fluctuations in honey bee production lime series, associating it with climatic and land use variables, useful to make reliable long-term predictions of pollinators' diversity and honey bee harvests, and to design strategies to maintain ecosystems and increase the economic feasibility of apiculture.

AB  - The ongoing rise in temperatures caused by global climate change is a critical climatic risk factor for rice production, and enhancing rice heat tolerance is an area of particular research interest. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population was developed from heat sensitive, rice cultivar IAPAR-9 crossed with heat tolerant, Liaoyan241. RIL and parental lines were exposed to high temperature at the heating and flowering stage in experiments in 2014 and 2015. As indicators of heat tolerance, the seed setting rate under natural (NS) and heat stress (HTS) conditions were measured, and the reduction rate of seed set (RRS) was calculated. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis revealed eleven heat tolerance QTLs located on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Single QTL contribution rates were 4.75-13.81% and effect values were -5.98 to 5.00. Four major QTLs (qNS1, qNS4, qNS6, and qRRS1) were stable detected in different environments in both years. Thirteen QTLs with epistatic interactions and nine QTLs with environmental interactions were also detected. Major QTLs were all involved in epistatic and environmental interactions. Three QTLs from the SSR marker interval RM471 to RM177 region of chromosome 4 (qNS4, qHTS4, and qRRS4) were all involved in epistatic and environmental interactions and contributed to phenotypic variation, indicating that this region constituted a major QTL hotspot. The major QTL for heat tolerance identified in this study will aid in breeding tolerant cultivars and facilitating investigation of the molecular underpinnings of heat tolerance in rice.

AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Changing climates are expected to affect the abundance and distribution of global vegetation, especially plants and lichens with an epiphytic lifestyle and direct exposure to atmospheric variation. The study of epiphytes could improve understanding of biological responses to climatic changes, but only if the conditions that elicit physiological performance changes are clearly defined.
   METHODS: We evaluated individual growth performance of the epiphytic lichen Evernia mesomorpha, an iconic boreal forest indicator species, in the first year of a decade-long experiment featuring whole-ecosystem warming and drying. Field experimental enclosures were located near the southern edge of the species' range.
   KEY RESULTS: Mean annual biomass growth of Evernia significantly declined 6 percentage points for every + 1 degrees C of experimental warming after accounting for interactions with atmospheric drying. Mean annual biomass growth was 14% in ambient treatments, 2% in unheated control treatments, and -9% to -19% (decreases) in energy-added treatments ranging from +2.25 to +9.00 degrees C above ambient temperatures. Warming-induced biomass losses among persistent individuals were suggestive evidence of an extinction debt that could precede further local mortality events.
   CONCLUSIONS: Changing patterns of warming and drying would decrease or reverse Evernia growth at its southern range margins, with potential consequences for the maintenance of local and regional populations. Negative carbon balances among persisting individuals could physiologically commit these epiphytes to local extinction. Our findings illuminate the processes underlying local extinctions of epiphytes and suggest broader consequences for range shrinkage if dispersal and recruitment rates cannot keep pace.

AB  - Iron (Fe) is an essential nutrient for plants but under high concentrations, such as that found naturally in clay and waterlogged soils, its toxic effect can limit production. This study aimed to investigate the stress tolerance responses exhibited by different rice cultivars. Both lowland and upland cultivars were grown under excess Fe and hypoxic conditions. Lowland cultivars showed higher Fe accumulation in roots compared with upland cultivars suggesting the use of different strategies to tolerate excess Fe. The upland Canastra cultivar displayed a mechanism to limit iron translocation from roots to the shoots, minimizing leaf oxidative stress induced by excess Fe. Conversely, the cultivar Curinga invested in the increase of R1/A, as an alternative drain of electrons. However, the higher iron accumulation in the leaves, was not necessarily related to high toxicity. Nutrient uptake and/or utilization mechanisms in rice plants are in accordance with their needs, which may be defined in relation to crop environments. Alterations in the biochemical parameters of photosynthesis suggest that photosynthesis in rice under excess Fe is primarily limited by biochemical processes rather than by diffusional limitations, particularly in the upland cultivars. The electron transport rate, carboxylation efficiency and electron excess dissipation by photorespiration demonstrate to be good indicators of iron tolerance. Altogether, these chemical and molecular patterns suggests that rice plants grown under excess Fe exhibit gene expression reprogramming in response to the Fe excess per se and in response to changes in photosynthesis and nutrient levels to maintain growth under stress.

AB  - Tidal barriers isolate intertidal areas from tides, creating distinct conditions on either side of the barrier, and freshwater releases change the receiving area's hydrology and salinity. However, the combined effect of these human actions is unknown. Using the macrobenthos community as a bioindicator, we sampled part of the northern Yellow River Delta that has been managed using tidal barriers and freshwater releases, in the spring and autumn of 2014, before and after the summer freshwater release. The macrobenthos communities differed greatly on opposite sides of the barrier. During the spring, 7 to 8 species were found inside the barrier (mainly Insecta and Crustacea), versus 22 in the intertidal area (mainly Polychaetes, Mollusca, Crustacea, and Insecta). During the autumn, 10 to 13 species were found inside the barrier and 16 in the intertidal area. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering divided the macrobenthos communities into groups that mostly agreed with the spatial distribution of the investigated areas. The characteristics of the modified ecosystems determined the similarity of the macrobenthos communities. The effects of the tidal barriers and the freshwater releases interacted: the barriers decreased sediment salinity compared with that in the intertidal area, and freshwater releases increased this differentiation. To restore the delta's original freshwater ecosystems, the tidal barriers are required to contain the freshwater releases. In addition, the effects of the freshwater releases were generally positive. Therefore, it is reasonable to retain the barriers and to continue or increase these releases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - AimsTo determine the persistence of Clostridium difficile spores in biosolids during composting or when amended into soil and held under natural environmental climatic conditions.
   Methods and ResultsFivelogCFUg(-1)Cl.difficile spores (ribotypes 027 or 078) were inoculated into agricultural soils (sandy loam or loam) amended with 10% w/w anaerobically digested biosolids. The inoculated soil:biosolids mixture was then placed into sentinel vials which were introduced at a depth of 15cm within the field plot consisting of the corresponding soil type. Two trials were performed, the first of which started in late spring (May 2013 through to August 2014) and second from November 2013 through to October 2014 (fall trial). Ribotype 078 endospores in loam or sandy loam soil decreased during the summer but then increased in numbers towards the fall. At the end of the trial, levels of ribotype 078 spores had decreased by 1.5logCFUg(,)(-1) with 027 spores decreasing by <1logCFUg(-1) over the same time period. Windrow composting of biosolids decreased Cl.difficile levels from 3.7logCFUg(-1) down to 0.3logCFUg(-1) with the greater reduction occurring during the curing phase. In comparison, Cl.perfringens decreased from 6.3logCFUg(-1) down to 2.4logCFUg(-1) but mainly in the thermal phase of the composting process.
   ConclusionsComposting of biosolids is a more effective means of inactivating Cl.difficile compared to land application.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyWindrow composting represents an effective method to reduce the environmental burden of Cl.difficile associated with biosolids.

AB  - The suitability of traditional microbial indicators (i.e., Escherichia coli and enterococci) has been challenged due to the lack of correlation with pathogens and evidence of possible regrowth in the natural environment. In this study, the relationships between alternative microbial indicators of potential human fecal contamination (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Methanobrevibacter smithii, human polyomaviruses [HPyVs], and F+ and somatic coliphages) and pathogens (Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, rotavirus, astrovirus, norovirus GI, norovirus GII, and adenovirus) were compared with those of traditional microbial indicators, as well as environmental parameters (temperature, conductivity, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, total organic carbon, total suspended solids, turbidity, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus). Water samples were collected from surface waters of urban catchments in Singapore. Salmonella and P. aeruginosa had significant positive correlations with most of the microbial indicators, especially E. coli and enterococci. Norovirus GII showed moderately strong positive correlations with most of the microbial indicators, except for HPyVs and coliphages. In general, high geometric means and significant correlations between human-specific markers and pathogens suggest the possibility of sewage contamination in some areas. The simultaneous detection of human-specific markers (i.e., B. thetaiotaomicron, M. smithii, and HPyVs) with E. coli and enterococcus supports the likelihood of recent fecal contamination, since the human-specific markers are unable to regrow in natural surface waters. Multiple-linear-regression results further confirm that the inclusion of M. smithii and HPyVs, together with traditional indicators, would better predict the occurrence of pathogens. Further study is needed to determine the applicability of such models to different geographical locations and environmental conditions.

AB  - In this paper, the ostracod assemblages identified in three alluvial units preserved in Bardenas Reales de Navarra (Ebro Basin, NE Iberian Peninsula) have been studied, with the aim of reconstructing the palaeoenvironmental evolution of this area during the late Holocene. The most common ostracod species in the studied samples are Ilyocypris bradyi Sars and Paralimnocythere aff. psammophila (Flossner), accompanied by Pseudocandona albicans (Brady). Variations in their relative abundance along these alluvial units allow us to characterize internal changes in the depositional environment. Thus, the unit deposited between 4763 +/- 87 and 2848 +/- 55 years cal. BP is dominated by I. bradyi, indicating the presence of small streams with running water developed probably in fluvial flood plains. Nevertheless, from 2848 +/- 55 to 836 +/- 65 years cal. BP Paralimnocythere aff. psammophila is the dominant species, representing the establishment of an ephemeral and stagnant aquatic environment, mainly related with more arid climatic conditions (Medieval Warm Period). Finally, the ostracod assemblage identified in Recent times (191 +/- 97 to 127 +/- 82 years cal. BP) is mainly dominated by I. bradyi, which indicates the presence of running waters. This later assemblage probably defines the influence of cold and wet climatic phase (Little Ice Age) during Recent times in this area. The palaeoenvironmental evolution identified from the late Holocene according to ostracod assemblages in Bardenas Reales de Navarra shows good correlation with rapid climatic changes deduced from other continental records of the NE Iberian Peninsula.

AB  - The realization that ecosystem services (ES) are in decline prompted endeavors to quantify them in an attempt to secure ES provision while rewarding ES suppliers. Quantifying ES is expected to enhance the implementation of sustainable land use systems, like alley cropping systems for woody biomass production (ACS) which integrate strips of fast growing trees into agricultural fields, creating a win win situation for both farmers and society. In this context, developing an easy to use method, accessible to stakeholders with varying backgrounds, is necessary in order to facilitate comparison of ES provision with respect to different land use practices. This study aimed at assessing five regulating services, i.e., carbon sequestration, soil fertility, erosion control, water regulation, and water quality; and one supporting service, i.e., habitat provision, with a tool which had been developed following an empirical approach. The tool is requiring easily accessible data as an input, while linking the selected ES with a set of indicators as an output. Nine indicators were selected and elaborated in the present study. Across German conditions, the functionality of the tool was verified within different scenarios for conventional agriculture (CA) and ACS with various tree proportions. The plausibility of the results obtained was confirmed by related literature. The results suggest improvement in the ES provision of habitat, erosion control, soil fertility, water quality, and carbon sequestration by ACS as compared to CA. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the context of artificial groundwater recharge, a reactive soil column at pilot-scale (4.5 m depth and 3 m in diameter) fed by treated wastewater was designed to evaluate soil filtration ability. Here, as a part of this project, the impact of treated wastewater filtration on soil bacterial communities and the soil's biological ability for wastewater treatment as well as the relevance of the use of multi-bioindicators were studied as a function of depth and time. Biomass; bacterial 16S rRNA gene diversity fingerprints; potential nitrifying, denitrifying, and sulfate-reducing activities; and functional gene (nano, nir, nar, and dsr) detection were analyzed to highlight the real and potential microbial activity and diversity within the soil column. These bioindicators show that topsoil (0 to 20 cm depth) was the more active and the more impacted by treated wastewater filtration. Nitrification was the main activity in the pilot. No sulfate-reducing activity or dsr genes were detected during the first 6 months of wastewater application. Denitrification was also absent, but genes of denitrifying bacteria were detected, suggesting that the denitrifying process may occur rapidly if adequate chemical conditions are favored within the soil column. Results also underline that a dry period (20 days without any wastewater supply) significantly impacted soil bacterial diversity, leading to a decrease of enzyme activities and biomass. Finally, our work shows that treated wastewater filtration leads to a modification of the bacterial genetic and functional structures in topsoil.

AB  - The Changjiang (Yangtze) River estuary has been subject to a variety of anthropogenic pressures in recent decades. To assess the ecological health of the coastal benthic ecosystem adjacent to the estuary, three surveys were conducted in 2005, 2009, and 2010. The AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) and multivariate-AMBI (M-AMBI) were used to analyse the benthic ecological status of this coast. The AMBI indicate that the ecological status of the coast adjacent to the Changjiang River estuary was only slightly degraded in all 3 years. In contrast, the M-AMBI indicated that the ecological status was seriously degraded, a result that is most likely due to pollution and eutrophication induced by human activities. The assessment of the coast's ecological status by the AMBI was not in agreement with that of the M-AMBI at some stations because of lower biodiversity values at those sites. The analysis of the two indices integrated with abiotic parameters showed that the M-AMBI could be used as a suitable bio-indicator index to assess the benthic ecological status of the coast adjacent to the Changjiang River estuary. The reference conditions proposed for the coast of the Changjiang River estuary should be further evaluated in future studies. Designation of local species could also provide an important reference for Chinese waters. To improve the reliability of AMBI and M-AMBI, further research into the ecology of local species is required to understand their arrangement in ecological groups.

AB  - Changes in the lipid peroxidation and oxidatively modified protein levels as well as the antioxidant defense system in the blood of white stork (Ciconia ciconia) chicks were analyzed during their development in nests in polluted and control environments. The control, relatively pure, environment was the village of Kopot, with no industrial plants within a radius of 150 km. Blood samples were also collected in two polluted areas, including (1) the suburban village of Czarnowo, located 20 km from the city of Zielona Gra (southwestern Poland) and (2) an area near the town of Gogw, where a large copper smelter is situated. The effects of various ecological threats from different environments tended to initiate oxidative stress and decrease total antioxidant capacity. The initiation of lipid peroxidation and increases in the levels of carbonyl derivatives of oxidative amino acids were observed in the plasma of chicks from polluted areas. Plasma catalase and the selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase activities of erythrocytes were significantly higher in chicks from polluted areas than in those from control areas. Oxidative stress and components of the antioxidant defense system, especially glutathione peroxidase activity, can be used as indicators of oxidative stress, which was found to be greater in the polluted areas (near the Gogw copper smelter). Research into oxidative stress biomarkers can aid assessments of the conditions of birds, and points to a positive association with miscellaneous environmental loads.

AB  - It has been proposed that the herbicide atrazine may increase rates of parasitic trematode infection in amphibians. This effect may occur indirectly as a result of increased biomass of periphyton and augmented populations of aquatic snails, which are the trematode's primary larval host. Evidence has also shown that nutrients alone may induce the same indirect responses. Since both atrazine and nutrients commonly enter surface waters from agricultural run-off, their spatial and temporal co-occurrence are highly probable. In light of recent wide-spread declines in amphibian populations, a better understanding of the role of atrazine in the proposed ecological mechanism is necessary. A microcosm study was conducted to quantify biomass of phytoplankton and periphyton over a range of atrazine and phosphorus concentrations (from 0 to 200 mu g L-1 each) using a central composite rotatable design. Over 10 weeks, biomass and water chemistry were monitored using standard methods. Regression and canonical analyses of the response surfaces for each parameter were conducted. We found significant effects of atrazine and phosphorus on dissolved oxygen, pH, and conductivity throughout the study. Additions of phosphorus mitigated the apparent inhibition of these photosynthetic indicators caused by atrazine. Despite these changes, no consistent treatment-related differences in algal biomass were observed. These results indicate that the indirect impacts of atrazine on total growth of periphyton and likely, subsequent effects on aquatic snails, are not expected to be ecologically significant at the concentrations of atrazine tested (up to 200 mu g L-1) and over a range of nutrient conditions commonly occurring in agroecosystems.

AB  - Wood used as fuel under conditions of urban poverty is a source of air pollution. Fuelwood is harvested from pen-urban green areas or sourced as waste from industry or commerce, and used in the informal economy, both by households and by productive activities such as roadside catering. End-of-life timber may have previously been treated for protection, sometimes by impregnation with chromated copper arsenate (CCA). Combustion of CCA-treated timber could magnify the health and environmental risks associated with air pollution, as a result of the release of arsenic and chromium in toxic and carcinogenic forms. Fuelwood supplies of roadside caterers in the urban settlements of Nyanga and Khayelitsha were randomly sampled and 86 collected specimens were prepared for analysis. A further 12 samples were taken, based on their appearance, from households and caterers in settlements near Stellenbosch, Worcester and Paarl. Shavings from the timber specimens were microwave digested using nitric acid and analysed using inductively coupled plasma analysis. All samples collected in the first round showed low concentrations of Cr, Cu and As, believed to be representative of natural backgrounds. Of the 12 pen-urban samples collected in the second round, 8 showed higher levels, typical of treatment to H2-H5 standards. Once it was clear that appearance was a fair indicator of treatment, a further set of 18 suspect pieces from caterers' supplies in Langa, Nyanga, Khayelitsha and Kayamandi were tested, of which at least 1 sample from each area was found to be treated. CCA-treated timber was found infrequently in fuel supplies of urban caterers, and more frequently in peri-urban areas. Further research and interventions to limit health and environmental risks are recommended.

AB  - Municipal wastewater discharges constitute a major source of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) to coastal waters, yet uncertainty exists regarding their linkage to adverse biological effects such as endocrine disruption. Limited information is available concerning the types and fate of CECs discharged to the Southern California Bight (SCB) from municipal wastewater and their potential for ecological impacts. The present study investigated the impacts of CECs from ocean wastewater discharges on SCB fish. Concentrations of CECs were measured in effluents from four major municipal wastewater dischargers. Seawater, sediment, and hornyhead turbot (Pleuronichthys verticalis) from the discharge sites and a reference area were collected and analyzed for chemical and biological indicators. Low concentrations of pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and industrial and commercial compounds were measured in effluent. Some CECs were also detected in sediment, seawater, and fish livers near the outfalls, confirming exposure to CECs. Fish plasma hormone analyses suggested the presence of physiological effects, including a reduced stress response, altered estrogen synthesis or estrogenic exposure, and reduced thyroxine. Most fish responses were found at all sites and could not be directly associated with effluent discharges. However, concentrations of thyroxine were lower at all discharge sites relative to the reference, and estradiol concentrations were lower at three of the four outfall sites. The physiological responses found were not associated with adverse impacts on fish reproduction or populations. Interpretation of molecular and physiological measurements in field organisms such as those used in the present study is challenging because of a lack of information on baseline conditions and uncertain linkages to apical endpoints such as survival and reproduction.

AB  - The objective of this review is to summarize the results of remote sensing in the assessment of the ecological status of surface waters and in surmounting the spatial and temporal scale issues manifested in monitoring according to the Water Framework Directive (WFD). Remote sensing of water quality has undergone significant development during the past four decades. Some ecological quality elements important in WFD can be determined with adequate precision in a wide concentration range by near-surface, airborne, and satellite remote sensing (primarily chlorophyll-a, suspended solids, and dissolved organic matter). With remote sensing methods, it is possible to distinguish algal phyla using remote sensing of pigments other than chlorophyll-a. Remote sensing is also applicable for reviewing distribution, coverage, and association structure of macrophytes. Some hydromorphological characteristics of water bodies, certain pollution sources in their catchment areas, as well as land cover and land use conditions of a river basin, which all combine to express its ecological status, can be analyzed by this method as well. Aspects of environmental quality that do not affect radiation can be reviewed by remote sensing only if they have a relationship with remotely sensed characteristics. Some ground truth data is still needed for remote sensing in many cases. The precision of satellite remote sensing is lower than the near-surface version, but it still can fulfill the "five classes" criteria of WFD-compliant classification. Finally, remote sensing may be a useful tool in extending the spatial and temporal validity of ground data of some quality elements according to WFD, as well as helping methodological intercalibration among countries.

AB  - This study is aimed to characterize the shallow groundwater system in the coastal area between the Uniti and Bevano rivers ( southern part of the Po plain), where salinization is threatening the coastal ecosystems and posing a major environmental issue for the phreatic water management in the coast. A thin rainwater lens is present at the top of the aquifer in the backshore area and its extent has a seasonal variability. These few centimetres of freshwater represent a thin interface between sea water and the delicate coastal ecosystems, such as those of dunes and wetlands. To have a better understanding of the changes in groundwater chemistry, we performed a seasonal monitoring of the water quality at the top of the aquifer. Effective concentrations of chemicals and actual values of physical-chemical parameters in the rainwater lens could be measured by means of auger holes. The analysis of the cation-exchange process in the aquifer was made through the application of the Base Exchange index (BEX index) of Stuyfzand (2008), an indicator of salinization or freshening of waters. The results pointed out that a salinization process is taking place in the largest part of the aquifer. Extension and chemical composition of the rainwater lens are strongly influenced by anthropogenic factors such as drainage and land use. The surface water bodies are all brackish to salty and characterized by anoxic and reducing conditions. At present, only halophytes are present around the dune slacks, which have turned into brackish to hypersaline lakes (C) Copyright. 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The rate of the Halliard reaction and the nature of its products are governed by the immediate chemical environment of the reactants defined by the chemical composition of the system. The fast developing marker has the advantage of providing a tool to follow early changes, even when quality has not changed, and ills still possible to take corrective actions.0
   The aim of present work was to compare the kinetics of color development during the heat treatment under different conditions, in order to define suitable markers to sensitively assess the degree of reactions taking place in milk model systems accounting for the time-temperature effects. The increase in color intensity was followed in two milk model systems (Casein and lactose - CN-L and casein, whey protein concentrate and lactose - CN-WPC-L) at two pH values (6.6 and 7.5) in different buffer solution (0.7 M phosphate and 0.2 M acetate).
   The extent of changes measured by the increase in browning index could be described by a first-order fractional conversion model, resulting in activation energy of 37.07 +/- 1.4 kJ.mol-1 and 21.48 +/- 1.6 kJmol-1 for CN-L and respectively CN-WPC-L systems in 0.7M phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 and 16.5 +/- 1.65 kJ.mol-1 and 26.5 +/- 2.1 kJ.mol-1 for CN-WPC-L system at pH 7.5 and respectively 6.6 in 0.2 M acetate buffer.

AB  - Since 2000, virtually every major assessment of ocean policy has called for implementing an ecosystem approach to managing marine resources, yet crafting such an approach has proved difficult. Ecosystems today exhibit little of the abundance and complexity found in the past, and populations of over-fished species have declined dramatically world-wide, yet historical evidence has been difficult to assimilate into complex ecosystem models. Here, we look to the testimony of Gulf of Maine fishermen for insights on the abundance of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and the environment that once supported such large numbers of them. Using logbook data from Frenchman's Bay, Maine, and other New England communities at the time of the Civil War, we estimate cod landings in the Gulf of Maine in 1861, establish a population structure for cod at that time, and map the geographical distribution of fishing effort of a fleet that minimized risk and cut expenses by fishing inshore where cod and bait species were plentiful. Log entries list the pelagic and bottom-dwelling invertebrate species these fishermen used for bait, when and how they acquired it, and what species they looked for in the water to signify the presence of cod. Ranked descriptions of both cod and bait abundance were found to be statistically significant indicators of cod catch. Frenchman's Bay fishermen 140 years ago provided a minimum set of ecosystem requirements for abundant cod, conditions that may inform management plans aimed at restoring both the species and the Gulf of Maine marine ecosystem.

TI  - Analysis of natural and social dynamics of fishery production systems in Parana, Brazil: implications for management and sustainability
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Sustainability and management issues are discussed for eight fishery production systems (FPS) in the state of Parana, Brazil, from an interdisciplinary perspective. FPS were defined after a set of multidisciplinary classification criteria, in an attempt to conceive fishing activities as a new level of integration between natural and social systems. Systems were compared using the Rapid Appraisal of Fisheries Status (RAPFISH) methodology, with 48 scored attributes, grouped in five evaluation fields (ecological, economic, social, technological and political). Systems were also analyzed for a subset of 14 attributes selected as sustainability indicators. All systems from Parana showed a poor sustainability profile, yet for different reasons. Two groups of systems proved consistent: traditional systems, and the motorized shrimp trawl systems on the coastal shelf. The traditional systems are historically ancient, employ little technology, show a large diversity of fishing practices, and preserve traditional management. The second is a modern group of systems, with a gradient of technological intensification from motor pirogues or canoes to entrepreneurial trawlers; these systems are market-oriented, intensive and ecologically aggressive, but their fishermen have better living conditions. The methodology showed a great potential for offering interdisciplinary interpretations of fishery dynamics, especially in situations of scant information and several systems to compare. Yet, the analysis of sustainability proved strongly affected by the choice of attributes, which necessarily constitute a small, oversimplified fraction of reality. Management should seek a broader consideration of the complexity of socioeconomic and natural processes that govern fisheries in order to recognize differences among systems and adequately address particular development issues and critical points. A viable way to do this could be the consideration of the fishery system as a management unit, with greater participation of stakeholders to better understand the specificities and particular needs of the systems.

AB  - Bivalve species, especially mussels, are biomass dominants in many deep-sea chemosynthetic ecosystems. As in shallow-water environments, parasites are likely to be important factors in the population dynamics of bivalve communities in chemosynthetic ecosystems, but there has been little study of parasitism in deep-sea seep or vent molluscs. In this study, Parasite types, diversity, prevalence, infection density and non-infectious indicators of stress or disease as related to host age, reproductive condition, and endosymbiont density were assessed in mussels (Bathmodiolus heckerae) from 2 seep sites and mussels (B. puteoserpentis) from 2 vent sites. We identified 10 microbial or parasitic agents in histological sections. Parasite types included 3 viral-like gut inclusions. 2 rickettsia-like gill inclusions, a rickettsia-like mantle inclusion, a bacterial gill-rosette, a chlamydia-like gut inclusion, gill-dwelling ciliates, and an unidentified inclusion in gut tissues. Parasite species richness was greater in seep mussels than in vent mussels, with the seep mussels possessing 9 types of parasites compared to 2 in the vent mussels. One of the viral-like inclusions infecting the seep mussel B. heckerae was pathogenic, causing lysis of the digestive tubules. The prevalence and intensity of infection by this pathogen were greater in hosts with shell lengths less than 100 mm. Mussels from all 4 sites also exhibited intense infiltration of tissues and blood spaces by enlarged hemocytes. Hemocytic infiltration (hemocytosis) showed variable degrees of severity that were not associated with other host factors examined.

AB  - In order to evaluate the sensitivity of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems to climatic changes, lithological (sediment structure and color, grain size, physical properties) rind biochemical (TOC, TOC/TN, delta(13)C Of TOC and carbonates) investigations were carried out on an 11.12 m-long sediment core from Lama Lake (Central Siberia, Putorana Plateau). According to the pollen data, the sequence represents the termination of the Pleistocene, and the entire Holocene. It is composed of highly terrigenous and stratified clays and silts. Sediment structure, grain-size distribution, carbonate contents and physical properties of the sediment indicate that glaciers were present in the catchment area of Lama Lake during the period Oldest Dryas to Allerod. For the same time period, delta(13)C values of TOC give indications of a perennial ice cover. Since the Allerod, organic matter accumulation has increased, caused by cm increasing input of land vegetation and aquatic primary production as revealed by relations TOC contents, TOC/TN ratios and delta(13)C values of TOC. During the Holocene climatic optimum, in late Preboreal and Boreal times, biogenic primary production in Lama Lake reached its maximum and the vegetation in the catchment area changed from grassy tundra to a dense forest. From the Atlantic period to the present, small variations in delta(13)C values Of TOC and TOC contents are probably related to the location of Lama Lake on the border between grass and wooded steppe, leading to responses of environmental conditions to even small changes in climate.

AB  - It is well known that crop monoculture can induce negative effects on soil ecosystems and crop productivity. However, little is known about how vegetable monoculture affects the soil nematode community structure and its relationship with vegetable yields. In this study, the composition, abundance, metabolic footprint, and ecological indices of soil nematodes are investigated in monocultures of pumpkin and melon. The relationships between nematode community structure and yields of pumpkin and melon were analyzed by linear regression. Both monoculture soils of pumpkin and melon suppressed the relative abundance of bacterivores but increased the relative abundance of plant parasites. Pumpkin monoculture soils decreased soil nematode diversity but increased the maturity index of plant parasites. Monoculture soils of pumpkin and melon decreased the metabolic footprint of lower- and higher-level trophic groups of the soil food web, respectively. Pumpkin and melon monoculture soils increased the food web indices channel index (CI) but decreased the enrichment index (EI) and the structure index (SI). The monoculture soils of pumpkin and melon led to a more fungal-dominated decomposition pathway and degraded soil food web conditions. The abundance of bacterivores and food web indices EI and SI were positively correlated with soil nutrients and pH, while the abundance of plant parasites and CI were negatively correlated with soil nutrients and pH. Paratylenchus was negatively correlated with pumpkin and melon yields and could be the potential plant parasites threatening pumpkin and melon productions. Redundancy analysis showed that monocultures of pumpkin and melon altered the soil nematode community via soil properties; total N, total P, alkeline-N, and pH were the main driving factors.

AB  - Soil bacteria play a key role in the plant-soil system and can regulate the growth of Phoebe bournei seedlings under fertilization. However, there are few reports on how soil bacteria respond to fertilization and regulate seedling growth. This study adopted the "3414" field fertilization experiment, combined with soil microbial sequencing, nutrient contents, and biomass measurement, to explore the changes of soil chemical properties and bacterial structure under different NPK fertilization conditions and to establish the coupling relationship between soil bacteria, soil nutrients, and plant growth. The results showed that NPK fertilization decreased soil pH; increased soil N, P, and K content; reduced bacterial diversity and abundance; promoted the growth of dominant bacterial species; and enhanced Phoebe bournei seedlings' soil N, P, and K elements. NPK fertilization promoted Proteobacteria growth, especially of three genera (Methylobacterium, Sphingobium, and Acinetobacter) and Actinobacteria, while it decreased Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi. By reducing the ratio of N to K and increasing P, NPK fertilization can slow soil acidification, promote bacterial reproduction, maintain P. bournei seedlings' soil ecological stability, and balance the seedlings' growth and sustainable soil utilization. AD3, Pseudomonas, and Rhodanobacter can be used as the marker species for N, P, and K fertilization, respectively, while Methylobacterium, Brevundimonas, Acinetobacter, and Sphingobium can be used as indicator species for soil pH and soil N, P, and K content changes, respectively. These results provided a theoretical basis and technical guidance for the effective fertilization and cultivation of robust P. bournei seedlings.

AB  - The forest ecosystems of Tibet function as important carbon sinks. However, previous estimates of carbon budgets have included large uncertainties owing to the limitations of data acquisition and the method of estimation. In this study, IPCC and model estimation methods have been used to calculate all the sectors of carbon stocks in typical forest vegetation of Tibet and explore the biogeographical patterns and potential drivers of these pools. The results showed that the total carbon pools of biomass and dead organic matter in six typical forest ecosystems in Tibet was 457.67 Tg C, of which 10.52-164.85 Tg C (76.53%) was stored in aboveground biomass, 1.87-59.37 Tg C (22.07%) in belowground biomass, 0.01-2.75 Tg C (0.73%) in the forest understory, 0.02-1.57 Tg C (0.53%) in litter, and 0.01-0.27 Tg C (0.14%) in dead wood. These carbon reserves are primarily distributed in mature and over mature forests, comprising 48.89% and 31.58%, respectively. Geographical location and natural conditions affect the carbon sequestration capacity of the Tibetan forest ecosystems that decreases from southeast to northwest. An analysis also suggests that the canopy and tree densities have some effect on the carbon sequestration efficiency in different carbon pools. This is primarily because these two indicators have a greater impact on the growth of trees. In addition, it was found that the forests of Abies fabri and Platycladus orientalis had the highest and lowest degrees of carbon fixation, respectively.

AB  - Hydrological regime disturbances in riparian ecosystems affect the interactions between soil properties and vegetation. The proper assessment of changes occurring in river valley forests is a basis for planning in sustainable forest management. The existing habitat conditions in plant communities can be assessed by both direct and indirect measurements. The aim of the study was to compare the results obtained with direct and indirect methods of data collection. We also evaluated the validity of the studied variables. Our study was based on data from plots established in 90-year-old forests in the Odra river valley (SW Poland). Habitat features, such as soil moisture (F), nitrogen (N), and soil reaction (R), were expressed directly using field measurements and indirectly using Ellenberg's indicator values, calculated based on the presence/absence of species in a plot (aEIVs) as well as on species cover (wEIVs). Only in the case of nitrogen did the use of both methods of estimating habitat features give the same results for selected riverside forests. In ordination and regressive analyses, use of direct or indirect methods strongly influences the results of calculations. Analyses conducted on the basis of selected parameters indicate a significant decrease in soil moisture and a change in soil reaction in the riparian forest located on the edge of the floodplain, which indicates that the habitat transformation has already begun. We concluded that the use of Ellenberg's indicator values (EIVs) for monitoring riparian habitats has numerous disadvantages, and therefore data based on direct measurement should be preferred.

AB  - Sustainable fisheries management requires accurate stock assessment and an understanding of how targeted populations vary over space and time and respond to external stressors. Commercial fishery catch rate data (i.e. catch per unit of effort; CPUE) are widely used to assess fishery performance and can provide a measure of stock abundance. However, changes in environmental conditions can influence the two determinants of CPUE, i.e. catchability (q) and abundance (N). We explore the influence of environmental variables (water temperature, wind speed, rainfall, freshwater flow, wave height, lunar illumination, tide height and depth) on commercial blue swimmer crab Portunus armatus CPUE in five Western Australian fisheries. Generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) were used to identify which variables had the greatest influence on CPUE, and enabled predictions of how these can vary with environmental change. Water temperature had a significant positive effect on CPUE in all fisheries, although some fisheries exhibited a CPUE decline above an optimal temperature range. Wind speed and tide height had significant and generally positive (but lower magnitude) effects in three of the five fisheries investigated, while lunar illumination and freshwater flow caused a decline in CPUE in two or less fisheries. When annual CPUE were standardised for these significant environmental effects, they displayed clear variation from nominal (raw) CPUE. These results highlight the importance of measuring and accounting for environmental effects (e.g. through catch rate standardisation) when using CPUE for fishery assessments.

AB  - The Permian marine-terrestrial system of the North China block provides an exceptional window into the evolution of northern temperate ecosystems during the critical transition from icehouse to greenhouse following the late Paleozoic ice age (LPIA). Despite many studies on its rich hydrocarbon reserves and climate-sensitive fossil flora, uncertain temporal constraints and correlations have hampered a thorough understanding of the records of geologic, biologic, and climatic change from the North China block. We present a new chronostratigraphy based on high-precision U-Pb chemical abrasion-isotope dilution-thermal ionization mass spectrometry (CA-ID-TIMS) geochronology of tuffs from a near-complete latest Carboniferous-Permian succession in North China. The results indicate that the predominance of continental red beds, climate aridification, and the disappearance of coals and characteristic tropical flora were well under way during the Cisuralian (Early Permian) in the North China block, significantly earlier than previously thought. A nearly 20 m.y. hiatus spanning the early Kungurian to the mid-Guadalupian (or later) is revealed in the northern North China block to have close temporal and spatial associations with the closure and/or subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean and its related tectonic convergence. This long hiatus was concomitant with the prominent loss of the highly diverse and abundant Cathaysian floras and the widespread invasion of the monotonous Angaran floras under arid climate conditions in the North China block. Similarities in the floral and climate shift histories between Euramerica and North China suggest that aside from the regional tectonic controls and continental movement, extensive volcanism during the Cisuralian may have played a major role in the global warming and aridification in the aftermath of the LPIA.

AB  - Carbonate rhizoliths and related features are environmental and ecological indicators of not only palaeosols, but also modern soils. They designate subaerial vadose and pedogenic diagenesis environments. Rhizoliths are commonly used as a tool for paleoenvironmental reconstructions, but uncertainty remains regarding their formation mechanisms. Field characteristics of the dune rhizoliths in the Badain Jaran Desert, NW China were analyzed to investigate formation mechanisms and interpret paleoenvironmental significance. Systematic field sampling and intensive examination showed that the tube-like rhizoliths without morphological structures of plant roots have been placed at the dune soil surface following erosion and weathering but the underground rhizoliths are still connected to the dead Artemisia roots. Rhizoliths occurred only along the windward, long gentle slopes of mega-dunes. Their distribution patterns of both types in connection with plant distribution and landscapes have been studied. Their petrological and mineralogical characters were performed in detail using microscopic and spectroscopic techniques (cathodoluminescence, scanning electronic microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) in laboratory. Altogether, field and laboratory analyses showed that rhizolith cement is calcium carbonate and despite the high porosity of soil and high aridness of climate, soil moisture plays an important role in sustaining Artemisia growth and rhizolith formation. Desert rhizoliths can therefore be used as a proxy to infer local soil moisture and plant communities. Moreover, as soil moisture content is related to climate and landscape position, rhizoliths could indirectly be indicators of aboveground environmental conditions, e.g. annual precipitation or humidity.

AB  - Change in community similarity (e.g., biotic homogenization) is regulated by different types of introduction and extinction events. However, the spatial patterns and potential drivers of these event types have not yet been addressed to date. Here, we used bird species occurrences on 152 oceanic islands worldwide in both historical (similar to 1500 CE) and current periods with the aim to (1) elucidate the variations of these events among islands and archipelagos and (2) disentangle the effects of biogeographical and environmental factors (e.g., spatial distance, island area, climatic conditions, and/or inter-island distance). We found that community similarity increased at both island and archipelago scales after species introductions and extinctions. The introduction and extinction of one species to/from only one island (unique introduction and extinction) comprise most events (>94%). Island area has a positive effect on nearly all event types at both island and archipelago scales, while climate difference generally has a negative effect on these events. Conversely, responses to spatial distance and inter-island distance on different events are more complex than expected. Overall, biogeographical variables (area and distance) seem to explain most of the events followed by climate variables. Yet extinction events at the archipelago level were also highly associated with inter-island distance as an indicator of dispersal limitation. Our findings provide a solid foundation for understanding the event-mediated processes of homogenization and present essential insights into how biogeographical and environmental factors affect different events on islands.

AB  - The city of Cartagena, Colombia, was founded in 1533, making it the fifth oldest, continuously inhabitated colonial city in South America. Today, Cartagena is the fifth largest city in Colombia, with similar to 1.2 million inhabitants. Las Quintas Lagoon lies near the center of Cartagena and is connected hydrologically to the Bay of Cartagena and Las Virgenes Lagoon via channels. The sediments of Las Quintas Lagoon thus offer a unique opportunity to explore the environmental history of one of the oldest cities in South America. We analysed a Pb-210- and C-14-dated sediment core from Las Quintas Lagoon to investigate the environmental effects of long-term urban development in this tropical, estuarine setting. The sediment core from Las Quintas Lagoon displays evidence of change in the depositional environment during the last few centuries. Principal Component Analysis indicated relatively stable conditions in Las Quintas Lagoon from the begining of the record (about 1300 CE) until ca. 1900 CE, when the ongoing eutrophication began. PC1 shows statistical significance and was dominated by geochemical indicators, whereas PC2 correlated with pollen spectra. Upcore decreases in TOC/TN values, together with increases in TOC, TN and delta N-15 values, indicate greater autochthonous (i.e. phytoplankton) production and eutrophication. Lack of statistical significance of PC2 points to low variability among pollen spectra, and hence vegetation, through time. Diatom assemblages in the Las Quintas Lagoon sediment record display two shifts during the last 100 years, ca. 1940 and 2000, which also reflect progressive eutrophication of the system.

AB  - Globally, treeline in mountain landscapes is reported to be sensitive to projected warming by climate change. Betula utilis (Himalayan birch), a principal tree species defining the natural treeline in Himalayas, is a potential indicator species to track the signal of climate change. The present study models the ensemble distribution of B. utilis using Biomod2 package for present and future (RCP's 2.6-8.5 covering 2050 and 2070). The final ensemble model obtained had AUC=0.886 and TSS=0.655, thus indicating robustness of the model. We assessed change in the habitat suitability, area expansion and contraction based on ensemble model using SDM Toolbox. The highly suitable area for B. utilis is predicted to shift towards the eastern parts of Himalayas in future, with suitability declining towards the western part of Himalayas. The study, to our best knowledge, for the first time used Ecospat package to assess niche dynamics (i.e. overlap, similarity and equivalency) of B. utilis, which predicted the climatic niche of this treeline species is moderately shifting in future scenarios. Further, the PCA analysis indicated that significant variation (33.45% on PC1 and 24.63% on PC2) exists in the climatic conditions between current and future scenarios. The similarity and equivalency test revealed that B. utilis niche is similar but not identical between current and future climate change scenarios. Hopefully, the results from the present study will contribute significantly in understanding the impacts of climate change in Himalayas with wide implications for scientifically-informed adaptation and mitigation strategies.

AB  - Due to the lack of regulated drugs for aquaculture, the present study considered specific issues relating to environmental and food safety aspects concerning the potential use of emamectin benzoate (EMA) in freshwater fishes such as tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) - an important commercial fish species worldwide. The residual depletion of EMA (EMA-B-1a) in fillet (muscle plus skin in natural proportions) of tilapia treated with a daily dose of 50 mu g/kg BW during seven consecutive days was evaluated. To facilitate this, analytical methods for quantitation of EMA in fish feed and in fish fillet employing LC-MS/MS were developed and validated. To eliminate the risk of EMA leaching from feed into the aquatic environment during fish medication via oral administration, a promising procedure for drug incorporation into feed involving the coating of feed pellets with ethyl cellulose polymer containing EMA was evaluated. The medicated feed exhibited good homogeneity (CV < 2.1%) with negligible EMA release (< LOQ) when the medicated feed remained in the water for up to 20 min. Depletion study analysis revealed the highest EMA concentration obtained in fish fillet to be 13.3 ng/g. Therefore, under the employed rearing conditions of this study, the obtained results did not evidence requirement for a minimum withdrawal period to be proposed considering the maximum residue limit of 100 mu g/g for fish muscle. In response to the well-recognized demands and need for new alternative veterinary drugs for use within aquaculture, this study offers impetus for consideration of EMA use in tilapia taking into account environmental contamination and food safety issues.

AB  - Rafting invertebrate species represent an important link for the dispersal and colonisation of islands in the Southern Ocean. They are sensitive to changes in hydrodynamics through effects on transport and food availability, particularly in the case of filter-feeding species. This gives them the potential to act as sentinels of environmental change. The rafting kelp-associated Gaimardia trapesina is one such species, widely distributed in the Southern Ocean. In 2015 and 2016, the size structure, diet, and distribution of G. trapesina were examined around the Sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (PEI) to establish benchmark data and explore their potential use for monitoring long-term change. Gaimardia trapesina and its potential food sources were collected and analysed for size structure, attachment strength, and diet, using stable isotope and fatty acid analyses. The populations examined were dominated by relatively small individuals. The strength of attachment to kelp blades was low and the byssal threads showed high elasticity. The PEI lie in the path of the west-east flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the highest abundances of G. trapesina were found on the downstream sides of both islands, while the species was absent from the western, upstream coasts. Both diet analyses and SIAR mixing models indicated that G. trapesina feeds on suspended particulate matter, while kelp particles contribute minimally to the diet. Considering the wide distribution of G. trapesina, its importance as food for birds and fish, and its sensitivity to environmental conditions, there is good potential to use this species as an indicator of environmental change in the Southern Ocean.

AB  - In this paper, a detailed vegetation and environmental reconstruction for the Lateglacial interstadial in the Moervaart area (NW Belgium) is discussed, in relation to former human occupation patterns. This reconstruction is based on a multi-disciplinary research carried out on calcareous deposits of a large palaeolake (-25 km (2)). The combination of physical (magnetic susceptibility, micromorphology, organic matter, calcium carbonate), botanical (pollen, macrofossils, diatoms), zoological (chironomids, molluscs, ostracods) and chemical analyses (stable carbon and oxygen isotopes) allowed for a highly detailed reconstruction of the lake ecosystem and vegetation surrounding the lake. The chronology of the lake record was provided by radiocarbon dating and comparison with the nearby Rieme sites and regional biostratigraphy.
   During the Bolling phase, the Moervaart palaeolake formed as result of a major rise of the groundwater table in the area. Water level rise continued during the early Allerod phase and a rich water flora and fauna developed in the lake. From this period onwards, the area provided a suitable landscape for the Federmesser Culture hunter-gatherers with fresh drinking water, extensive and fertile woodlands and lake edges for wild game hunting, plant gathering and fowling. Water levels rose to a maximum at the end of the early Allerod. Thereafter, an outlet for the lake was formed in the east. As a result, water levels gradually decreased during the middle to late Allerod and eventually the Moervaart lake turned into a swamp and ceased to exist. In combination with the prevailing colder conditions, this led to a marked population decrease with probably temporary abandonment ofthe region. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Epibionts can serve as valuable ecological indicators, providing information about the behaviour or health of the host. The use of epibionts as indicators is, however, often limited by a lack of knowledge about the basic ecology of these 'hitchhikers'. This study investigated the growth rates of a turtle barnacle, Chelonibia testudinaria, under natural conditions, and then used the resulting growth curve to estimate the barnacle's age. Repeat morphometric measurements (length and basal area) on 78 barnacles were taken, as host loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) laid successive clutches at Mon Repos, Australia, during the 2015/16 nesting season. Barnacles when first encountered ranged in size from 3.7 to 62.9 mm, and were recaptured between 12 and 56 days later. Fitting the growth measurements of these barnacles to a von Bertalanffy growth curve, we estimated the age of these barnacles as a function of their size. Length growth rate decreased over time in a nonlinear fashion, while basal area growth rate showed a linear relationship with age. The average estimated age of barnacles at first capture was approximately 6 months (barnacle length 30.3 +/- 1.8 mm). The largest and oldest individual had a length of 62.9 mm when first measured, and was estimated to be 642 days old. The finding that C. testudinaria may live for up to 2 years, means that these barnacles may serve as interesting ecological indicators over this period. In turn, this information may be used to better understand the movement and habitat use of their sea turtle hosts, ultimately improving conservation and management of these threatened animals.

AB  - The goal of the present study was to identify the potential changes in ecosystem service values provided by wetlands in Galveston Bay, Texas, USA, under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A1B max (0.69m) sea level rise scenario. Built exclusively upon the output produced during the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model 6 (SLAMM 6) exercise for the Galveston Bay region, this study showed that fresh marsh and salt marsh present a steady decline from 2009 (initial condition) to 2100. Fresh marsh was projected to undergo the biggest changes, with the loss of approximately 21% of its extent between 2009 and 2100 under the A1B max scenario. The percentages of change for salt marsh were less prominent at approximately 12%. This trend was also shown in the values of selected ecosystem services (disturbance regulation, waste regulation, recreation, and aesthetics) provided by these habitats. An ordinary least squares regression was used to calculate the monetary value of the selected ecosystem services provided by salt marsh and fresh marsh in 2009, and in 2050 and 2100 under the A1B max scenario. The value of the selected services showed potential monetary losses in excess of US$40 million annually in 2100, compared to 2009 for fresh marsh and more than $11 million for salt marsh. The estimates provided here are only small portions of what can be lost due to the decrease in habitat extent, and they highlight the need for protecting not only built infrastructure but also natural resources from sea level rise.

AB  - The amount of animal manure produced in Flanders-Belgium by intensive animal farming generates a surplus that needs to be treated in order to achieve quality objectives set by the Nitrates Directive (91/676/EEC) and the European Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EU). After the physical separation and biological nitrification/denitrification processes, the liquid fraction of manure can be cost-efficiently and effectively treated by constructed wetlands (CWs). However, current discharge criteria limits do not evaluate whether nutrient loads from specific point sources (such as CWs) affect the water quality of their receiving waterway. Thus, we investigated whether a site-specific analysis, based on local environmental conditions, would yield more relevant discharge thresholds. In the present study, a standardized framework was developed for environmental impact assessment (EIA) of effluents from CWs on the water quality of receiving watercourses. This framework was tested as a case study on a manure treatment installation located in Langemark-Belgium. The effect of different impact scenarios on water quality and flow of the effluent and the receiving waterway was studied. Standardized EIA guidelines and sensitivity analyses were applied to determine the expected impacts of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (P), chlorides (Cl-) and sulphates (SO42-) on the receiving watercourse. From this study, we concluded that the methodology currently applied requires adaptation when assessing the discharge from wetlands as current estimations of impact are overly conservative when compared with actual impact. In addition, results showed that expected impact might be mitigated by differentiating discharge limits between dry and wet periods.

AB  - This paper describes a two-year study of spatial and temporal patterns and processes in the benthos in response to the removal of salmon cages from a sheltered coastal embayment, coupled with the simultaneous reintroduction of cages at an adjacent location. Significant recovery was evident at the fallowed site in the first six months; however, the macrofaunal assemblage remained impacted at the conclusion of the study. By comparison, the reintroduction of a fully operational farm overwhelmed the macrobenthic community within three months, with anoxic and near-azoic conditions developing. Both removal and reintroduction of the farms triggered alternating oscillations of geochemical and biological variables, which were attributed to effects on sediment chemistry from organic loading, 'boom and bust' cycles of opportunistic taxa in response to food supply, and the associated variations in metabolic potential. The study also revealed interesting spatial dynamics in the benthos and some useful indicators of different stages of recovery and re-impact. It is concluded that farm reintroductions should aim to gradually increase production; allowing time for the benthos to adapt to the additional organic flux, and be maintained at a level that avoids macrofaunal collapse. The sediment's ability to cope with organic inputs from fish farming, and hence the duration of the recovery period, is contingent on the organic load in each farming cycle and the extent to which the sediment community is allowed to recover. Understanding the influence of each of these on sediment processes is important for sustainable long-term management of farming operations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The EU regulations on energy saving have been implemented in Italy with the adoption of the North-European super-insulated model that led to the construction of buildings not much related to their climatic context. The European Directives 2010/31/EU and 2012/27/EU highlighted the importance to consider the specific climate but the development of a technical culture suitable for a temperate climate still remains an open question.
   The aim of the paper is to quantify the effect on energy consumptions, comfort levels, environmental sustainability of the adoption of 3 energy efficient envelopes recently introduced in Mediterranean area and characterized by different thermal inertia (masonry, wood-cement, wood). In order to achieve this goal, a multidisciplinary approach was adopted involving: the study of the energy performance in winter and summer using analytical models both in semi-stationary and dynamic conditions (Termo and EnergyPlus programs) and the detailed analysis of thermal bridges (Therm software); the analysis of the annual comfort through dynamic analysis with Fanger's PMV and adaptive comfort models; the quantification of environmental-economic impacts through LCA analysis (SimaPro software) with Eco-indicator 99, CED, EPS 2000 and IPCC 2001 GWP methods and LCC considering financial and environmental costs.
   The results made it possible to stress the differences between the various adopted methods and demonstrate that in such energy efficient envelopes the thermal mass has low influence on energy saving while it has a great effect on comfort levels and environmental burdens, with a conflicting incidence on these two aspects.

AB  - Food preferences and food availability are two major determinants of the diet of generalist herbivores and of their spatial distribution. How do these factors interact and eventually lead to diet differentiation in co-occurring herbivores? We quantified the diet of four grasshopper species co-occurring in subalpine grasslands using DNA barcoding of the plants contained in the faeces of individuals sampled in the field. The food preferences of each grasshopper species were assessed by a choice (cafeteria) experiment from among 24 plant species common in five grassland plots, in which the four grasshoppers were collected, while the habitat was described by the relative abundance of plant species in the grassland plots. Plant species were characterised by their leaf economics spectrum (LES), quantifying their nutrient vs. structural tissue content. The grasshoppers' diet, described by the mean LES of the plants eaten, could be explained by their plant preferences but not by the available plants in their habitat. The diet differed significantly across four grasshopper species pairs out of six, which validates food preferences assessed in standardised conditions as indicators for diet partitioning in nature. In contrast, variation of the functional diversity (FD) for LES in the diet was mostly correlated to the FD of the available plants in the habitat, suggesting that diet mixing depends on the environment and is not an intrinsic property of the grasshopper species. This study sheds light on the mechanisms determining the feeding niche of herbivores, showing that food preferences influence niche position whereas habitat diversity affects niche breadth.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to characterise 172 Salmonella Typhimurium isolates taken from the pork chain for their biofilm forming abilities and to analyse their potential to survive on food processing surfaces. Many Salmonella have the ability to form biofilms. These natural structures, elaborated by bacteria are important in food production because their formation contributes to bacterial survival. Adherent bacterial cells are more resilient to displacement strategies including physical and chemical procedures as a consequence of their altered more resistant phenotype. By improving our understanding of the nature of biofilms, this data could positively contribute to the development and implementation of eradication strategies. In this study, Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 and DT104b were investigated for their ability to forth biofilms on a range of different surfaces under defined environmental growth conditions. Phenotypic characterisation involved examining colony morphology on indicator agars, assessing their ability to survive chlorine-based challenges and investigating their ability to attach to stainless steel and to plastic surfaces. All bacterial isolates were investigated for the presence of Salmonella genomic island I (SGI1) which is thought to enhance efficient biofilm formation. It was found that the majority of strains possess biofilm forming capabilities but successful attachment is highly dependent on the surface on which the biofilm is forming. The strains readily attached to stainless steel and plastic surfaces and survived high chlorine concentrations. Molecular and phenotypic comparisons of strong and weak biofilm forming strains indicate that biofilm development is not solely dependent on the acquirement of SGI1. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - At present the world market is facing a deficit of beef. In terms of the total world production of meat, buffalo meat contributes 1.3 percent. The quality and quantity of buffalo meat depends on various factors. The most important are breed, age, feeding, natural and artificial environmental conditions. The research was conducted on a total of 30 young male buffaloes, of the Romanian breed, for 10 months. This study analyzes the evolution of body development in buffaloes which can be used for meat production, depending on age, level of feeding, and season. The experiment started when the buffaloes were 8 months old, and had a body weight of 176 kg. At 17 months of age, the animals weighed 454.3 kg, with a total weight gain of 278.3 kg. Daily average weight gain ranged from 750 g at the age of 8 months to 1135 g at 17 months. The highest daily growth in weight was achieved at the age of 12 months in the winter season - 1207 g. During the feeding, young buffalo meat, alfalfa hay or tare hay, green grass or maize silage, and concentrates were used. Every month we made body measurements (body weight, size at withers, the thoracic perimetre, the spiral perimetre of the pulp, oblique length of the body), and at the end of the experiment we calculated synthetic indicators. Thus the size at withers increased from 111 cm (10 months) to 127.4 cm (17 months). The spiral perimetre of the pulp increased to 165 cm at the age of slaughter (17 months).

AB  - Bioaerosols emitted from composting plants are a cause of concern because of their potential impact on occupational health and neighboring residential areas. The aim of this study was to identify microbial indicators that are most useful for monitoring bioaerosol emittance and dispersal by industrial composting plants. Seven microbial indicators were measured in air collected outdoors in natural environments and at eleven composting plants. The indicators were: cultivable bacteria and fungi, total bacteria (epifluorescent microscopy), viable bacteria (solid-phase cytometry) and quantification by qPCR of three microbial indicators which had been previously shown as strongly associated with composting. For each indicator, the increase in concentrations due to the turning of composting piles as compared to the background concentration obtained in natural environments and upwind of composting plants was determined. Based on these results, the most effective combination of three indicators was selected for monitoring composting bioaerosol emissions: viable bacteria as one general indicator of bioaerosol emission and two bacterial phylotypes specific to composting bioaerosol: NA07, affiliated to Saccharopolyspora sp. and NC38, affiliated to the Thermoactinomycetaceae. This set of indicator was then quantified on-site and at increasing distances downwind during the turning of compost windrows in thermophilic phase. Composting activity was considered to affect bioaerosol emission when the concentrations of the three indicators were higher than their respective background levels. For all the composting sites studied, an impact was measureable up to distances of 100 m. Further away, the impact was not systematically observed as it depended on meteorological conditions (wind speed) and on levels of bioaerosol emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent literature, very few studies have reported the use of the combination of indicators from ecological communities and ecotoxicity biomarkers in field experiments to assess agricultural quality. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the influence of three soil management practices of vine inter-rows (chemical weeding, mechanical weeding and grass-covering) on earthworms, in the Gaillac vineyard (South-West France). The sampling, identification and counts of earthworms were performed in spring and autumn over three years in order to determine the influence of the management practices. Focussing on the most abundant species, Aporrectodea nocturna, biomarker assays (glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT) and cholinesterase (ChE) activities) were conducted to check physiological disturbances that are indirectly linked to soil management practices.
   A strong influence of soil management practices was highlighted on earthworm ecology and physiology in the vine inter-rows. Chemical weeding favoured worm proliferation, but proportionally decreased the number of epi-anecic species. Mechanical weeding dramatically decreased the total number of earthworms, both adults and juveniles, and their biomass. Under these soil farming practices, variations of metabolisation and anti-oxidant enzyme activities were observed, suggesting an increase in pesticide bioavailability. Grass-covering seemed to be the best practice, at least from an environmental point of view. Neurotoxicity enzyme (cholinesterase) activity in vineyard earthworms was not affected by pollutants conventionally sprayed on the vineyard, regardless of soil agricultural practice.
   It was concluded that soil management practices can both modify earthworm communities and physiology, inducing variations of the following factors: protection against predators, environmental conditions and availability of pesticide and nutrients.

AB  - This study presents an application of a well-calibrated integrative hydro-ecological model to examine water resources management in the upper and middle parts of the Yellow River basin, an arid and semiarid area in northwestern China. The hydro-ecological model was developed to simulate dynamic and accumulative hydrologic, ecologic, and economic variables at different spatial units. Four water management scenarios based on water use priorities, a business-as-usual scenario, an ecological scenario, an irrigation use efficiency scenario and water use scenario were designed and modeled over the period of 2011-2020 to reflect alternative water management pathways to the future. Water resource conditions were assessed in terms streamflow, actual evapotranspiration, soil water, groundwater yield, overall water yield, and derived indicator of drought index. Unit crop yield was to assess ecological production, and monetary values of crop productivity and water productivity were used to assess economic output. Scenario analysis results suggested that water stress would continue in the study region under both current water use patterns and ecological scenarios of river flow being fully satisfied. Water use scenarios would result in decreased water availability and ecosystem degradation in the long run. Improving irrigation use efficiency would be the most efficient approach in securing long-term water and food supply. The simulation results from this study provided useful information for evaluating long-term water resources management strategies, and will contribute to the knowledge of interdisciplinary modeling for water resources management in the study region.

AB  - It is difficult to estimate groundwater recharge in semiarid environments, where precipitation and evapotranspiration nearly balance. In such environments, groundwater supplies are sensitive to small changes in the processes that control recharge. Numerical modeling provides the temporal resolution needed to analyze these processes but is highly sensitive to model errors. Natural chloride tracer measurements in the unsaturated zone provide more robust indicators of low recharge rates but yield estimates at coarse time scales that mask most control mechanisms. This study presents a new probabilistic approach for analyzing diffuse recharge in semiarid environments, with an application to study sites in the U. S. southern High Plains. The approach uses data assimilation to combine model predictions and chloride-based recharge estimates. It has the advantage of providing probability distributions rather than point values for uncertain soil and vegetation properties. These can then be used to quantify recharge uncertainty. Estimates of moisture flux time series indicate that percolation (or potential recharge) at the data sites is episodic and exhibits interannual variability. Most percolation occurs during intense rains when crop roots are not fully developed and there is ample antecedent soil moisture. El Nino events can contribute to interannual variability of recharge if they bring rainy winters that provide wet antecedent conditions for spring precipitation. Data assimilation methods that combine modeling and chloride observations provide the high temporal resolution information needed to identify mechanisms controlling diffuse recharge and offer a way to examine the effects of land use change and climatic variability on groundwater resources.

AB  - The present study was designed to explore the correlation between the frequency of micronuclei in Trad-MN, measured across 28 biomonitoring stations during the period comprised between 11 of May and 2 of October, 2006, and adjusted mortality rates due to cardiovascular, respiratory diseases and cancer in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, an area with different sources of air pollution. For controlling purposes, mortality rate due to gastrointestinal diseases (an event less prone to be affected by air pollution) was also considered in the analysis. Spatial distribution of micronuclei frequency was determined using average interpolation. The association between health estimators and micronuclei frequency was determined by measures of Pearson's correlation. Higher frequencies of micronuclei were detected in areas with high traffic and close to a petrochemical pole. Significant associations were detected between micronuclei frequency and adjusted mortality rate due to cardiovascular diseases (r = 0.841, p = 0.036) and cancer (r = 0.890, p = 0.018). The association between mortality due to chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases was positive but did not reach statistical significance (r = 0.640, p = 0.172), probably because of the small number of events. Gastrointestinal mortality did not exhibit significant association with micronuclei frequency. Because the small number of observations and the nature of an ecological study, the present findings must be considered with caution and considered as preliminary. Further studies, performed in different conditions of contamination and climate should be done before considering Trad-MN in the evaluation of human health risk imposed by air pollutants.

AB  - A simulation approach which integrates mechanistic models and fuzzy logic in order to accommodate parameter variability is developed and explored. The approach modifies a mechanistic model, such as a runoff model, for which the values of the parameters are originally fixed. Fuzzy logic is used to redefine the parameter values by varying them as a function of meaningful system indicators, such as inflow, precipitation or temperature in the case of inflow modelling. The modification adds flexibility to the structure of the mechanistic model, by allowing the values of the parameters to be reset at every time step based on the current values of the system indicators. This approach is applied to two different models, a runoff model and an algal concentration model, in order to demonstrate its versatility. The results are indicative of improved performance with the hybrid fuzzy-mechanistic models compared with the purely mechanistic models. In the case of the runoff model, the resulting description of the parameter domain also indicates a possible deficiency of the model structure, that is, a lack of clear distinction between watershed runoff and water retention through routing. The approach may be data intensive, but its implementation is straightforward. A wide range of potential applications of this approach in environmental and natural resources descriptive modelling exists, including: snowmelt modelling, fish habitat modelling, transport modelling, and species migration modelling. However, one must be careful to identify parameter-system indicator relationships that are representative of the system under study, and to avoid extrapolations beyond the known system conditions.

AB  - The conservation status of the snake fauna of a given region or territory is often hard to estimate due the secretive habits of these animals, as well as of the lack of long-term demographic studies and generally low population densities. We examined the conservation status of the snakes from the Iberian Peninsula by applying two complementary methods. The first method, created by Filippi and Luiselli for a study of the Italian snakes conservation status, takes into account the ecological and non-ecological attributes which make species vulnerable to extinction. The second is a cartographic analysis which consists of calculating two indexes derived from the comparison of old and recent citations in UTM 10 x 10 km squares of Iberian snakes by means of extensive database sets. For each species, we calculated the percentage of recent citations, and the percentage of squares with both old and recent citations. Species with low proportion of recent citations and new squares appeared to be in decline. We found considerable coincidence between the two methods in the identification of the most threatened snake species: Vipera latastei, Coronella girondica, and Natrix natrix. We suspect that the ecological specialisation and the low reproductive output make C girondica and V latastei prone to extinction when faced with environmental changes (i.e. habitat loss). For N. natrix, we argue that this semi-aquatic snake experiences suboptimal environmental conditions in Mediterranean habitats. A combination of both methods proved adequate to detect vulnerability to extinction of snake species, hence revealing an effective tool for establishing conservation strategies in snakes and other secretive faunas.

AB  - Behavioural observations were made of South American sea lions Otaria flavescens in Peru to determine whether changes in their diet and maternal attendance patterns reflected physical changes in the marine environment and alterations in the abundance and distribution of prey. The study was conducted during the breeding season between 1998 and 2002, which was a period that encompassed a strong El Nino (1997 to 1998) and a moderate La Nina (1999 to 2001). Observations revealed strong linkages between maternal attendance patterns and the abundance of prey and oceanographic features close to the rookeries. Acute prey shortage during El Nino resulted in females increasing the length of their foraging trips and decreasing the time they spent onshore with their pups. In contrast, shorter times at sea and longer times onshore were observed during the favourable conditions of La Nina when preferred prey (anchovy and squat lobster) were more abundant near the rookeries. Pup mortalities increased when females spent more time at sea searching for prey and did not return frequently enough to nurse their pups. A larger diversity of prey species (particularly of demersal fishes) was consumed during El Nino when anchovy and lobster were less available. Females appeared to adjust their diets and maternal attendance patterns in response to annual changes in the abundance and distribution of prey. These observations suggested that diet and maternal responses reflect interannual fluctuations of the unpredictable Peruvian upwelling ecosystem, and implied that South American sea lions may be good indicators of relative changes in the distribution and abundance of marine resources.

AB  - Natural abundances of carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 were analyzed in 3-year bands of annual rings of three red pine (Pinus densiflora Sieb. et Zucc.) trees in eastern Korea to elucidate their variations in relation to changing environmental conditions, particularly air pollution. Tree ring width had a trend to decrease with time (r = -0.79, P < 0.001); however, tree-ring indices did not show any consistent pattern of change over time. Tree ring indices were correlated neither with the respective precipitation nor temperature. The delta(13)C (range: -25.7 to -24.4%) of tree rings became less negative as tree ring indices increase (r = 0.43, P < 0.05), suggesting that radial growth of trees might have been affected by environmental factors such as nutrient deficiency and acid rain that affect carboxylation efficiency. Increasing N concentration (range: 0.40 to 0.68 g N kg(-1)) with decreasing delta(15)N (range: +4.2 to -0.6%) of tree rings ( r = -0.84, P < 0.01) during the period (since 1980s) of increasing NOx emission in Korea was consistent with the hypothesis that increasing deposition of N depleted in N-15 may lead to N-15 depletion in tree tissues. However, quantitative information on inter-ring translocation of N which may cause N isotopic fractionation is necessary to use the delta(15)N signal as a reliable indicator of air pollution.

AB  - Sedimentary and faunal characteristics of the Lower Devonian Man On The Hill (MOTH) vertebrate-bearing succession, Mackenzie Mountains, Northwest Territories, Canada provide insights to the paleoenvironmental conditions. Based on sedimentological and petrographic analyses of a 6-m vertical section of the vertebrate-bearing strata, three depositional scenarios for the MOTH locality are proposed, the favoured interpretation being that the vertebrate-bearing interval was deposited on the outer margin of a carbonate platform within an intra-shelf topographic low below storm-wave base. This interpretation is supported by the presence of fine, alternating laminae of light grey argillaceous limestone, or calcareous shale, and dark grey silt to sand-rich calcareous shale, as observed in thin section, and the characterization of the lithology for the vertebrate-bearing strata as an interlaminated argillaceous limestone and calcareous shale. An abundant, low-diversity association of cryptic trace fossils, previously unrecognized at MOTH, is described. These trace fossils and the presence of pyrite suggest that the intra-shelf topographic sag at MOTH had restricted circulation and was generally hypoxic. Based on the instability of such a restricted environment, a cause of death for the cyathaspids Dinaspidella and Nahanniaspis is unclear. However, turbidite deposition and seasonal turnover can be eliminated as possible causes of death, as vertebrates were not located frequently enough within light or dark grey layers and minimal signs of skeletal abrasion or fracturing were observed in Dinaspidella and Nahanniaspis. The high preservation potential of the fossils at MOTH likely was enhanced by the hypoxic nature of the bottom waters within the intra-shelf topographic low below storm-wave base.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) availability has generally been assumed to be the limiting or co-limiting factor for plant growth in alpine environments. To test this assumption, the biogeochemistiy of phosphorus (P) along an alpine topographic/snow gradient located on Niwot Ridge, Colorado Front Range was studied in the context of P limitation for plant growth. We measured the various P pools using a selective extraction procedure, determined sorption parameters, and quantified P availability indices. The topographic/snow gradient at Niwot Ridge is divided by the aspect and slope position in relation to the dominant westerly winds into leeward-sloping, windward-sloping and generally level sites. Our study found that the snow-melting gradient along the alpine transect greatly affected the antecedent soil moisture, which in turn, controlled the spatial pattern of the major soil attributes such as texture, OC, weathering index, bulk density, non-labile and labile P pools and P availability. The level sites exhibited the highest concentration of organically bound P (1056 +/- 75 mg/kg), labile P (315 +/- 32 mg/kg), and P in soil solutions corrected for soil adsorption capacity (field condition, 4.9 +/- 4.1 mg/l and saturated paste, 8.0 +/- 7.5 mg/l). Results of correlation analysis between the various P pools and aboveground biomass of different plant groups suggests that a high level of available P provides a growing advantage to only certain alpine plants and is not a good indicator of the spatial distribution of total aboveground biomass.

AB  - Two experiments were carried out in the laboratory to evaluate the effect of formulation of the nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) of the velvetbean caterpillar, Anticarsia gemmatalis Hubner (AgNPV). oil the predator Podisus nigrispinus Dallas. In the first experiment, predators were exclusively fed A, gemmatalis reared oil artificial diet, treated with one formulation of the AgNPV (infected prey) or with water (healthy prey) its the control. lit the second experiment, an additional treatment was incorporated in which the artificial diet wits treated with all inactive (autoclaved) AgNPV form illation. The predators were fed on these exclusive prey during their entire lifespans for three or four consecutive generations, during the first and second experiment, respectively. Daily observation of oviposition and mortality were performed to provide data for the construction of fertility life tables and to determine daily oviposition patterns and survival distribution curves. For both experiments, no adverse effects were observed in the first generation, However, significant effects in the predator population were observed throughout the subsequent generations, when the predators were fed with prep that fed oil infective or inactivated AgNPV diet compared with the healthy prep. The adverse effects observed might be duc to sonic inert components present in the commercial formulation, because the AgNPV has been demonstrated to be highly specific to Lepidoptera and neither does it replicate nor has any adverse effect oil P. nigrispinus, The fertility life tables proved to be a good tool to measure the potential impact of biopesticides oil nontarget population under laboratory conditions.

AB  - Free-living nematode distribution, abundance, diversity, and biological traits at Lake Bacalar were evaluated to assess the environmental quality of the water body. Using an Ekman grab, triplicate sediment samples were collected at 15 sampling sites. Nematodes were identified at family and genus levels, while abundance and diversity indices were calculated. Additionally, functional traits were calculated, and a PCA analysis was applied. The nematode fauna was represented by 6 orders, 18 families and 29 genera. Chromadorida had the highest number of taxa (9 genera), followed by Monhysterida (7 genera) and Enoplida (7 genera). Genera richness was higher at coarse sediments, with Simpson index values ranging 3.96-4.60, which were consistent with the Shannon index (H ' > 3 bits. ind(-1)). The maturity index varied from 2.5 to 3.1, with a higher percentage of cp-3-5 nematodes (> 55%). Multivariate analysis showed three nematode groups, one associated with chlorophyll a, pH, salinity, and silicates, the second group with dissolved oxygen, and organic matter, and a third group related with nutrient content in water. Biological traits showed a dominance of deposit feeders (37%) and epistrate feeders (35%). Nematode body shape was represented by slender (39%), medium plump (31%), while conical tails were dominant (68%) and the body length varied from < 500 to 3000 mu m, with dominance of lengths > 500-750 (46%) and > 750-1250 (38%), organisms typical of oligotrophic lakes. Nematode assemblages, water chemical characteristics, mainly nutrient concentrations, and biological traits confirm the oligotrophic conditions at Lake Bacalar.

AB  - Most of the world's large river ecosystems are subject to multiple anthropogenic stressors including climate change, disconnection between the main river channel and floodplain, flow regulation, and land-use modification. Viewed through a resilience lens, these ecosystems are potentially in a new regime, exhibiting a different structure, function, and set of feedbacks. We investigated the trophic status and food web character response to anthropogenic stressors over 150 years in the Illinois River. Differences in stable isotope ratios, community niche space, basal resource contribution to higher levels in the food web, mean trophic position of fish functional feeding guilds, and food chain length among four stressor phases suggest changes in ecosystem function in the Illinois River. Moreover, the river did not return to pre-stressor conditions following watershed-wide restoration efforts. Differences in trophic status and food web character also varied between the upper- and lower-river zones of the Illinois River over time. This spatial divergence further highlights the complexity of responses to multiple stressors in this ecosystem. Overall, differences in trophic status and food web character suggest a shift to a new regime-an Anthropocene regime-and one that has a reduced capacity to absorb additional disturbances. Given human pressures are a global issue, our results based on a 150 years data set, could assist in the management of riverine landscapes that face regime shifts due to human stressors.

AB  - In this paper, I aim to convey the history of ecopsychology's changing conceptualizations of science and technology and their role in facilitating engagement with the ecology movement. To do so, I compare ecopsychology's treatment of science and technology in two important publications: Gatherings, a non-peer-reviewed digital journal of the early 2000s that portrayed ecopsychology in humanistic, socially critical, and artistic terms; and Ecopsychology, a scholarly journal founded in 2009 that regarded ecopsychological questions as testable hypotheses, and distinguished itself from prior ("first generation") ecopsychology on the basis of its embrace of technological progress and the scientific method. As a part of this shift, ecopsychologists of the "second generation" championed the notion that humans are a "Technological Species," an ontological statement that naturalized the increasing sophistication of high technology as the result of inherent human drives, and established conceptual groundwork for studies that used consumer technology such as computers to mediate experiences of nature. In the final part of the paper, I critique the "Technological Species" proposition for obscuring the historical and material conditions that make the existence of consumer technology possible, such as the ecologically devastating mining of rare-earth metals on colonized land in Central and South America. I argue that, to be socially and ecologically accountable, ecopsychology should turn toward practices that help us make sense of consumer technology's place in systems of colonialist and ecological violence, process our place within these systems as users of consumer technology, and build community less dependent on technology.

AB  - The multinomial ecological indicator values (EIV) categorize species according to their ecological optima. They are a widely used expert system in ecology and vegetation science, their biological causes are largely unknown. The root anatomy of Carex shows considerable quantitative and qualitative differences. It is hypothesized that root traits may be responsible for the niche differentiation of the species, which means they predict the ecological optima of Carex species in terms of the EIV. This relationship was tested for the 107 German Carex species over ecological gradients of soil moisture, nutrients, soil reaction, temperature and light. Generalized estimating equations were used to model the multinomial indicator values by six anatomical traits: radius of root and central cylinder (stele), sclerenchyma thickness, aerenchyma width, largest vessel diameter and vessel number. Sclerenchyma thickness and endoderm radius predict soil moisture optima; the endoderm radius also light optima. Species of dry soils have thicker sclerenchyma and a wider stele. Species of shady growth conditions have wider steles. The diameter of the largest vessel was positively related to soil nitrogen, species of nitrogen-rich soils possess wider vessels. The width of the aerenchyma was positively but marginally significant related to increasing soil moisture. Root anatomy predicts the ecological optima of species along several ecological gradients and may thus explain the ecological differentiation of the species. This hitherto unknown pattern could probably only be observed due to the extraordinary diversity of Carex, which occupy widely different habitats within a region.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to understand the distribution of the empirical evidence that intends rural and urban ways of life in relation to the use of waters and territorial identities in the Metropolitan Region of Salvador (MRS), Bahia, Brazil. A methodology based on the identification of territorial tensions, observed from 2005 to 2015, regarding the dispute over water use in the MRS, called Qualitative Indicators of Water Use Tension (QIWT). The use of QIWT allowed the identification of evidences and categorization of tensions in the use of water in the MRS, that is, interpretative and analytical methodological categories of empirical events in order to assign them phenomenon content and from then on to typify them. There was a predominance of tension by the appropriation of water (T-1), especially in the areas of greater demand for water for urban-industrial uses. The tension of the uses of water in cultural activities (T-3), the least frequent, confirmed the permanence counter-hegemonic the rural in the metropolitan space and revealed a clear potential for human development and nature conservation, because such uses demand good environmental conditions of the springs and sources of water supply. The application of the QIWT revealed a dimension of social reality, which emerged from the notions of rural and metropolitan rurality in its relationship with the use of water, ignored in the public policies of the MRS, whose environmental issue could be re-signified in the space of the metropolis as rural-urban.

AB  - Soil is an important natural resource, a medium for plant growth, and its quality is decisive for sustainable crop productivity. Soil biological properties in evergreen and deciduous fruit crops were estimated under subtropical region of north-west India; wherein, samples were taken from 0-20 to 0-40 cm soil layers. In the present study, total soil organic carbon (TSOC) and carbon (C) pools, viz., very labile (C-VL), labile (C-L), less labile (C-LL), non-labile (C-NL) and biological properties were determined in fruit crops. The results revealed that TSOC, C pools and soil enzymes activities were significantly higher in fruit crops as compared to control (uncultivated). The uncultivated soils (1.96 g kg(-1)) had the lowest TSOC content, which was lower (p 0.05) than evergreen (3.19-4.69 g kg(-1)) and deciduous (2.99-5.68 g kg(-1)) fruit crops. Soil biological properties (microbial biomass carbon, basal soil respiration and quotients) were significantly higher in the fruit crops than the uncultivated, which has increased the C mineralization in soil. Principal component analysis identified C-L in PC1 (explaining 52.2% of total variability), microbial quotients in PC2 (25.7% variability) and soil pH in PC3 (10.3% variability) as the most dominant and reliable indicators for the assessment of soil quality in fruit crops. In general, evergreen crops showed higher soil biological activities than deciduous fruit crops. The result signifies that the evergreen fruit crops substantially influenced C sequestration than deciduous fruit crops, which consequential mitigate the negative impacts of climate change.

AB  - The application of invasive fish Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio Bloch, 1782) as bioindicator organism, using intestine as bioindicator tissue of anthropogenic influence in the lowland Ilova River was estimated. Intestinal tissue enables the investigation of dietborne metal uptake, so the first record on intestinal metal levels in Prussian carp was presented, as total and cytosolic fraction, which indicates the proportions of potentially toxic and bioavailable metals. Pollution impact was also estimated by analyses of biomarkers of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde), antioxidative capacity (catalase and glutathione) and of metal exposure (metallothioneins). All analyzed parameters were compared in the intestine of fish from the reference site and contaminated site impacted by technological and municipal wastewaters in two seasons. Both total and cytosolic As, Ca, Cd, Cs, Cu, Mg, Na and Rb levels were significantly higher at contaminated than the reference site in at least one season, whereas Mn and V had higher concentrations at the reference site. Despite differences in concentrations, average proportions of total metal levels in cytosolic fraction were comparable at two sites, i.e. over 70% for Na, K, Rb, Se, Cd, Cs, As and Mo, indicating their high possibility of binding to important biomolecules. In addition, higher levels of malondialdehyde in both seasons and enhanced catalase activity in spring, indicated disturbed environmental conditions near the contaminated site and need of continuous monitoring of this region. Finally, our research represents successful application of widely distributed invasive species in ecotoxicological studies, whereas intestine was shown as a suitable bioindicator tissue, clearly reflecting dietary metal uptake.

AB  - The article considers the important problem of technical and economic optimization of the operating modes of the first rise section of water supply systems. At the same time, the task is to minimize the costs associated with the excessive operation of pumps, while providing the protection of the pipeline from freezing in harsh natural operating conditions. To solve this problem, a computer simulation model was developed for the first rise section, equipped with a pump performance control system. The main differences of the developed model are: integrated approach to the analysis of parameters of various physical nature, assessment of the object economic indicators, possibility of simulating non-standard control algorithms. Preliminary studies of the model have shown the possibility and feasibility of its application for calculating the optimal parameters and operating modes of the object under consideration. Based on the simulation results, it was revealed that to calculate the control action by level, it is advisable to use the PID law, for temperature-PD law, for flow rate-PI law. To calculate the main control action, it is proposed to simultaneously calculate the actions in terms of level and temperature, followed by bringing the larger of them to the value of the setpoint for the flow rate maintained by the flow controller. The studies of the proposed management concept for the first rise section have shown its high technical and economic efficiency. In particular, the savings in electricity consumption are estimated at about 55.2% while providing pipeline frost protection.

AB  - Fuels from renewable biological resources are currently being used as an alternative or complement to petroleum-derived fossil fuels. The objective of this work was to investigate the degradation dynamics of commercially-available biodiesel blends (containing 1, 5 or 16% biodiesel, i.e. B1, B5 and B16) in soil simultaneously polluted with metals and biodiesel blends. To this purpose, soil was artificially polluted with 6,000 mg biodiesel blend per kg DW soil (B1, B5 or B16) and a mixture of metals: 1,500 mg Zn kg(- 1) DW soil + 500 mg Cu kg(-1) DW soil + 50 mg Cd kg(-1) DW soil. Artificially-polluted soils were then arranged in a phytotron under controlled conditions and monitored for 30 days. The bioremediation capacity of a bio-stabilized municipal solid waste, as organic amendment for biostimulation purposes, was evaluated. Soil health was monitored by measuring soil microbial indicators (biomass, activity and diversity parameters) and performing phytotoxicity bioassays with Cucumis sativus. The degradation of the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) present in biodiesel was higher than that of the corresponding alkane homologues from diesel. The addition of the bio-stabilized municipal solid waste increased FAME degradation and microbial activity, and alleviated phytotoxicity. Cucumis sativus was more sensitive to pollution-induced effects than soil microbial communities. Our data showed that, after 30 days, organically-amended soils polluted with B16 experienced the greatest improvement in soil health (in the presence of the abovementioned metal mixture). It was concluded that biodiesel-containing fuel might cause a lower impact on soil health than diesel of fossil origin.

AB  - The present study aims to characterize and evaluate the sustainability of two agricultural systems of the Ejido Cubiri de la Capilla, Sinaloa municipality, one technified and the other traditional, through the Framework for the Evaluation of Natural Resource Management Systems incorporating Sustainability Indicators (MESMIS). In this sense, this study seeks to support national evaluation systems on how to integrate evaluations to the review of the bases and foundations of long-term sustainable development based on the SDGs of the 2030 Agenda of the three dimensions of sustainable development: social, economic and environmental. In this research, three areas were evaluated, social, economic and environmental, from which 44 indicators emerged in total. In the analysis of the information, it was found that the indicators of the environmental and economic dimension turned out to be more sustainable than those of the sociocultural dimension. In general, for the traditional agroecosystem, practices that tend towards sustainability have been applied in the production system, but it may be at risk due to the high cost of labor due to the demand for workers, inputs and equipment and tools. Regarding the socio-cultural sphere, it was found that in neither of the two systems evaluated is there a participation of women in decision-making, however in the environmental dimension, the producers actively participate in the protection of the water resource, for which they carry out cleaning and protection of water source structures, however, a sustainable system of soil conservation practices has yet to be implemented. The multi-criteria sustainability indicators used in this study demonstrated their validity and adaptation to the environment; they are simple, reliable and replicable, therefore their use in similar conditions is recommended.

AB  - Extreme climate events have been identified both in meteorological and long-term proxy records from the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) realm. However, the potential of palaeoclimate data for understanding mechanisms triggering climate extremes over long time scales has not been fully exploited. A distinction between proxies indicating climate change, environment, and ecosystem shift is crucial for enabling a comparison with forcing mechanisms (e.g. El-Nino Southern Oscillation). In this study we decouple these factors using data analysis techniques [multiplex recurrence network (MRN) and principal component analyses (PCA)] on multiproxy data from two lakes located in different climate regions - Lonar Lake (ISM dominated) and the high-altitude Tso Moriri Lake (ISM and westerlies influenced). Our results indicate that (i) MRN analysis, an indicator of changing environmental conditions, is associated with droughts in regions with a single climate driver but provides ambiguous results in regions with multiple climate/environmental drivers; (ii) the lacustrine ecosystem was 'less sensitive' to forcings during the early Holocene wetter periods; (iii) archives in climate zones with a single climate driver were most sensitive to regime shifts; (iv) data analyses are successful in identifying the timing of onset of climate change, and distinguishing between extrinsic and intrinsic (lacustrine) regime shifts by comparison with forcing mechanisms. Our results enable development of conceptual models to explain links between forcings and regional climate change that can be tested in climate models to provide an improved understanding of the ISM dynamics and their impact on ecosystems.

AB  - Land abandonment, e.g. agricultural land abandonment, can result in various social and ecological impacts. It would thus be helpful if the extent and spatial pattern of future land abandonment could be projected. However, the trajectory of future land abandonment generally depends on various factors, including biophysical conditions and future changes in socioeconomic indicators in the area. In this study, we developed a general framework for a scenario-based land abandonment projection, featuring a coupled regional economic and spatially explicit land change modeling approach. We applied this framework in selected municipalities in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, under two socioeconomic development scenarios (2014-2050): low population and economic growth (LL scenario) and high population and economic growth (HH scenario). The case study results, which are also visualized through a set of hot spot maps, revealed that agricultural land abandonment would be more intense under the HH scenario due to the much higher future decline in farmer population driven by the shift in people's employment and main source of livelihood. Under the LL scenario, residential and urban land abandonment would be more profound because of the much higher future decline in total population. In general, our results provide insights into some plausible future socioeconomic changes, their interplay and their consequent land abandonment in the case study Scenario analysis area, which would be useful in the context of forward-looking adaptive development planning. The pro- posed framework can be applied to other case study areas. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Data on the contents of particulate organic matter (POM) in the humus horizons of different soil types were obtained. The influence of the land use system and fertilizers on the carbon of particulate organic matter (C-POM) in gray forest soil and typical chernozem was shown. The mineralization rate of POM under constant conditions of temperature and moisture was estimated, and the ratios between the pools of POM and biologically active organic matter in the soils were calculated. In the soils of natural cenoses, the percentage of POM together with the sand particle-size fraction varied within 12-36% of the soil mass, and the C-POM content varied from 1.66 to 8.03% of the fraction mass. The portion of C-POM in the total C-org ranged from 20 to 48%. Cultivated gray forest soil and typical chernozem were depleted of C-POM by 3.0-3.2 and 2.0-2.8 times, respectively, in comparison with the samples of noncultivated soils. The mineralization rate of POM in the gray forest soil and typical chernozem was about the same (7.9-12.1 and 7.2-8.2% of C-POM, respectively), which was about 1.2-2.4 times higher than the mineralization rate of the total soil organic matter. It was noted that POM could be a sensitive indicator of the C-org dynamics in the soil, a good predictor of changes in the content and quality of soil organic matter, and a significant source of potentially mineralizable organic matter in the soil.

AB  - The surface water quality highly depends on the natural conditions and on the industrial, agricultural and other anthropogenic activities in the river catchment areas. The quality of the surface water is the key factor in the water quality management. The monitoring of the water quality indicators is requested to follow up (in time and space) the changes in the water quality, providing healthy water for the people. The water quality indicators (physical-chemical specific parameters such as: pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity etc.) provide information about the pollution degree of different waters (stemming from wastewater treatment plants, precipitation, sewer lines, tributaries, etc.).
   The main aim of the research was to demonstrate the efficiency of artificial intelligence techniques for the water quality prediction. Consequently, the considered system was modelled using a neuro-evolutive technique, combining artificial neural networks (ANN) with differential evolution (DE) algorithm. The neural network acts as a system model, while the differential evolution algorithm is the optimizer with the function to determine the optimal parameters of the model. The simulation results pointed out that the approach is suitable to set up adequate models for the three parameters, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, respectively. For the fourth parameter (turbidity), an average absolute error of 30% was obtained, which indicates a more complex relation in rapport to the other parameters of the system.
   The DE-ANN approach can, thus, be further used in decision making solutions for water quality management. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation allows for vegetative species to be used as indicators of environmental pollution by heavy metals. Considering the distribution of Prosopis laevigata (mesquite) and Schinus molle (pepper tree) heavy metal concentrations were determined as potential indicators of environmental impact assessment for agricultural and livestock, rural settlement, commercial and service, urban settlement and mining land uses. A total of 30 sampling points were established during summer, autumn, winter and spring, based on the presence of the two species. Applying the technique of ICP- MS, concentrations of Al, As, Co, Cu, Cd, Pb, Ti, V and Zn were determined. With a statistic model the interactions between species, type of land use and season with respect to the concentration of these minerals in the leaf material were determined. Results indicated that the presence of heavy metals is determined by the effect of the species, land use and season, and the possible association between these. The specie of mesquite was the most efficient for bioaccumulation of Pb, Co and Al. In the same way, the pepper tree was more efficient with respect to Ti. On one hand, trees located in the mining land use showed the highest concentrations of Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Co and As. On the other hand, the spring season presented the highest concentration of Cu, Zn, Co, Ti and V. With that, it could be demonstrated that As, Co, Cd, Pb, Ti and Zn concentrations were above the normal limit. Therefore, the dynamics and functionality, environmental factors and physiological differences to develop physicalchemical processes in the absorption and transport of these elements towards the leaves are a determining factor of vegetative species placed under conditions of fragmentation, are good elements for surveying on pollution and environmental impact.

AB  - In order to develop a rapid assay suitable for algal eco-toxicity assessments under conditions representative of natural ecosystems, this study evaluated the short-term (< 1 h) response of algae exposed to atrazine and DCMU using oxygen productivity measurements. When Chlorella vulgaris was exposed to these herbicides under 'standard' low light intensity (as prescribed by OECD201 guideline), the 20 min-EC50 values recorded via oxygen productivity (atrazine: 1.32 +/- 0.07 mu M; DCMU: 0.31 +/- 0.005 mu M) were similar the 96-h EC50 recorded via algal growth (atrazine: 0.56 mu M; DCMU: 0.41 mu M), and within the range of values reported in the literature. 20 min-EC50 values increased by factors of 3.0 and 2.1 for atrazine and DCMU, respectively, when light intensity increased from 60 to 1400 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) of photosynthetically active radiation, or PAR. Further investigation showed that exposure time significantly also impacted the sensitivity of C. vulgaris under high light intensity (> 840 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) as PAR) as the EC50 for atrazine and DCMU decreased by up to 6.2 and 2.1 folds, respectively, after 50 min of exposure at a light irradiance of 1400 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) as PAR. This decrease was particularly marked at high light intensities and low algae concentrations and is explained by the herbicide disruption of the electron transfer chain triggering photo-inhibition at high light intensities. Eco-toxicity assessments aiming to understand the potential impact of toxic compounds on natural ecosystems should therefore be performed over sufficient exposure times (> 20 min for C. vulgaris) and under light intensities relevant to these ecosystems.

AB  - In this paper, we demonstrate the ability of Arabidopsis thaliana to detect different mixtures of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by the common indoor fungus, Aspergillus versicolor, and demonstrate the potential usage of the plant as a bioindicator to monitor fungal VOCs in indoor air. We evaluated the volatile production of Aspergillus versicolor strains SRRC 108 (NRRL 3449) and SRRC 2559 (ATCC 32662) grown on nutrient rich fungal medium, and grown under conditions to mimic the substrate encountered in the built environment where fungi would typically grow indoors (moist wallboard and ceiling tiles). Using headspace solid phase microextraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, we analyzed VOC profiles of the two strains. The most abundant compound produced by both strains on all three media was 1-octen-3-ol. Strain SRRC 2559 made several terpenes not detected from strain SRRC 108. Using a split-plate bioassay, we grew Arabidopsis thaliana in a shared atmosphere with VOCs from the two strains of Aspergillus versicolor grown on yeast extract sucrose medium. The VOCs emitted by SRRC 2559 had an adverse impact on seed germination and plant growth. Chemical standards of individual VOCs from the Aspergillus versicolor mixture (2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 1-octen-3-ol, limonene, and beta-farnesene), and beta-caryophyllene were tested one by one in seed germination and vegetative plant growth assays. The most inhibitory compound to both seed germination and plant growth was 1-octen-3-ol. Our data suggest that Arabidopsis is a useful model for monitoring indoor air quality as it is sensitive to naturally emitted fungal volatile mixtures as well as to chemical standards of individual compounds, and it exhibits relatively quick concentration-and duration-dependent responses.

AB  - To examine N-isotope ratios (N-15/N-14) in tissues and shell organic matrix of bivalves as a proxy for natural and anthropogenic nutrient fluxes in coastal environments, Pinctada imbricata, Isognomon alatus, and Brachidontes exustus bivalves were live-collected and analyzed from eight sites in Bocas del Toro, Panama. Sites represent a variety of coastal environments, including more urbanized, uninhabited, riverine, and oceanic sites. Growth under differing environmental conditions is confirmed by delta O-18 values, with open ocean Escudo de Veraguas shells yielding the highest average delta O-18 (-1.0 parts per thousand) value and freshwater endmember Rio Guarumo the lowest (-1.7 parts per thousand). At all sites there is no single dominant source of organic matter contributing to bivalve delta N-15 and delta C-13 values. Bivalve delta N-15 and delta C-13 values likely represent a mixture of mangrove and seagrass N and C, although terrestrial sources cannot be ruled out. Despite hydrographic differences between end-members, we see minimal delta N-15 and delta C-13 difference between bivalves from the river-influenced Rio Guarumo site and those from the oceanic Escudo de Veraguas site, with no evidence for N from open-ocean phytoplankton in the latter. Populated sites yield relative N-15 enrichments suggestive of anthropogenic nutrient input, but low delta N-15 values overall make this interpretation equivocal. Lastly, delta N-15 values of tissue and shell organic matrix correlate significantly for pterioideans P. imbricata and I. alatus. Thus for these species, N isotope studies of historical and fossil shells should provide records of ecology of past environments.

AB  - Background
   Loss of biodiversity and increased nutrient inputs are two of the most crucial anthropogenic factors driving ecosystem change. Although both received considerable attention in previous studies, information on their interactive effects on ecosystem functioning is scarce. In particular, little is known on how soil biota and their functions are affected by combined changes in plant diversity and fertilization.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   We investigated the effects of plant diversity, functional community composition, and fertilization on the biomass and respiration of soil microbial communities in a long-term biodiversity experiment in semi-natural grassland (Jena Experiment). Plant species richness enhanced microbial basal respiration and microbial biomass, but did not significantly affect microbial specific respiration. In contrast, the presence of legumes and fertilization significantly decreased microbial specific respiration, without altering microbial biomass. The effect of legumes was superimposed by fertilization as indicated by a significant interaction between the presence of legumes and fertilization. Further, changes in microbial stoichiometry (C-to-N ratio) and specific respiration suggest the presence of legumes to reduce N limitation of soil microorganisms and to modify microbial C use efficiency.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Our study highlights the role of plant species and functional group diversity as well as interactions between plant community composition and fertilizer application for soil microbial functions. Our results suggest soil microbial stoichiometry to be a powerful indicator of microbial functioning under N limited conditions. Although our results support the notion that plant diversity and fertilizer application independently affect microbial functioning, legume effects on microbial N limitation were superimposed by fertilization, indicating significant interactions between the functional composition of plant communities and nutrient inputs for soil processes.

AB  - Bryozoans exhibit a highly variable chemistry within their calcium carbonate skeletons. Previous studies have shown that the level of Mg-calcite in skeletons increases with increasing seawater temperature. For high-latitude regions such as the Antarctic, which have a low range of annual sea-temperature variation, there have been no studies on bryozoan skeletons with replicated sampling approaches suitable for statistical testing. Our aim was to conduct high-replicate, multi-site sampling to determine the variability in skeletal mineralogy of bryozoans from a site in Antarctica. During an expedition in January 2012, a total of 584 specimens representing 4 bryozoan species were collected from 8 sites at Adelaide Island, West Antarctic Peninsula, by SCUBA diving. All specimens were sampled within a 3 wk period and were selected to be of similar size, age and breeding status. We compared the variability in the wt% MgCO3 in calcite of skeletons among species and investigated the relative influence of environmental and biological factors on skeleton chemistry. The results of X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the wt% MgCO3 in calcite in bryozoan skeletons was statistically different among sites for all study species. The difference in wt% MgCO3 among sites may be explained by habitat fragmentation driving directional adaptation of isolated populations to local environmental conditions. The relationship between Mg-calcite and temperature was inconsistent among species, and the predicted positive correlation between seawater temperature and Mg-calcite was not exhibited in any of the species examined. On this basis, we suggest that Antarctic bryozoan Mg-calcite should not be considered a reliable indicator of paleo-temperature.

AB  - Durability is one of the most significant aspects of the behaviours of natural stone in the real environment. As it is not a fundamental property, it cannot be measured in situ or by using any simple laboratory test. Therefore, durability is assessed by using several approaches such as (1) accelerated laboratory durability tests (freeze-thaw cycling, wetting-drying, salt crystallization resistance), (2) complex environmental testing in test cabinets, and (3) exposure site testing. In this review paper, the advantages and drawbacks of these approaches are discussed and compared with other approaches such as practical experience and/or indirect assessments of selected physical properties, which have been found empirically to have a strong influence upon the durability of materials. Based on current information, accelerated laboratory durability tests (although the most widespread type of tests) exhibit serious limitations in terms of oversimplified test methods. Complex environmental testing provides more reliable results, but is less accessible for common testing owing to experiments' long duration and high operational costs. Similar drawbacks are applicable for in situ testing. Practical experience combines the value of the material's exposure in real-life conditions and the duration of interactions; but it is highly impractical when the sampling of experimental materials is required. Extrapolation of the durability of natural stone from the results of some common laboratory tests (porosimetry approach for complex evaluation of pore space; mechanical properties under various degrees of saturation; response of a natural stone exposed to water (i.e. swelling behaviour)) seems to be an appropriate alternative to previous approaches.

AB  - The susceptibility assessment of natural enemies to pesticides is relevant before the use of selective pesticides and biological control agents within the framework of integrated pest management programs. Chrysoperla externa (Hagen) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) is a predator considered a potential biocontrol agent of agricultural pests in the Neothropical Region. The aim of this study was to evaluate the short and long-term effects of two broad spectrum insecticides (cypermethrin and endosulfan) and two biorational (spinosad and methoxyfenozide) registered in Argentina on young C. externa adults under laboratory conditions by ingestion through drinking water. The assessed end-points were: survivorship during preoviposition period, preoviposition time, fecundity and fertility of females, and survivorship of the progeny. Total survivorship of adults was adversely affected only by cypermethrin that reduced the survivorship of adults irrespective of sex. Although endosulfan did not induce significant total mortality, it reduced the survivorship of females. All tested insecticides delayed the reproductive maturity of adults. Cypermethrin, endosulfan, and spinosad reduced the fecundity of females. Fertility was affected only by spinosad. Methoxyfenozide was the insecticide inducing the lowest effects on reproductive parameters. No effects were observed on the survival of progeny with any of the tested compounds. In accordance with the International Organization for Biological Control and Noxious Animals and Plants guidelines the insecticides were classified according to its lethal effects in the following toxicity classes: methoxyfenozide, spinosad, and endosulfan, class 1 (innocuous); cypermethrin, class 2 (moderately toxic). However, if sublethal effects are taken into account, spinosad and endosulfan should not be considered innocuous.

AB  - It has been suggested that above and belowground interactions produce important feedbacks in natural ecosystems. It is necessary to study the relationships between aboveground plant functional group traits and belowground biomass and soil chemical properties in natural grasslands.
   In a field study, four natural alpine meadows dominated by different plant functional groups were selected. We assigned the plant species to one of two functional groups: the grasses functional group (GFG) or the forbs functional group (FFG). The aboveground GFG and FFG biomass and total belowground biomass were measured. At the same time, for each sampling quadrat, soil pH, soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available nitrogen (AN), total phosphorus (TP), and available phosphorus (AP) were determined.
   GFG-dominated meadows had significantly higher total belowground biomass, SOM, TN, TP, AN, and AP than FFG-dominated meadows. Correlation analyses showed that total belowground biomass (to a depth of 30 cm) and soil nutrient contents were significantly and positively correlated with the GFG biomass proportion, but negatively correlated with the FFG biomass proportion.
   There were significant positive correlations among above and belowground biomass and the soil chemical properties studied. The GFG proportion may thus be an indicator of soil chemical properties in the studied meadow types. This implies that natural increases in, or introduction of more, GFG species in FFG-dominated meadows may improve soil nutrient conditions. This study provides the basis of understanding for future studies on plant-soil interactions and feedbacks in grassland ecosystems.

AB  - Continuous plankton recorders (CPRs) have been used in the Northwest Atlantic for almost 50 years. While data collected by these surveys have provided valuable information on long-term variability in plankton populations, all previous analyses have been limited to only a portion of the geographic range of the available data. Here we present an analysis of the CPR data from the Mid Atlantic Bight to the Labrador Sea. Across this wide geographic range, we found many common associations among the taxa. In particular, the changes in most regions were strongly size structured, with small and medium copepods varying together and often positively related to indicators of phytoplankton abundance. The time series from nearby regions were strongly correlated; however, after 1990, the spatial pattern became more complex. During this period, several of the copepod taxa, noticeably Calanus finmarchicus and Centropages typicus, experienced a series of anomalies that appeared to propagate from northeast to southwest. Although the direction of propagation was consistent with the shelf circulation, the anomalies propagated at a rate much slower than typical current speeds. The timing of the copepod anomalies and their phase speed were similar in character to observed changes in salinity and the position of the Shelf Slope Front. The correspondence between the changes in the plankton community and changes in the physical environmental suggests that physical conditions are a strong driver of interannual variability in Northwest Atlantic Shelf ecosystems.

AB  - Exergy, as the sum of energy and information contained in a given system due to living organisms, can act as a quality indicator of ecosystems. Here, we investigated the exergy of Marsala Lagoon (Mediterranean Sea), along with microbial (prokaryotic and heterotrophic nanobenthos) biomass, prokaryotic heterotrophic production and extracellular enzymatic activities, and the biochemical composition of sediment organic matter. The aim of the study was to assess the role of auxiliary energy (e.g. hydrodynamic stress) in the ecosystem functioning and efficiency of a 'detritus sink' lagoon. Samples were collected at sites characterized by contrasting hydrodynamic and trophic conditions. Exergy transfer through the benthic microbial loop was influenced by two main factors: (1) organic matter bioavailability; and (2) hydrodynamic forcing. At both sites, the values of total exergy were higher in summer than in winter, and the specific exergy decreased from winter to autumn, along with increasing auxiliary energy. Our data indicate that in coastal 'detritus sink' systems, auxiliary energy sources can have a crucial role in exergy transfer and ecosystem functioning through modifying the efficiency of transfer to higher trophic levels of the refractory organic detritus, which is otherwise lost by burial in the sediment. As coastal lagoons are often intensively modified by human activities, we conclude that maintenance of the natural hydrodynamic regimes is a key factor in the preservation of the functioning of lagoon ecosystems and of their provision of goods and services to humans.

AB  - Whole-tree timber harvesting, which had taken place in 1988, caused massive erosion resulting in exposure of subsurface soil at Fort Benning, GA. Restoration efforts were begun in 1996 using land contouring and two vegetative treatments: (i) a seed mixture of weeping love grass, bahia grass, Bermudagrass, and sericea lespedeza (grass); and (ii) longleaf pine plus the seed mixture (grass + trees). Two additional conditions were included in this study: (iii) volunteer blackberry (berries) and (iv) areas bare of vegetation (bare). Control sites were longleaf pine communities ranging from 60 to 70 years. Specific objectives were (i) to evaluate the effect of vegetation on granular structure formation in subsoil material exposed by erosion and (ii) to evaluate the potential for aggregation to document degree of recovery. Aggregate size distribution was determined by sieving. Resieving after organic matter combustion and clay dispersal was done to determine primary aggregating agents. Granular aggregates at the soil surface of what was previously an E or Bt horizon formed in less than 10 years after the planting of reclamation vegetation. The mean ratio of aggregates bound by organic matter to the total amount of aggregates was greatest in the control (0.87), followed by remediation treatments (for grass, grass + trees, and berries, these were 0.61, 0.46, and 0.37, respectively), and least in the bare treatment (0.26). Remediation treatments, but not volunteer blackberry establishment, significantly enhanced recovery of A-horizon structure relative to bare. Results reflect a shift from blocky or no structure to granular structure in response to remediation. The ratio of organically bound to inorganically bound aggregation is a promising indicator to document recovery of more natural soil surface structure after disturbance.

AB  - Sciomyzid flies, which have potential as bio-indicators, were sampled by sweep-net surveys at a turlough in the west of Ireland. Turloughs are ephemeral wetlands (unique to Ireland), which flood from groundwater in winter and empty in the summer, during that time, they are frequently grazed. The weekly survey consisted of ten linear sweeps (5 m x 1 m) in each of six homogeneous and contiguous vegetation zones throughout the summer of 2004. The fauna was dominated by univoltine species with Ilione albiseta being particularly abundant, though species displaying a range of phenologies and life histories were also present. Species richness and total abundance were significantly higher in the two zones with the highest hydroperiods. Mantel tests showed that the species matrix was significantly co-structured with permanent features of the physical environment, but not with stochastic sampling variables related to weather conditions. Mantel correllograms displayed typical patterns of autocorrelation for hydroperiod, soil moisture and soil pH in each zone and vegetation height, vegetation length and Ellenberg moisture index (weighted for vegetation composition) in each sweep-path. No patterns of autocorrelation were evident for distance among zones, area of patch of vegetation zone sampled, area of the vegetation zone on the whole turlough, soil mass-loss-on-ignition and Ellenberg N and reaction indices. These results provide strong evidence for high microhabitat specificity in Sciomyzidae at this site and indicate a major influence of vegetation structure and hydrological regime on their ecology.

AB  - With environmental factors being spatially structured, plant traits that are related to these factors should exhibit a corresponding spatial pattern. We analyzed the distribution pattern of seed mass in Germany. We calculated the median seed mass for 10' longitude by 6' latitude grid cells across Germany using the trait databases BIOLFLOR and the plant distribution database FLORKART. To explain these distribution patterns of median seed mass, we applied multiple regression analyses on twelve selected environmental variables, accounting for spatial autocorrelation. To deal with collinearities of the predictors, we used hierarchical partitioning to analyze the independent and joint explanatory power of the environmental variables. To test whether statistical relationships are due to hidden correlations between seed mass and plant growth form, we conducted seperate analyses for annual, perennial herbs, shrubs and trees. Low median seed mass was found in the lowlands and river valleys whereas high median seed mass was typical for the rich loess regions and the calcareous mountain ranges. Seed mass exhibited a strong positive correlation with soil pH (62% of variance explained) and a negative correlation with soil moisture (25%). Light was less important as a predictor of seed mass. Within the growth forms we observed similar distribution and correlation patterns pointing to a direct link between seed mass and the environmental variables soil pH and moisture. We argue that this striking relationship with soil pH is caused by the high stress from competition on fertile calcareous sites. The negative moisture effect may be due to drought stress. Both relationships are particulary interesting for the prediction of ecosystem responses to climate and land use changes.

AB  - Previous studies on environmental enrichment have generally placed a purported enrichment in the cage and observed changes in behavioural and physiological indicators of welfare. However, many of these 'enrichments' are not purposely designed, or appear to be designed with anthropomorphic or anthropocentric concerns, which have little biological relevance. The aim of this study was to screen the behavioural responses of mice to a range of 24 potential enrichments (PEs) considered by an expert panel to have characteristics most biologically relevant to mice. Female mice (64 C57/B1/6 and 64 ICR(CD-1)) were housed in groups of four and observed three days per week for 12 weeks whilst provided with a different PE weekly. The overall time-budgets of the two strains differed significantly. ICR(CD-1) mice performed more bar chewing, digging, manipulation of PEs, and rearing in the cage. They were also more likely to be hidden in the cage. C57/B1/6 mice performed more drinking, cage sniffing and social interaction, and showed three times more bar climbing. The two strains responded differently to the PEs, with the ICR(CD-1) mice making more use of PEs, particularly those that could be manipulated or which provided additional hiding places. The higher trait anxiety of the C57/B1/6 mice may have reduced their utilisation of novel PEs. We conclude that, whilst enrichment can significantly improve animal welfare, those types of enrichments that work well for all strains need to be identified, or strain-specific enrichment policies devised.

AB  - The environmental interpretation of the C-13/C-12 variations in the skeletons of massive corals is still a matter of debate. A 19-year seasonal skeletal C-13/C-12 record of a shallow-water Porites coral from the northern Red Sea (Gulf of Aqaba) documents interannual events of extraordinarily large plankton blooms, indicated by anomalous C-13 depletions in the coral skeleton. These blooms are caused by deep vertical water mass mixing, convectively driven in colder winters, which results in increased supplies of nutrients to the surface waters. The deep vertical mixings can sometimes be driven by the cooling occurring throughout the Middle East after large tropical volcanic eruptions. We therefore have evidence in our coral skeletal C-13/C-12 record for an indirect volcanic signal of the eruptions of El Chichon (1982) and Mount Pinatubo (1991). Deep mixing induced C-13/C-12 variations of the dissolved inorganic carbon in the surface waters can be neglected at this location. We therefore suggest that the C-13 skeletal depletions can be best explained by changes in the coral's autotrophy-heterotrophy diet, through increased heterotrophic feeding on zooplankton during the blooms. Increased feeding on C-13-depleted zooplankton or increased heterotrophy at the expense of autotrophy can both result in a C-13-depleted coral skeleton. However, this suggestion requires more testing. If our conclusions are substantiated, seasonal skeletal C-13/C-12 records of corals which change from autotrophy under normal conditions to increased heterotrophy during bloom events may be used as indicators of ocean paleoproductivity at interannual resolution, available from no other source.

AB  - The growth of a natural phytoplankton population was studied during a monospecific spring bloom of the diatom Rhizosolenia delicatula at Roscoff (western English Channel). Direct examination of the intracellular pool of 19 free amino acids (FAA) was used as an index of the physiological status of the cells. Total FAA in the particulate matter shows a general decrease during the bloom, and FAA cell content varies from 200 mM 1 cell volume-1 to 10 mM at the time of maximum biomass. FAA-N/particulate N is < 3% during the study, slightly decreasing at the time of maximum biomass. Individual free amino acids appear reliable for the development of the diatom biomass and good indicators of the growing population. At maximum biomass, major compounds are glutamic acid (30.8 mol%), glutamine (11.7%), alanine (9.9%), isoleucine (6.6%) and lysine (6.4%). Serine, glycine, arginine and aspartic acid appear also as major components during other periods of the study. We suggest that the observed changes are an indication of the physiological state of the cells during the bloom. In particular glutamine (GLN), glutamic acid (GLU) and the GLN/GLU ratio allow the metabolic evolution of the natural population to be characterized. GLN is strictly linked to the living biomass (Chla) while GLU is present at high percentage throughout the study. The ecological significance of beta-alanine (BALA) is also revealed during this study, being strongly correlated to degraded matter represented by phaeopigments. These results demonstrate the validity of using individual free amino acids as an aid in understanding the physiological status of algae in natural bloom conditions.

AB  - Sustainable multifunctional halochromic nanocomposite films ("smart films") were prepared using a casting method. Natural pigments (saffron or red barberry anthocyanins) and TiO2 nanoparticles were included in these films as pH-responsive color indicators and for light blocking, respectively, as well as for their other functional attributes. The film matrix was constructed from a network of crosslinked biopolymers consisting of gelatin and kappa-carrageenan. The mechanical, morphological, spectroscopic, colorimetric, thermal, barrier, ammonia sensitivity, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and biodegradable characteristics of the films were investigated. Moreover, the efficacy of the films was demonstrated by using them to monitor changes in the freshness of packaged fish during storage. Incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles and natural anthocyanins significantly improved the mechanical and moisture resistance of the films. Spectroscopic analysis (ATR-FTIR and XRD) indicated the nanoparticles and pigments were dispersed throughout the biopolymer matrix, and identified the important molecular interactions involved (such as hydrogen and electrostatic bonding). The films changed color in response to alterations in the freshness of the fish samples, which was correlated to ammonia production during fish degradation. The presence of the anthocyanins and TiO2 nanoparticles increased the bacteriostatic properties of the smart films, as well as inhibiting oxidative reactions. The smart films were shown to be biodegradable, decomposing within similar to 30 days under simulated environmental conditions. In conclusion, these biodegradable smart/active films may be suitable replacements for plastic packaging materials. Moreover, they are able to detect food deterioration and prolong shelf life, thereby improving quality and reducing waste.

AB  - Purpose Tailings are generally characterized by severe physicochemical conditions that limit the establishment of vegetation. The present study aimed to select suitable combinations of organo-mineral amendments to improve the physicochemical, biochemical, and biological properties of spolic technosols, highly contaminated with metals. Materials and methods Several substrates were prepared by mixing mine tailings (MT) of an abandoned mining area with non-contaminated agricultural soil (anthrosol), green waste compost, lime, and rock phosphate at different rates: S1 - 50% of MT + 50% of agricultural soil; S2 - S1 + 3% of lime (CaCO3); S3 - S1 + 6% of rock phosphate; S4 - S1 + 10% of compost; S5 - S1 + 10% of compost + 3% of lime; S6 - S1 + 10% of compost + 6% of rock phosphate. Untreated MT and agricultural soil were analyzed immediately, and 8 months after incorporating the amendments. Results and discussion Heterotrophic microorganisms were not recovered from untreated MT due to the highly acidic pH and available metal concentrations. However, the addition of organo-mineral amendments ameliorated the tailings' characteristics by increasing pH, conductivity, total organic carbon, and available P levels. Moreover, after 8 months, heterotrophic microorganisms were recovered from those substrates and dehydrogenase activity was enhanced. The incorporation of agricultural soil and green waste compost mixed either with lime (S5) or rock phosphate (S6) was the most effective treatment. Conclusions Both S5 and S6 mixtures successfully reduced the environmental risk posed by tailings, suggesting the potential use of these amendments for the remediation of pyrite mines.

AB  - The article provides original data on the ecological and geochemical characteristics of the distribution of Hg in the leaves and annual rings of balsam poplar (P. balsamifera L.) in the zone of influence of lithium production (Novosibirsk). In 2017 high Hg concentration (1300 ng/g) in the poplar leaves was recorded in the northeastern part of the city near the industrial facility of the lithium plant. The investigation showed a clear trend of increased Hg accumulation in the poplar leaves during the growing season. The maximum average Hg content was detected in the leaf litter in 2006 (1153-2425 ng/g). However, the average Hg content in the soil is 294 ng/ g, which is significantly lower than the threshold limit value (2100 ng/g). Studies of changes in the content of Hg with the height of the crown of the tree revealed an increase in the upwind side of the emission source, the concentration of Hg in the leaves is on average 1.5 times higher than on the side of the "wind shadow". Hg in poplar leaves, leaf litter, and soils is mainly found in free and physically bonded forms - the most mobile, prone to increased migration, transformation and methylation under environmental conditions. According to the Hg content in the poplar cores, an increase in the Hg input near the source was established with the beginning of Li production -in the period 1967-1985 years (441 ng/g) with a subsequent decrease to 6 ng/g in 2000-2017.

AB  - Capitella spp. is considered as an important ecological indicator of eutrophication due to its high densities in organic-rich, reduced, and sometimes polluted coastal ecosystems. We investigated whether such ability to cope with adverse ecological contexts might be a response to the microorganisms these worms are associated with. In populations from the French Atlantic coast (Roscoff, Brittany), we observed an epibiotic association covering the tegument of 20-30% specimens from an anthropized site while individuals from a reference, nonanthropized site were devoid of any visible epibionts. Using RNAseq, molecular and microscopic analyses, we described and compared the microbial communities associated with the epibiotic versus the non-epibiotic specimens at both locations. Interestingly, data showed that the epibiosis is characterized by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria among which the giant bacterium Thiomargarita sp., to date only described in deep sea habitats. Survey of Capitella combined with the geochemical analysis of their sediment revealed that epibiotic specimens are always found in muds with the highest concentration of sulfides, mostly during the summer. Concomitantly, tolerance tests demonstrated that the acquisition of epibionts increased survival against toxic level of sulfides. Overall, the present data highlight for the first time a peculiar plastic adaptation to seasonal variations of the habitat based on a transcient epibiosis allowing a coastal species to survive temporary harsher conditions.

AB  - The Portuguese millipede, Ommatoiulus moreleti (Lucas, 1860), is increasingly a pest of grains crops in Australian agricultural ecosystems. With the rapid uptake of minimum-tillage practices, habitat quality has been enhanced for several species of soil dwelling invertebrates, in particular O. moreleti.
   To understand the population dynamics of O. moreleti in Australian grains crops, populations were sampled at multiple sites for more than 2 years using pitfall traps and cardboard roll traps. Specimens were dissected to investigate reproductive status and developmental stage.
   Millipede trapping rates varied between sites and across the year, and tended to be lower when soil water content (m(3)/m(3)) was high. Both sexes were active year round, however females were relatively more abundant when ground temperatures were higher.
   Males in a copulatory state and females with mature eggs were collected year round although females lacking mature eggs were more common when ground temperatures were higher and the soil was drier, and female egg load was higher under cooler conditions. Females at a stadium 9 or later carried mature eggs and copulatory males tended to be from stadium 8 or later. Different developmental stages could be recovered at all times of the year.
   These findings indicate persistent populations of O. moreleti across fields throughout the year, with a key breeding period in autumn but likely opportunistic breeding all year. Control of millipedes will need to focus on increasing the impact of biological agents, decreasing suitable habitat for millipede breeding and intensive control at susceptible crop periods.

AB  - As an important indicator of water pollution, algae are highly sensitive to changes in their environment and respond to a wide range of pollutants, they provide an early caution signal of worsening ecological condition. In this article, a kind of portable microfluidic lensless depth neural network algae monitor is proposed. The lensless algae image acquisition module, algae segmentation and classification circuit, and touch panel were integrated into the equipment. Therefore, the equipment can collect and analyze algae automatically in wild water body without laboratory. In order to miniaturize the equipment and reduce the cost, lensless microfluidic channel sampling is adopted. In addition, a dual asymmetric quantization algorithm and circuit structure are proposed for the implementation of deep neural network hardware. Finally, the prototype system construction was completed. Compared with the current analysis equipment, the equipment size and hardware cost are greatly reduced, and the accuracy reduction is kept in a small range, which makes a better compromise between the accuracy, hardware cost and circuit power consumption. The performance of the equipment fully meets the needs of the current portable algae monitor equipment, and the cost is greatly reduced compared with the current equipment. The accuracy of the equipment achieves 94.27%, the size achieves 11 * 11 * 17.5cm. These advances in portability and cost are conducive to promoting the transformation of water algae analysis based on artificial intelligence from large servers in the laboratory to portable algae analysis equipment, and promoting the rapid early analysis of water monitoring.

AB  - A non-ionic hydrophobic natural deep eutectic solvent (HNADES) based on thymol and menthol was proposed for the liquid-liquid microextraction of fourteen phthalates and one adipate from environmental water samples. Separation, identification, and quantification were achieved by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The main factors affecting the extraction efficiency were thoroughly studied. Sample pH of 8 and 100 mu L of thymol:menthol at molar ratio 2:1 were selected as the best conditions, while ionic strength and type of dispersant solvent were not relevant for the extraction of the target compounds. The whole methodology was validated for treated wastewater, runoff, and pond water matrices, using di-n-butyl phthalate-3,4,5,6-d(4) and dihexyl phthalate-3,4,5,6-d(4) as surrogates. Recovery ranged from 70 to 127% with relative standard deviation values lower than 14%. Limits of quantification of the method were in the range 0.042-0.425 mu g/L for treated wastewater, 0.015-0.386 mu g/L for runoff, and 0.013-0.376 mu g/L for pond water. The methodology was applied for the analysis of real treated wastewater, runoff, and pond water samples from different places of Tenerife and Gran Canaria (Canary Islands) finding the presence of diethyl phthalate, diallyl phthalate, dipropyl phthalate, benzylbutyl phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate, bis-(2-n-butoxyethyl) phthalate, di-n-pentyl phthalate, dicyclohexyl phthalate, and bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate at concentrations between 105.2 and 3414 ng/L.

AB  - The response of macrophage aggregates in fish to a variety of environmental stressors has been useful as a biomarker of exposure to habitat degradation. Total volume of macrophage aggregates (MAV) was estimated in the liver and spleen of white perch Morone americana from Chesapeake Bay using stereological approaches. Hepatic and splenic MAV were compared between fish populations from the rural Choptank River (n = 122) and the highly urbanized Severn River (n = 131). Hepatic and splenic MAV increased with fish age, were greater in females from the Severn River only, and were significantly greater in fish from the more polluted Severn River (higher concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, organochlorine pesticides, and brominated diphenyl ethers). Water temperature and dissolved oxygen had a significant effect on organ volumes, but not on MAV. Age and river were most influential on hepatic and splenic MAV, suggesting that increased MAV in Severn River fish resulted from chronic exposures to higher concentrations of environmental contaminants and other stressors. Hemosiderin was abundant in 97% of spleens and was inversely related to fish condition and positively related to fish age and trematode infections. Minor amounts of hemosiderin were detected in 30% of livers and positively related to concentrations of benzo[a]pyrene metabolite equivalents in the bile. This study demonstrated that hepatic and splenic MAV were useful indicators in fish from the 2 tributaries with different land use characteristics and concentrations of environmental contaminants. More data are needed from additional tributaries with a wider gradient of environmental impacts to validate our results in this species.

AB  - DNA modification techniques are increasingly applied to improve the agronomic performance of crops worldwide. Before cultivation and marketing, the environmental risks of such modified varieties must be assessed. This includes an understanding of their effects on soil microorganisms and associated ecosystem services. This study analyzed the impact of a cisgenic modification of the potato variety Desiree to enhance resistance against the late blight-causing fungus Phytophthora infestans (Oomycetes) on the abundance and diversity of rhizosphere inhabiting microbial communities. Two experimental field sites in Ireland and the Netherlands were selected, and for 2 subsequent years, the cisgenic version of Desiree was compared in the presence and absence of fungicides to its non-engineered late blight-sensitive counterpart and a conventionally bred late blight-resistant variety. At the flowering stage, total DNA was extracted from the potato rhizosphere and subjected to PCR for quantifying and sequencing bacterial 16S rRNA genes, fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, and nir genes encoding for bacterial nitrite reductases. Both bacterial and fungal communities responded to field conditions, potato varieties, year of cultivation, and bacteria sporadically also to fungicide treatments. At the Dutch site, without annual replication, fungicides stimulated nirK abundance for all potatoes, but with significance only for cisgenic Desiree. In all other cases, neither the abundance nor the diversity of any microbial marker differed between both Desiree versions. Overall, the study demonstrates environmental variation but also similar patterns of soil microbial diversity in potato rhizospheres and indicates that the cisgenic modification had no tangible impact on soil microbial communities.

AB  - The influence of anthropogenic disturbance on anurans can be identified by fluctuating asymmetry (i.e., small random deviations from perfect symmetry), and by organosomatic indices (i.e., relative weights of the internal organs in relation to total body weight). The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of environmental stress caused by agricultural activities in Leptodactylas macrosternum (Miranda's White-lipped Frog) and Scinax x-signatus (Venezuela Snouted Treefrog) populations in the Brazilian semi-arid region in two agricultural areas and two non-agricultural areas. We used fluctuating limb asymmetry and hepatosomatic, adiposomatic, and gonadosomatic indices as indicators of disturbance. There was asymmetry only in the femur length of L. macrosternum and in the calcaneus-phalange length of S. x-signatus, but we observed no significant differences in asymmetry between the agricultural and non-agricultural areas. There was wide variation among the four studied areas in the hepatosomatic, adiposomatic, and especially gonadosomatic indices of L. macrosternum, but no indication of a difference between individuals from agricultural and non-agricultural areas. This suggests a possible relationship with unknown local environmental characteristics or ecological factors. Moreover, L. macrosternum and S. x-signatus are species with generalist behavior that are well adapted to disturbed areas. Thus, fluctuating asymmetry and organosomatic indices may not have been capable of detecting impacts, or the stressors that could affect them were simply not present in agricultural habitats. Future studies focusing on histological variations in the gonads and evaluations of chemical contamination of organs tissue may give a better understanding of the possible impacts of agriculture on these populations.

AB  - With the demand for, and scale of, ecological restoration increasing globally, effectiveness monitoring remains a significant challenge. For forest restoration, structural complexity is a recognised indicator of ecosystem biodiversity and in turn a surrogate for restoration effectiveness. Structural complexity captures the diversity in vegetation elements, from tree height to species composition, and the layering of these elements is critical for dependent organisms which rely upon them for their survival. Traditional methods of measuring structural complexity are costly and time-consuming, resulting in a discrepancy between the scales of 'available' versus 'needed' information. With advancements in both sensors and platforms, there exists an unprecedented opportunity for landscape-level effectiveness monitoring using remote sensing. We here review the key literature on passive (e.g., optical) and active (e.g., LiDAR) sensors and their available platforms (spaceborne to unmanned aerial vehicles) used to capture structural attributes at the tree- and stand-level relevant for effectiveness monitoring. Good cross-validation between remotely sensed and ground truthed data has been shown for many traditional attributes, but remote sensing offers opportunities for assessment of novel or difficult to measure attributes. While there are examples of the application of such technologies in forestry and conservation ecology, there are few reports of remote sensing for monitoring the effectiveness of ecological restoration actions in reversing land degradation. Such monitoring requires baseline data for the restoration site as well as benchmarking the trajectory of remediation against the structural complexity of a reference system.

AB  - The agricultural reuse of urban sewage sludge (USS) modifies soil properties depending on sludge quality, management, and pedo-environmental conditions. The aim of this microcosm study was to assess C mineralization and subsequent changes in soil properties after USS addition to two typical Mediterranean soils: sandy (Soil S) and sandy loam (Soil A) at equivalent field rates of 40 t ha(-1) (USS-40) and 120 t ha(-1) (USS-120). Outcomes proved the biodegradability of USS through immediate CO2 release inside incubation bottles in a dose-dependent manner. Accordingly, the highest rates of daily C emission were recorded with USS(-1)20 (3.7 and 3.9 mg kg(-1) d(-1) for Soils S and A, respectively) after 84 d of incubation at 25 degrees C. The addition of USS also improved soil fertility by enhancing soil macronutrients, microbial proliferation, and protease activity. Protease showed significant correlation with N, total organic C, and heterotrophic bacteria, reflecting the biostimulation and bioaugmentation effects of sludge. Soil indices like C/N/P stoichiometry and metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) varied mostly with mineralization rates of C and P in both soils. Despite a significant increase of soil salinity and total heavy metal content (lead, nickel, zinc, and copper) with USS dose, wheat germination was not affected by these changes. Both experimental soils showed intrinsic (Soil A) and incubation-induced (Soil S) phytotoxicities that were alleviated by USS addition. This was likely due to the enhancement of biodegradation and/or retention of phytotoxicants originating from previous land uses. Urban sewage sludge amendments could have applications in soil remediation by reducing the negative effects of allelopathic and/or anthropogenic phytoinhibitors.

AB  - In this work we report the occurrence of powerful mutagenic 3-nitrobenzanthrone (3-NBA), in addition to 18 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 6 oxygenated PAHs and 27 nitrated PAHs in polychaete worms. Benzanthrone (BA), another important mutagenic polycyclic aromatic compound (PAC) also was detected in the samples. Polychaete annelids have great ecological relevance, being widely distributed in different environmental conditions, from intertidal zones up to seven thousand feet deep areas. They are abundantly found in both contaminated and uncontaminated areas and, therefore, used as indicators of the pollution status of a given area. As we know, so far, most of these PACs has not been previously reported in living organisms before. The 3-NBA concentrations determined in this study were within 0.11-5.18 mu g g(-1). Other relevant PACs such as PAHs, quinones and nitro-PAHs were found in maximum concentrations at 0.013 mu g g(-1) (coronene) to 11.1 mu g g(-1) (benzo[k]fluoranthene), 0.823 mu g g(-1) (9,10-phenenthrenequinone) to 12.1 mu g g(-1) (1,4-benzoquinone) and 0.434 (1-nitronaphthalene) mu g g(-1) to 19.2 mu g g(-1) (6-nitrobenzo[a]pyrene), respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA), ternary correlations and diagnostic ratios were employed in order to propose probable sources for PACs. Although statistical analysis preliminarily has indicated both pyrogenic and petrogenic contributions, petrogenic sources were predominant reflecting the impacts of petroleum exploration and intensive traffic of boats in the study area.

AB  - Over the past few decades, rivers have become severely polluted as a result of receiving vast quantities of domestic and industrial wastewater. The identification of the major factors that influence water quality is crucial to understand the interactions of anthropogenic and natural factors and develop river restoration projects. In this study, the QUAL2Kw water quality model was used to quantitatively evaluate the most critical factors for water quality at two sites with different meteorological conditions and urban scales. The genetic algorithm (GA) was used to optimize the parameters in the model. The Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method was used to assess the model uncertainty and sensitivity in all reaches for five water quality outputs (temperature, CBOD, DO, TP, and TN) in two seasons. The K-means clustering method associated with the sensitivity results was used to identify the major factors influencing the water quality in all reaches from the input data and the model parameters. The results showed that CBOD, TN, and TP were most sensitive to headwater and tributary quality. DO tended to be affected by more natural reactions than the other water quality indicators. In the cold and dry seasons and the more urbanized areas, river pollution was more severe, and the impact of natural reactions was reduced. The simulation results revealed the reliability of QUAL2Kw in modeling the quantity and quality of all river reaches. The method applied in this study is beneficial for the improvement and management of the water environment.

AB  - Estuaries are important environments for the sustainable use of natural resources; however, these coastal areas are deteriorating continuously owing to anthropogenic impact, and thus their conservation has become a global issue. This study aimed to identify the physicochemical factors that influence goby fauna and richness, which have high species diversity in temperate riverine estuaries, by conducting field surveys. We collected gobies and measured six physicochemical factors (median particle size; percentage of gravel, sand, and mud; salinity; and elevation) in the intertidal zone of two riverine estuaries flowing into the Seto Inland Sea of Japan. Twenty-six species of gobies were found at 191 sites during our surveys. To classify the survey sites by goby fauna, we stratified 132 sites, where more than two species of goby were found, into seven groups by using two-way indicator species analysis. The results of canonical correspondence analysis and classification and regression tree suggested that the goby fauna changed along these physicochemical environmental gradients. In particular, sediment characteristics might be an important factor that influences the goby fauna. However, no relationship was found between species richness of gobies, as revealed by the result of generalized linear mixed model. Therefore, our data indicate that species diversity of gobies utilising various environments cannot be maintained by conservation of a specific environment in riverine estuaries. The diversity and heterogeneity of the physicochemical environments, especially sediment conditions, need to be maintained and controlled for the conservation of the gamma diversity of estuarine goby.

AB  - Coupled change in land and water use due to increased farming intensity is a main factor affecting water quality and quantity, ecological functions and biodiversity globally. Prolonging growing seasons and increasing productivity in wetlands through irrigation have been targeted for increasing food security, particularly in developing countries. Nevertheless, irrigation and drainage have often been associated with degradation of water quality through increased agrochemical and fertiliser runoff and leaching at local scales. In this study, we investigated water quality in streams used for irrigation in a wetland area in Kilombero Valley, Tanzania. We measured physical-chemical water parameters and collected macroinvertebrates with different sensitivity to water quality across several small irrigation schemes covering various conditions. Turbidity, temperature, nitrate-N, and ammonium-N were significantly higher at sampling sites downstream of irrigation compared to upstream. Macroinvertebrate diversity, richness and average score per taxa (ASPT) were higher in general in sampling sites upstream of irrigation, with more sensitive macroinvertebrates decreasing in abundance downstream. There was a positive correlation between physical-chemical parameters and macroinvertebrate indices across the sites. We demonstrate that macroinvertebrate indices can be used as a quick assessment of water quality in response to irrigation schemes in small-scale farming systems of Tanzania. This in turn can allow us to track changes affecting wetland ecosystem function and biodiversity at higher trophic levels and across larger scales, thereby providing useful early warnings to help avoid widespread degradation under widespread agricultural intensification.

AB  - Perennial plants show traits such as long-lived leaves and higher nutrient retention that provide a more efficient use of nutrients in low-resource environments when compared to annuals. These traits do not only generate yield stability but should be relevant in the provision of regulating ecosystem services for sustainability. The understanding of the mechanisms underlying nutrient use and conservation in perennial herbaceous crops might provide useful evidence to test the potential benefits of perennial crops in low-resource environments. Using annual and perennial Physaria as a working model, we tested the link between nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), plant's life-cycle, and specific leaf area (SLA), as an indicator of C economy strategy. As expected, SLA was pivotal in determining differences in N use and conservation, except for two processes: resorption efficiency and proficiency. The maintenance of green leaf tissues through long-lived leaves in perennials may play a key role in the capacity to store carbon and nitrogen during the grain-filling phase. Perennials had 50% less leaf senescence, lost 50% less nitrogen, had higher mean residence time, and a higher nitrogen use efficiency than annuals. Photosynthetic N use efficiency and N productivity were dependent on environmental conditions: perennials which maintained a conservative strategy both years also showed a more stable biomass production. Traits relevant for the ability to minimize nitrogen losses and internal plant nitrogen turnover over multiple seasons shown by perennials may be relevant in improving both resource use efficiency and yield stability.

AB  - The relevance of this article is explained by the humanistic potential of the artistic thought of V. G. Korolenko and A. V. Gelasimov, whose works are united by problematic and thematic identity, despite the time period separating these writers. In this article, environmental thinking, expressed in literary works, is developed methodologically, which is in line with modern literary studies. The purpose of the article is to identify the general and the particular in environmental thinking of Korolenko and Gelasimov, enabling to concretize the concept of these writers' works. A comparative typological approach is applied in this research. The article proves the existence of typological similarities at different levels of the text: figurative, narrative-compositional and stylistic. It is argued that cold/frost, being a borderline situation in the fate of the heroes, becomes the leading ethical-philosophical category that forms the ideological center of the literary works. The inner conflict of the reflective hero is manifested through antinomies: love and hate, cowardice and fortitude, alienation and involvement in life, cynicism and decency, depression and a rise in vitality. Cold/frost acts as an eco-indicator, helping to check both the physical and the spiritual strength of a person. Nature and man, representing the unity, are in constant confrontation at the same time, and human ability for self-sacrifice and spiritual rebirth becomes a guarantee of survival for man. Moreover, the northern force of nature stimulates the spiritual growth of a person being put in a situation of choice by extreme conditions. The term "eco-metaphor", having a semantic core and a semantic peripheral domain created by the author is introduced into scientific circulation.

AB  - The aim of this study was to map the spatial distribution of enchytraeids and humus forms in a study area in the Italian Alps by means of a knowledge-based modeling approach. The modeled area is located around Val di Sole and Val di Rabbi (Trentino, Italy) and includes the forested parts in the range between 1100 m and 1800 m a.s.l. Elevation and slope exposure are considered as environmental covariates. Models were implemented regarding the spatial distribution of three variables at the landscape scale: 1) enchytraeids indicating mull humus forms, 2) enchytraeids indicating moderimor humus forms, 3) humus forms showing an OH horizon. All three models reveal a consistent trend of an increasing accumulation of plant residues and humus in organic layers from low to high elevations and from south facing to north-facing slopes. Validation and uncertainty analysis of input data confirm these trends, although some deviations are to be expected (RMSE values from validation sites range from 26.3 to 36.2% points). Effects of additional potentially influencing variables may lead to uncertainties of the model predictions especially at positions with particular landforms (e.g. gullies and ridges). In the high mountains environmental conditions are often quite heterogeneous due to a highly variable topography, which also affects the species composition of the decomposer community and the occurrence of different humus forms.

AB  - This study evaluated the level of household dependence on remittances, its uses and linkages with landscape/environmental conditions in South Eastern Nigeria. The study area is a landscape unit defined by the Idemili River Basin of Anambra State. The concept of socio-ecological systems provided the basis for an integrated assessment of remittances environment linkages using primary data from a survey of 840 households in 25 localities in the basin and landscape data from a Nigerias at 32 m resolution image dataset. Based on this, linear and non linear regression modelling of locality level relationships between four indicators of household remittances (HR) and a key landscape variable (vegetation cover density-VCD) was implemented. About 45 % of the households had access to remittances; 10 % of receiving households depended on it as their main income source; and over 87 % used the receipts mainly to meet basic household needs. Only 4 % of the households used it in activities that directly affected the vegetation cover. The linear and non linear relationships between the indicators of HR and VCD were generally weak (R-2 < 0.250). However, the pattern of relationship was different for various indicators of HR. It was inverse for locality aggregate (total) and average HR and positive for level of household access to remittances/locality. This illustrates the complex relationship between remittances and landscape variables in the basin. The study shows that the impact of remittances on households and the environment in the region is both positive (through the alleviation of poverty and land pressure) and negative (through reduction of vegetation cover density).

AB  - Phytoliths have proved to be reliable indicators of environmental conditions both at present and in the past, and can provide evidence for the distribution of taxa or vegetation. Understanding the environmental significance of phytoliths within plants helps in drawing more reliable inferences about palaeovegetation and in reconstructing the palaeo-environment. The present study examined the relationship between phytoliths and environmental factors to assess the environmental significance of different types of phytoliths. phytoliths were extracted from Phragmites communis growing in xero-phytic and aquatic habitats at twelve sampling sites in north-eastern China and their implications for the environment were assessed using quantitative data mainly including phytolith concentration and environmental factors and statistical analyses. Principal component analysis (PCA) of several environmental factors (including the climate, micro terrain, and the physicochemical properties of soils) revealed that other factors being constant, P: communis phytolith concentrations were influenced largely by the average annual temperature and precipitation. Orthogonal experiment analysis and three-way analyses of variance of the concentrations confirmed the reliability of the results of the PCA. More specifically, the concentrations of the saddle and rondel types of phytoliths (the short-cell phytoliths) were closely linked to the average annual temperature whereas those of the elongate, lanceolate, and bulliform phytoliths (the non-short-cell phytoliths) were more sensitive to the variations in water status. The results contribute to further confirming the major environmental implications of phytoliths and, in turn, providing a reference for growth and development of wetland plants. Our findings also provide critical information that could help managers and policymakers assess and modify ecological restoration practices. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Amphipods are widely used as bioindicator organisms, in view of their ease of collection and cultivation, sexual dimorphism and abundance, in aquatic environments. In the present study male (n=30) and female (n=30) amphipod Hyalella kaingang were collected during the middle of each season from a nature preserve (Research Center PRO-MATA) in Sao Francisco de Paula, Southern Brazil. Proteins, glycogen, lipids, triglycerides, glycerol, and lipid peroxidation (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione S-transferase activity) were measured. The results obtained for the markers of energy metabolism, antioxidant enzymes, and lipid peroxidation revealed a clear seasonal variation. The patterns of proteins, glycerol, and glutathione S-transferase activity did not differ between sexes; conversely, differential responses in males and females over the year were observed for all other parameters (glycogen, lipids, triglycerides, lipid peroxidation, and superoxide dismutase and catalase activity). These responses appear to be strongly influenced by a prolonged reproductive period (autumn through spring, peaking in autumn); by the degree of exploratory activity, particularly in the summer and autumn; and by abiotic factors, such as temperature and photoperiod. The responses observed in the summer and autumn (decrease in levels of proteins, glycogen and fats, and increase in lipid peroxidation levels and glutathione S-transferase activity), suggest that this season represents a critical time point for these animals. The parameters studied herein may be used as biomarkers to assess the environmental conditions in the aquatic habitat. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Terapa fossil vertebrate site, northcentral Sonora, Mexico, provides a rare opportunity to study the paleoenvironmental conditions present in northwestern Mexico during mid-Oxygen Isotope Stage (OIS) 3. Ostracode faunal assemblages and stable oxygen (delta O-18) and stable carbon (delta C-13) isotope values from ostracode calcite were used to reconstruct the seasonality of precipitation and vegetation cover at Terapa at 40-43 ka. The ostracode fauna was a non-analogue mix of temperate and tropical ostracode species composed of 13 species from 12 genera. The nearctic ostracodes Fabaeformiscandona caudata, Physocypria pustulosa, Cypridopsis vidua and the cosmopolitan ostracode Darwinula stevensoni dominate the assemblage. Two tropical ostracode genera, Chlamydotheca arcuata and Stenocypris sp., were present throughout the deposit and indicate that mean monthly summer temperatures were probably no more than 4 degrees C to 6 degrees C cooler than at present, based on available ecological information. Winter precipitation dominated the hydrologic cycle as evidenced by low ostracode delta O-18 values (-6 parts per thousand to -8 parts per thousand VPDB). Low ostracode delta C-13 values (-7 parts per thousand to -8 parts per thousand VPDB) suggest that local vegetation was dominated by C-3 plants. A previous tooth enamel-based paleoenvironmental reconstruction at the same site favored a summer-dominated or evaporative hydrology and abundant C-4 vegetation. The Terapa megafauna site exemplifies the need for multi-indicator paleoclimate reconstructions in desert environments where marked differences in the seasonality of precipitation and vegetation cover may occur.

AB  - Conventional commercial broiler production involves the rearing of more than 20,000 broilers in a single confined space for approximately 6.5 wk. This environment is known for harboring pathogens and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, but studies have focused on previously established houses with mature litter microbial populations. In the current study, a set of three naive houses were followed from inception through 11 broiler flocks and monitored for ambient climatic conditions, bacterial pathogens, and antibiotic resistance. Within the first 3 wk of the first flock cycle, 100% of litter samples were positive for Salmonella and Listeria, whereas Campylobacter was cultivation negative but PCR positive. Antibiotic resistance genes were ubiquitously distributed throughout the litter within the first flock, approaching 107 to 1012 genomic units g(-1). Preflock litter levels were approximately 106 CFU g(-1) for heterotrophic plate count bacteria, whereas midflock levels were >1011 colony forming units (CFU) g(-1); other indicators demonstrated similar increases. The influence of intrahouse sample location was minor. In all likelihood, given that preflock levels were negative for pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes and 4 to 5 Log(10) lower than flock levels for indicators, incoming birds most likely provided the colonizing microbiome, although other sources were not ruled out. Most bacterial groups experienced a cyclical pattern of litter contamination seen in other studies, whereas microbial stabilization required approximately four flocks. This study represents a first-of-its-kind view into the time required for bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance to colonize and establish in naive broiler houses.

AB  - Light environments can have a considerable influence on how plants respond to defoliation through influencing the biomass allocation patterns and internal C/N ratio. Seedlings of Lolium perenne, a common perennial grass species, were grown for eight weeks under three different light environments (natural light, red light and shading) and two different defoliation treatments (no defoliation versus 50% aboveground biomass removal). This study was conducted to examine (1) the effects of light regimes and defoliation on biomass accumulation, biomass allocation and internal C/N ratio status in plants; (2) how the light regimes influence the pattern of compensatory growth after defoliation; and (3) the relationship between compensatory growth and the internal C/N ratio status. We found that red light altered the shoot-to root allometry, enhanced the leaf C concentrations and induced N deficiency. By contrast, the leaf N concentrations of L. perenne were greater during shading treatment, which simultaneously enhanced shoot growth and stopped root growth. Under defoliation, red light increased shoot growth, not at the expense of root growth, which was not the same as in natural light and shading treatment. Moreover, regardless of the unclipped (no defoliation) and defoliation conditions, the L. perenne biomass partitioning between roots and shoots was significantly correlated with the leaf N concentrations and C/N ratio, indicating that allometric biomass allocation can be largely modulated by signals related to the C and N status of the plants. These results demonstrated that the leaf C and N status would be an appropriate indicator of compensatory growth after defoliation.

AB  - Recognizing the imperative need for biodiversity protection, the convention on biological diversity (CBD) has recently established new targets towards 2020, the so-called Aichi targets, and updated proposed sets of indicators to quantitatively monitor the progress towards these targets. Remote sensing has been increasingly contributing to timely, accurate, and cost-effective assessment of biodiversity-related characteristics and functions during the last years. However, most relevant studies constitute individual research efforts, rarely related with the extraction of widely adopted CBD biodiversity indicators. Furthermore, systematic operational use of remote sensing data by managing authorities has still been limited. In this study, the Aichi targets and the related CBD indicators whose monitoring can be facilitated by remote sensing are identified. For each headline indicator a number of recent remote sensing approaches able for the extraction of related properties are reviewed. Methods cover a wide range of fields, including: habitat extent and condition monitoring; species distribution; pressures from unsustainable management, pollution and climate change; ecosystem service monitoring; and conservation status assessment of protected areas. The advantages and limitations of different remote sensing data and algorithms are discussed. Sorting of the methods based on their reported accuracies is attempted, when possible. The extensive literature survey aims at reviewing highly performing methods that can be used for large-area, effective, and timely biodiversity assessment, to encourage the more systematic use of remote sensing solutions in monitoring progress towards the Aichi targets, and to decrease the gaps between the remote sensing and management communities.

AB  - Butterflies are an important indicator of the impacts of environmental change. Butterfly monitoring schemes (BMS) have provided national and Europe-wide trends in their abundance and been widely used for research. Most schemes sample sites that are self-selected by contributors and therefore tend to cover locations that are rich in butterflies. To provide a more representative assessment of butterfly populations, the wider countryside butterfly survey (WCBS) was developed with a stratified-random sample of survey sites across the UK. We compare butterfly trends from the WCBS locations against those measured from traditional butterfly transects which are typically located in areas of good quality semi-natural habitats. Across the 26 species analysed, there was a significant positive relationship between trends measured from the two schemes between 2009 and 2013, the period when both schemes were operating fully. There was a tendency (17 out of 26 species analysed) for these changes to be greater within WCBS compared to traditional BMS transects, although this effect was not consistent across comparisons between pairs of consecutive years. When assessing these individual year-to-year changes, there was however a significant correlation between the two schemes in all cases. Over relatively short time periods, weather patterns are likely to dominate butterfly population fluctuations and lead to comparable trends across monitoring schemes. Over longer time periods, differences in land management may affect habitat condition differently for protected areas versus the wider countryside and it is therefore important to maintain comprehensive butterfly monitoring programmes to detect and interpret such effects.

AB  - Ellenberg indices (light, nitrogen, reaction and water) were derived from the Environmental Change Network ground flora survey under pedunculate oak (Quercus robur (L.), 200 years) and Corsican pine (Pinus nigra var maritima ((Ait.) Melville) <60 years) at Alice Holt Forest and compared with soil factors analysed for moisture, pH and nutrients, NH4-N, NO3-N and water-soluble nitrogen (N) (Tsol N). Results from replicate plots were grouped by stand age. Soil pH rose with age except under the oldest oak. July NH4-N levels under old oak on all clay soils were double those under old pine on sandier surface deposits, but NO3-N levels were halved under the oak. Floristic indices showed an N increase with age under both species, as soil N stock also significantly rose (oak: P < 0.01, pine, P < 0.05). Ellenberg N values were significantly correlated with Tsol N under oak (P < 0.01), and loss on ignition per cent under pine (P < 0.001). There was direct relation between Ellenberg R and soil pH across both communities (P, 0.05), but Ellenberg R and N values were highly inter-correlated (P < 0.001). The combined values (Ellenberg R and N) were significantly correlated with levels of mid-summer Tsol N(P < 0.01), indicating water-soluble organic N to be a good measure of N availability to ground flora plants. Ellenberg L values rose under pine with age but decreased under oak. Measured leaf area index of oak understorey shrubs increased from 10 to 20 per cent of the total with age, contributing to the loss of floristic diversity beyond middle age.

AB  - The Intag cloud forest region of northwestern Ecuador is characterized by exceptional biodiversity, large known and unknown deposits of copper and other valuable minerals, and a high level of environmental awareness and concern among the human population. Its 1000km of rivers and streams are essential for household use, crop irrigation, livestock production and sustaining unique ecosystems. However, no published data exist on water quality in the region. This study characterizes water quality in five river systems in Intag and relates it to land use (protected forest, agriculture/pasture, urban development or mining) upstream of the sampling point. Additionally, we sampled 15 community water supply systems. Parameters measured included turbidity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, faecal indicator bacteria (FIB), nitrate, phosphate, ammonium, Ni, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, As, Cr, discharge and aquatic invertebrate diversity. Significant differences in pH, aquatic invertebrate diversity, and the concentrations of FIB, nutrients and dissolved metals were observed between land use groups. Forested streams consistently had the lowest pollutant concentrations, whereas those flowing past population centres or mining areas showed the greatest impairment. Elevated As concentrations were observed in association with abandoned mining boreholes, hot springs and wastewater discharges. FIB, nutrient and metal concentrations in water systems were similar to those in forested streams, indicating that these systems maintain water in an unpolluted condition. To preserve and enhance Intag's generally good water quality, we recommend installing wastewater treatment systems in larger towns and approaching all mining activity, including exploration, with extreme caution.

AB  - This is the first of seven papers resulting from a Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) international workshop titled The Influence of Global Climate Change on the Scientific Foundations and Applications of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. The workshop involved 36 scientists from 11 countries and was designed to answer the following question: How will global climate change influence the environmental impacts of chemicals and other stressors and the way we assess and manage them in the environment? While more detail is found in the complete series of articles, some key consensus points are as follows: (1) human actions (including mitigation of and adaptation to impacts of global climate change [GCC]) may have as much influence on the fate and distribution of chemical contaminants as does GCC, and modeled predictions should be interpreted cautiously; (2) climate change can affect the toxicity of chemicals, but chemicals can also affect how organisms acclimate to climate change; (3) effects of GCC may be slow, variable, and difficult to detect, though some populations and communities of high vulnerability may exhibit responses sooner and more dramatically than others; (4) future approaches to human and ecological risk assessments will need to incorporate multiple stressors and cumulative risks considering the wide spectrum of potential impacts stemming from GCC; and (5) baseline/reference conditions for estimating resource injury and restoration/rehabilitation will continually shift due to GCC and represent significant challenges to practitioners.

AB  - Background: Recent reviews question current animal models of depression and emphasise the need for ethological models of mood disorders based on animals living under natural conditions. Domestic horses encounter chronic stress, including potential stress at work, which can induce behavioural disorders (e. g. "apathy"). Our pioneering study evaluated the potential of domestic horses in their usual environment to become an ethological model of depression by testing this models' face validity (i.e. behavioural similarity with descriptions of human depressive states).
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We observed the spontaneous behaviour of 59 working horses in their home environment, focusing on immobility bouts of apparent unresponsiveness when horses displayed an atypical posture (termed withdrawn hereafter), evaluated their responsiveness to their environment and their anxiety levels, and analysed cortisol levels. Twenty-four percent of the horses presented the withdrawn posture, also characterized by gaze, head and ears fixity, a profile that suggests a spontaneous expression of "behavioural despair". When compared with control "non-withdrawn" horses from the same stable, withdrawn horses appeared more indifferent to environmental stimuli in their home environment but reacted more emotionally in more challenging situations. They exhibited lower plasma cortisol levels. Withdrawn horses all belonged to the same breed and females were over-represented.
   Conclusions/Significance: Horse might be a useful potential candidate for an animal model of depression. Face validity of this model appeared good, and potential genetic input and high prevalence of these disorders in females add to the convergence. At a time when current animal models of depression are questioned and the need for novel models is expressed, this study suggests that novel models and biomarkers could emerge from ethological approaches in home environments.

AB  - Well-preserved dome-shaped carbonate stromatolites occur in the lowermost part of the Sinemurian of the Lusitanian Basin (Portugal), at S. Pedro de Moel region (W of the basin). Deposition in the region took place on a westward-dipping carbonate ramp. The stromatolitic mounds are not found anywhere else in the Sinemurian of the basin and therefore are regarded as specific bioevents. In contrast to marginal-marine stromatolitic crusts, subtidal carbonate mounds other than sponge-mounds have been seldom reported in the Lower Jurassic, in particular in the Sinemurian, either from Europe or North-Africa. Therefore, the case documented here contributes to enhance the knowledge on stromatolites of this age in the Peri-Tethyan and Proto-Atlantic regions. The depositional setting of the studied succession is interpreted as a mainly low-energy, restricted marine one, punctuated by higher-energy episodes and, locally, subjected to more open marine influence. The existence of a topographic high and detached shoals at a more distal location of the ramp is likely, considering regional seismic evidence, the record in offshore (to the W) wells of peloidal/ooid wacke-packstones with detrital quartz and occurrence of a few ooid grainstones in the studied section. The inferred positive relief would act as a physical constraint that, coupled with the low-gradient of the ramp, defined an embayment-like environment in which the prevailing ecological conditions must have been, for the part of the succession bearing the stromatolites, unfavorable for many benthic organisms, favoring the microbial community. The upper part of the succession suggests stepwise environmental openness to more marine influence alternating with frequent environmental restriction.

AB  - Water level fluctuations of Lake Afourgagh (Middle-Atlas Mountains, Morocco) over the last 2500 years (Late Holocene) have been reconstructed using charophyte remains in the lake sediment archives. The study involved 22 pits (1-3 m deep) dug along a transect across the lake shore terrace. Biogenic activity appears to be a dominant contributor to the accumulation of the lake sediments, as the thickest deposits are tufas composed of charophyte-encrusted stems with numerous gyrogonites (termed "charophyte tufas"). The gyrogonites were identified as Chara aspera and Chara hispida remains. The spatial distribution of these two species, measured vertically within a single core and horizontally along the shore terrace, varies according to bathymetry. Shallow proximal environments are characterized by the development of C aspera, whereas C. hispida remains are mostly observed in distal sediments. Moreover, according to their ecological characteristics, the C. hispida belt migrated proximally when the water level rose, whereas the C. aspera belt migrated distally when the water level fell. These trends were observed successively in a single charophyte tufa layer which records the rise, highstand, and fall of lake level in a single depositional sequence. The late Holocene palaeobathymetry of Lake Afourgagh was inferred by comparing data on charophyte remains and deposit geometry. Data provide evidence for four major low lake level phases (estimated in terms of amplitude) which induced the development of palaeosols in proximal settings at 2191 cal. BP, 1769 BR 1515 cal. BP and 1062 cal. BP. These results confirm the accuracy of charophyte-based palaeobathymetry studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reconstruction of late Quaternary sea level history in areas of glacioisostatic uplift often relies on sediment archives from coastal isolation basins, natural coastal rock depressions previously isolated from or connected to the sea at different times. Proxy indicators for marine, brackish, or lacustrine conditions combined with precise dating can constrain the time when the sea crossed the sill threshold and isolated (or connected) the basin. The utility of isolation basins in investigations of sea level change is well known, but investigations have been mostly limited to microfossil proxies, the application of which can be limited by preservation and nonanalog problems. Here we investigate the potential of long-chain alkenones, alkenoates, and bulk organic parameters (TOC, Corg/N) for reconstructing past sea level changes in isolation basins in NW Scotland. We analyze organic biomarkers and bulk parameters from both modern basins (at different stages of isolation from the sea) and fossil basins (with sea level histories reconstructed from established proxies). Logit regression analysis was employed to find which of the biomarker metrics or bulk organic measurements could reliably characterize the sediment samples in terms of a marine/brackish or isolated/lacustrine origin. The results suggested a good efficiency for the alkenone index %C-37:4 at predicting the depositional origin of the sediments. This study suggests that alkenones could be used as a novel proxy for sea level change in fossil isolation basins especially when microfossil preservation is poor.

TI  - Ecoforecasting in real time for commercial fisheries: the Atlantic white shrimp as a case study
T2  - MARINE BIOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - NETWORKS
AB  - Predictive modeling of natural resources has long relied on mechanistic descriptions incorporating various population attributes and to a lesser extent environmental conditions. A radical departure from this tradition is proposed, advocating the data-driven analysis and forecasting of population cycles from historical records, and using the Atlantic white shrimp, Litopenaeus setiferus, as a case study. The time series data were collected in the Charleston Harbor (32 degrees 47'00 '' N, 79 degrees 56'00 '' W), South Carolina, USA, and from the database of the National Marine Fisheries Service (http://www.st.nmfs.gov/st1/commercial/index.html), for the period between January 1986 and December 2004. Correlations between shrimp population cycles and environmental hydrological parameters were established by phase space reconstruction, a technique central to most nonlinear time series analysis methods. Predictive models of future shrimp population levels were built using feed-forward artificial neural networks, a well-known machine learning technique. From several attempted strategies, predicting the state commercial harvest from the sampling of populations in the Charleston Harbor conducted by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources proved to be optimal, with an accuracy of 92% for 1-month and 79% for 3-month ahead predictions, as measured by the nonparametric and nonlinear Spearman's correlation coefficient. In addition, the shrimp population levels seem to be more sensitively to changes in surface water temperature than salinity, but the latter is also an important consideration. These models also suggest that catch-per-unit-effort data are important indicators of commercial harvest and, thus, provide an important linkage between monitoring programs and commercial returns, enabling accurate predictions of natural resources to be made in near real time and extended beyond the critical time frames within which resource managers operate.

AB  - A framework for landscape monitoring based on a functional approach is presented. Landscape monitoring is defined as regular, long-term surveillance of landscapes. Suitable monitoring resulting in the early recognition of crucial changes in the environment is a prerequisite if timely counteractions are to be carried out. Such monitoring provides spatially and temporally homogeneous data sets, and allows for adjustment to and validation of ecological models. The peculiarities of the framework presented are as follows. Landscape functions, and ecological conditions and processes are scrutinized from a strong human perspective. The procedure employs various methods based on models, balances, calculations and estimations. Thus, far-reaching data integration is possible, which allows for the drawing of conclusions which are important for human society. The landscape monitoring proposed also follows a differentiated scale-dependent approach (at local, sub-regional and regional levels) with a stepwise integration of data. Data sampling and analysis are organized according to a scale-dependent set of assumptions allowing a problem-oriented floodplain in Saxony (Germany). The assessment proposed also approach. The framework is exemplified by changes in soils in a small (16.1 km(2)) takes into account historical data. Essential changes in soils have been established, e.g. losses in humus, deposition of soils by excavation matter and peat degradation. It was found that the percentage of arable land increased, and the groundwater level decreased in several areas. This finds expression in several physical and chemical parameters, e.g. in reduced field and sorption capacities. Therefore, the performances of soil protection functions and of production functions became worse. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Some of the Biomphalaria species living in Chaco, such as B. straminea and B. tenagophila, are natural transmitters of schistosomiasis in Brazil, while those of the genus Drepanotrema are not intermediate hosts of the disease. The aim of the present work was to analyze the importance of a selected set of environmental variables in explaining patterns of distributions and relative abundance of planorbid gastropod assemblages. The study sites were located in urban areas of Resistencia City, Chaco Province, and the environmental variables measured were substratum (macrophytes), water quality (pH, O-2, nutrients, among others), as well as other gastropods (Ancylidae, Hydrobiidae and Ampullaridae). Seasonal samplings were carried out in four distinct environments. Thirty-one quantitative samples of gastropods and environmental variables were obtained. In canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), seven environmental variables were retained after a stepwise forward selection, from a total of 26, including [N-NH4+], O-2%, and the macrophytes Eichhornia crassipes, Pistia stratiotes, Panicum elephantipes, Hydrocotyle ranunculoides and Canna glauca. They explained 62% of the variation in planorbid association. Canna glauca was the most significant variable, being positively correlated with all of the species of Drepanotrema. Axis I separates B. tenagophila from B. straminea, along a gradient related to increasing O-2% and R elephantipes abundance, as well as decreasing [N-NH4+] and P stratiotes. Axis II separates D. lucidum, D. anatinum and D. cimex from the other planorbid species along a gradient associated with decreasing abundances of H. ranunculoides and C. glauca. Some common aquatic macrophytes, and to a lesser extent, dissolved oxygen and ammonium in water, may be useful indicators of favorable environmental conditions for potential intermediate hosts of schistosomiasis in Chaco Region.

AB  - Examining marine ecosystems in a distinct way can produce new ecological, theoretical and applied insights. The common "S" and "hockey stick" -shaped curves, which result from examining the cumulative biomass and trophic level and the cumulative production and cumulative biomass curves of marine ecosystems, have strong potential to elucidate the mechanisms of marine food webs. These curves are based on the cumulative trophic theory, which can be summarized as the integration of biomass and production across trophic level that results from the relatively simple trophic transfer equation. Here we test the behavior of this theory via modeled simulations of the transfer equation under a variety of common mechanisms that can influence marine ecosystems. The simulated scenarios we present and evaluate here explore bottom-up driven changes (production, growth), internal dynamics (transfer efficiency) or top-down driven changes (mortality, selectivity), as well as multi-mechanism scenarios (overfishing and eutrophication) that are commonly experienced in marine ecosystems. We explore these scenarios at high, medium or low levels of change for each feature to ascertain how they can result in major changes to the realized trophodynamics of a marine ecosystem. Our results lend credence to the generality of the cumulative trophic theory by predicting the empirically observed "S" and "hockey stick" -shaped curves under a wide range of possible mechanisms. Given that common, repeatable and predictable dynamics is a key hallmark of increasingly robust theories, the application of cumulative trophic theory in managing marine ecosystems enables more repeatable and predictable responses across a wide range of conditions.

AB  - Green growth is about merging environmental and social protection with economic growth. The OECD countries follow the progress toward greening though a set of indicators. The aim of the study is to analyze the condition and development of the OECD countries using a set of green growth indicators. The univariate and multivariate statistical approach was used to identify the main features of green growth development in two time spans. The achieved success of the OECD countries toward the green growth was measured from period 1 (years 2000-2009) to period 2 (years 2010-2019). For stimulant indicators, an increase was achieved, while for the destimulant variables, a decrease was reached between the analyzed periods. CO2 productivity increased by more than 31%, material productivity by 25%, and the energy productivity by nearly 21%. From the ecological point of view, a positive sign was achieved by an intensive increase of the percentage of municipal waste treatment by recycling or composting. The real GDP increased between periods in each of the OECD countries, except in Greece. The destimulant indicators decreased over time. The mortality declined by about 20% from exposure to ambient PM2.5 and thus the welfare costs of premature death from exposure to PM2.5 also declined. The decline of the mean population exposure to PM2.5 by 12.5% on average for the OECD countries is a positive signal for environmental protection and public health of the OECD population. Some uncertainty exists as the municipal waste generated per capita decreased only slightly by 2%.</p>

AB  - Sea bass (Lateolabrax maculatus) is the third largest maricultured fish in terms of abundance on mainland China. However, sea bass has been reported to be susceptible to infection by a series of microbial pathogens, endangering the sustainable development of its mariculture. Therefore, there is a need to clarify the relationship between the occurrence of sea bass disease and the surrounding microbial communities, and to verify particular bacterial assemblages that indicate its health status (either healthy or diseased), with important implications for the sustainable development of sea bass aquaculture. In the current study, water samples were collected from two open-air aquaculture ponds with high and low sea mass mortality in the Doumen district of Zhuhai, South China. The contrasting bacterial community composition and function of the two sea bass ponds, and the driving effects of the environmental conditions were investigated. There was a significantly positively correlation between community structure and community function, with both in the high-mortality pond being significantly different (P < 0.05) from those in the low-mortality pond, with temperature, PO43-, dissolved oxygen, and NO(3)(-)driving the difference. The relative abundance of five potential disease indicators (Sporichthyaceae, Saprospiraceae, Chitinophagaceae, Microbacteriaceae, and Burkholderiaceae) increased, whereas that of the potential health indicator Moraxellaceae decreased in the high-mortality pond. These six indicators are likely to affect sea bass survivability by being involved in the decomposition of animal remains, producing antibiotics, and degrading other organic materials. Thus, the results of the current study provide indirect evidence for the use of aquatic microbiota composition as a biological indicator to evaluate the occurrence of sea bass diseases.

   This study was focused on differences in microbial varieties in common carp living in two different environments: open fish ponds and in nature. The results demonstrated that wild fish carry more than 2.5 times the bacterial species in their gut compared with aquacultured fish. More than 400 species of bacteria were identified, the majority of which are considered beneficial microbiota. Besides bacterial variety, it was determined that aquacultured fish harbored more bacteria that are treated as pathogens in animals and humans. The frequency of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial indicators was more common in aquacultured fish compared with bacteria from a wild population, therefore fish farming can be treated as a potential source of environmental contamination with antimicrobial resistant bacteria.
   In this study we analyzed differences in microbial composition and antimicrobial resistance profiles in common carp living in two different environments: fish ponds, where carp have been kept under the same growing conditions over the last 50 years, and from the wild. The results demonstrated that wild fish carry a great variety of bacterial species (448 species with a prevalence of at least 0.01% from the total number of reads). Aquacultured individuals harbored 2.56 times fewer species in their gut. Significant microbial differences were observed in all taxonomic ranks, including bacterial classes and phyla. Besides bacterial variety, it was determined that aquacultured fish harbored more bacteria that are considered pathogens or opportunistic pathogens, such as Moraxellaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, and Staphylococcaceae. The frequency of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial indicators was more common in aquacultured fish than in wild fish, therefore fish farming may be a potential source of environmental contamination with antimicrobial resistant bacteria.

AB  - The city of Ilheus (Bahia) has been going through an accelerated urbanization process in recent years, and today the south zone is particularly prominent, which can make beach areas more fragile and environmentally vulnerable. In this context, the issue of altering the landscape and the implications arising from these interferences are important, since the city is based on the coastal plain, a naturally fragile environment that denotes restrictions on use. In this sense, this research aimed to briefly analyze the causes and effects of urban expansion in the south of the city of Ilheus, focusing on the fragilities and potential of the environment, in addition to understanding the accelerated urbanization of this area, especially in the last two decades and changes arising from different land uses. The methodology started with a theo retical basis on the theme addressed, in addition to a characterization of the physical aspects of the study area and its historical approach, using as a subsidy the analysis of data from the census sectors available on the 2010 Census website ( IBGE, 2010), a mapping of land use and occupation, and extensive fieldwork, focusing on environmental pollution indicators on the beaches in the study area and environmental vulnerability and fragility. Such concerns are amplified as Ilheus tries to establish itself as a tourist city, whose scenic beauty in the south zone, for example, fosters this expectation, which, however, in the absence of adequate planning, tourism can come added to harmful impacts in the middle, even in such a way as to make such activities unfeasible.

Shannon-Weaver alpha diversity of the numbers of species value was higher (3.972) than the mean index value of all samples (2.945) with relatively low standard error (0.264). Six species (Psychrodromus olivaceus, P. fontinalis, Heterocypris incongruens, Potamocypris fulva, P. fallax and Ilyocypris bradyi) encountered most frequently contributed more than 90% of diversity in four different habitat types (lake, creek, trough and canal) of 11 sampling sites. Two positive co-occurrences (p < 0.05) were found for P. olivaceus-I. bradyi, and P. olivaceus-I. inermis. Canonical correspondence analyses explained 60.5% of the variance between 12 asexual species and environmental variables. Water temperature, dissolved oxygen and elevation were the most predictive variables for species found in five different habitats (lake, creek, trough, canal and ditch). Ordination on the first axis of the species negative filter method characterized the sites (samples) by the presence of rare (negative indicators) and common (positive indicator) species in opposite ends. According to TWINSPAN analysis, these species as the key members (indicators) of that particular habitat(s) can be used to distinguish characteristics of habitats. Overall, multiple regression models suggested that rather than focusing on one particular species, two or more ostracod species or the so-called indicator species group can also be used for habitat type(s) and/or aquatic condition(s).

AB  - Primates have long been used as indicator species for assessing overall ecosystem health. However, area-wide census methods are time consuming, costly, and not always feasible under many field conditions. Therefore, it is important to establish whether monitoring a subset of a population accurately reflects demographic changes occurring in the population at large. Over the past 35 years, we have conducted 15 area-wide censuses in Sector Santa Rosa, Costa Rica. These efforts have revealed important trends in population growth patterns of capuchin monkeys following the protection and subsequent regeneration of native forests. During this same period, we have also intensively studied a subset of the capuchin groups. Comparing these two datasets, we investigate whether the population structures of the closely monitored groups are reliable indicators of area-wide demographic patterns. We compare the overall group size and the individual age/sex class compositions of study groups and nonstudy groups (i.e., those contacted during area-wide censuses only). Our study groups contained more individuals overall with a larger proportion of infants, and there were indications that the proportion of adult and subadult males was lower. These differences can be ascribed either to sampling errors or real differences attributable to human presence and/or better habitat quality for the study groups. No other sex/age classes differed, and major demographic changes were simultaneously evident in both study and nonstudy groups. This study suggests that the Santa Rosa capuchin population is similarly impacted by large-scale ecological patterns observable within our study groups.

AB  - "Sterile inflammation" is a type of pathogen-free inflammation which may be induced by various physical, chemical, or metabolic insults, including environmental particles e.g. silica dioxide crystals and asbestos. The possible role of nanomaterials as danger signals able to trigger sterile inflammatory responses is not yet fully understood. Therefore, the aim of this review was to investigate conditions of sterile inflammation induced by nanomaterial exposure with a specific focus on possible modes of action. Metal-, metal-oxide- and carbon-based nanomaterials may trigger a sterile inflammatory cascade by means of different damage-associated molecular patterns, including chromatin associated protein high-mobility group box-1 secretion, ATP, ADP and adenosine purinergic signaling, interleukin-1 alpha alarmin, and NLPR-3 inflammasome activation. However, such preliminary results do not enable us to draw definite conclusions regarding the sterile inflammatory potential of nanomaterials and possible underlying molecular mechanisms. Therefore, further research is required to understand the complex "interplay" between the multitude of nanomaterial intrinsic or acquired physico-chemical properties and the extremely changeable immunological competence of organisms. The identification of possible nano material modes of action in sterile inflammation could provide early indicators of the biological reactivity of nano-sized chemicals and could direct "safe by design" efforts for improving occupational safety and that of the general population. Moreover, the possible pathological consequences of nanomaterial-induced sterile inflammatory reactions need to be clarified in order to define suitable preventive measures to protect the health of chronically exposed subjects.

AB  - A 2-year field trial was carried out in a climate change context on organic tomato crop. The objectives were: (1) to study the best synergistic combination of a set of agro-ecological techniques, as potential adaptation strategies in Mediterranean environment [i.e.: soil surface shaping; crop rotations; cover crops introduction (barley, vetch and their mixture); cover crop termination techniques (roller crimper-RC vs green manure-GM) and organic fertilization]; (2) to evaluate the sustainability of these techniques by assessing energetic performance. In both years, the barley-RC and mixture-RC combinations reduced weeds fresh and dry weights. In 2014, the combination of commercial organic fertilizer and vetch gave both the highest tomato marketable and total yields (26.88 and 31.97 t ha(-1), respectively). In 2015, these production parameters decreased by 30.7 and 35.4%, respectively compared to 2014, and GM-cover crop produced on average more than twice as much as RC-cover crop. The cover crop termination by RC reduced soil mineral N peak than GM treatment, at full flowering in particular in plots after vetch and in the mixture plots in 2014 and 2015 respectively, thus reducing the potential environmental impact by nitrate leaching. The highest energy consuming input was fertilizers (by 57%). The highest energy efficiency and net energy were found in the vetch-GM combination (with low fertilizer input). The research points out that agronomic practices must be fine-tuned to the specific pedoclimatic condition for an efficient use of energy. Moreover, agronomic input reduction is not only feasible, but also creates environmental benefits.

AB  - Enterococcus faecalis bacteria have been recently reported for their ability to host bacteriophages that are specifically from human sewage, suggesting their application to track human fecal contamination in water resources. However, little is known about the survivability of sewage-specific enterococcal bacteriophages in various water matrices under ambient and storage conditions. In this study, bacteriophages that were derived from the Thailand-isolated E. faecalis strains AIM06 and SR14 exhibited morphologies consistent with the Siphoviridae, Podoviridae, and Myoviridae families. Four representative bacteriophages were separately spiked into environmental water samples (n = 7) comprising freshwater and seawater with low- and high-pollution (LF, HF, LS, and HS, respectively) levels, defined according to Thailand Water Quality Standards. All bacteriophages decayed fastest in HS or HF samples at 30 A degrees C, reaching a 5-log(10) reduction in 2.2 to 9.8 days, and slowest in LS samples, requiring 8.8 to 23.5 days. The decay rates were 5 to 53 times lower at a storage temperature of 5 A degrees C. HF samples could be stored for as little as 2.5 days to prevent the decay of 50% of the phages. Myoviridae phages decayed faster than Siphoviridae phages and Podoviridae phages in most water matrices at 30 A degrees C. Moreover, the decay rates were 1.8 to 92 times slower in filtered samples, emphasizing a strong role for water constituents, i.e., suspended solids and natural microorganisms, in phage persistence. This study emphasized that differential enterococcal bacteriophage persistence should be considered when planning the monitoring and interpreting of fecal sources by microbial source tracking.

AB  - Mountain highways in China are located in various natural geographical areas with intense tectonic activity, steep topography and a high frequency of extreme precipitation events. These conditions make the highways vulnerable to the occurrence of multiple large debris flows simultaneously during heavy rainfall. To manage this hazard risk, a broader understanding of the hazard effects of debris flows and the vulnerability of highways is needed to reduce the losses resulting from these hazardous events. Accordingly, we analysed the effects of debris flow hazards on mountain highways and established an updated systematic indicator system to describe the vulnerability of highway infrastructure and movable hazard-affected objects. Next, we proposed a new integrated model of highway vulnerability based on the environmental sensibility, structural properties and functional effects of the highway infrastructure and on the exposure probability and quantity of movable hazard-affected objects. By analysing the characteristics of elements affected by debris flows, we developed a systematic and quantitative method of vulnerability assessment for mountain highways. Finally, this implemented method was applied to a case study in the Xiqu section of the Sichuan-Tibet Highway, an area seriously affected by debris flows during each rainy season. The hazard characteristics of disasters were analysed, and the affected highway sections were divided into four vulnerability levels. The analysis of the results indicated that the calculated vulnerability coincides with the actual effects of the disaster, which strongly suggests that the vulnerability assessment generated by the proposed method can serve as a pertinent guide for route selection, road rehabilitation and hazard mitigation of highways affected by debris flows in mountainous regions.

AB  - Wildlife conservation and management on military lands must be accomplished in the context of military readiness, which often includes ground-based training that is perceived to conflict with wildlife needs and environmental regulations. From 2008. 2012, we examined territory density, pairing success, and fledging success of the federally endangered golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia; hereafter warbler) in relation to removal of small-diameter trees from the understory of mature oak-juniper (Quercus-Juniperus) woodland at the 87,890 ha Fort Hood Military Reservation in central Texas. Understory thinning created troop maneuver lanes, but left canopy vegetation intact. Warbler density, pairing success, and fledging success were similar across thinned and control sites. We found that warbler pairing and fledging success were best predicted by Ecological site (hereafter Ecosite), an indicator of hardwood tree species composition. Warbler pairing and fledging success were about 1.5 and 1.6 times higher, respectively, for territories dominated by the Low Stony Hill Ecosite than territories dominated by the Redlands Ecosite. Our results indicate that understory thinning for military training purposes did not have a negative effect on warblers at Fort Hood in the manner tested, and suggest that removal of smaller trees from the understory in a way that replicates historic conditions may elicit neutral responses from this forest-dependent songbird. Quantifying wildlife responses to military activities provides the Department of Defense and US Fish and Wildlife Service with data to guide conservation of threatened and endangered species on Department of Defense facilities while maintaining the military mission, and supports wildlife management efforts on other public and private lands.

AB  - Over the last decades, there has been a growing interest in evaluating the predicted potential impacts of future climatic conditions on ecosystem functioning. Ecological indicators developed to assess ecosystem functioning strongly rely on soil and vegetation variables.
   In the current investigation, we evaluated the structural and functional status of a southern Mediterranean Stipa tenacissima steppe along an increasing aridity gradient. We estimated also the predicted effects of aridity on their functioning.
   The wide variation of LFA indices, vegetation structural attributes and soil properties among the different study sites revealed structural and functional heterogeneity in S. tenacissima steppes with the increasing aridity. Correlations obtained between LFA indices and most patch attributes showed the importance of vegetation structural attributes on the functioning of S. tenacissima steppes. On the other hand, correlations found between LFA indices and most measured soil variables verified the significance of LFA indices in monitoring soil functioning in southern Mediterranean S. tenacissima steppes.
   The strong negative relationships observed between aridity and stability, nutrient cycling indices demonstrated that increasing aridity can reinforce erosive processes and deteriorate nutrient cycling (i. e. aridity decreased soil carbon, nitrogen and enzymatic activities).
   Similarly, aridity was negatively related to vegetation structural attributes including patch cover and landscape organization index. This finding suggests that any increase in aridity can promote the loss of perennial vegetation cover.
   The current investigation highlighted that predicted increasing aridity will dramatically affect the functioning of southern Mediterranean S. tenacissima steppes, especially in the more arid areas. (C) 2015 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Montado decline has been reported since the end of the nineteenth century in southern Portugal and increased markedly during the 1980s. Consensual reports in the literature suggest that this decline is due to a number of factors, such as environmental constraints, forest diseases, inappropriate management, and socioeconomic issues. An assessment on the pattern of montado distribution was conducted to reveal how the extent of land management, environmental variables, and spatial factors contributed to montado area loss in southern Portugal from 1990 to 2006. A total of 14 independent variables, presumably related to montado loss, were grouped into three sets: environmental variables, land management variables, and spatial variables. From 1990 to 2006, approximately 90,054 ha disappeared in the montado area, with an estimated annual regression rate of 0.14 % year(-1). Variation partitioning showed that the land management model accounted for the highest percentage of explained variance (51.8 %), followed by spatial factors (44.6 %) and environmental factors (35.5 %). These results indicate that most variance in the large-scale distribution of recent montado loss is due to land management, either alone or in combination with environmental and spatial factors. The full GAM model showed that different livestock grazing is one of the most important variables affecting montado loss. This suggests that optimum carrying capacity should decrease to 0.18-0.60 LU ha(-1) for livestock grazing in montado under current ecological conditions in southern Portugal. This study also showed that land abandonment, wildfire, and agricultural practices (to promote pastures, crops or fallow lands) were three significant variables influencing montado loss.

AB  - Background: Bee pollen, a type of floristic pollen collected by honeybees, is extracted at the hive entrance using a pollen trap, and had mixed with saliva and gland secretions. Considering its natural origin, pollen may be contaminated with pollutants due to hidden environmental factors and extensive application of pesticides. Because of their environmental persistence and prevalence in various environmental mediums, POPs can be encountered by forage bees and carried back to hives. The aim of the present study was to develop an analytical method for simultaneous determination of trace levels of 16 PAHs, 14 OCPs and 7 PCBs in bee pollen.
   Methods: A new method was developed using QuEChERS/GC-MS. For the initial extraction step, QuEChERS Extract Tubes based on the AOAC method for the acetate-buffered version were used. The following tubes were used for the subsequent cleanup step: dispersive tubes.
   Results: Recoveries of target analytes under optimized conditions ranged from 51.3% to 138.8%. Limits of detection and limits of quantification were lesser or equal to 5.8 and 19.2 mu g/kg, respectively. The correlation coefficients of 37 target analytes were higher than 0.99. This study lays the foundation for the further research into bee pollen as an environmental indicator.
   Conclusion: The method is simple, economical, effective and robust for simultaneous analysis of 37 kinds of POPs in bee pollen matrix. The degree of environmental pollution could be evaluated by analyzing the pollutants in bee pollen samples. This study lays the foundation for the further research into bee pollen as an environmental indicator.

AB  - This study presents sedimentological, palaeoecological and geochemical data from a shallow Mediterranean coastal lagoon which has been severely influenced by human intervention over the last 70 years. The Gialova Lagoon is protected by international conventions and is listed in the Natura 2000 European Community Network as Special Protection Area (SPA) and Site of Community Importance (SCI). The spatial variability of sediment characteristics such as grain size, total organic carbon (TOC) and moment measures, mean, sorting, kurtosis and skewness were calculated. Moreover, micro- and macrofossil and sediment geochemical analyses were carried out on six gravity core samples. Study of the above parameters indicates that the anthropogenic impact and intervention are reflected in the micro- (ostracods, foraminifera, charophytes) and macrofossil (molluscs) taxa corresponding to different depositional environmental facies, representing a brackish lagoon with the influence of (a) fresh water inflow, (b) shallow marine environment and (c) hypoxic and dystrophic conditions. The geochemical characteristics and the calculation of the degree of sediment contamination using enrichment factors (EF), contamination factors (C-f(i)) and the index of geo-accumulation (I-geo) indicate a recent relative improvement of the lagoon towards the upper layers of the gravity cores, rendering the lagoon as unpolluted to moderately polluted. This combinatorial study of sediment geochemical characteristics, as well as the downcore micro-and macrofossil assemblages, can be considered as a baseline for future monitoring in accordance with European Union directives, and for any future engineering interventions for the lagoon environmental maintenance and conservation; as this is the first time that geochemical and downcore palaeoecological data have been presented from this lagoon.

AB  - Conservation agriculture (CA) in the last decades has been spread in several parts of the world, especially in South and North America and Australia. In Italy, however, its adoption is often restrained by the risk to have a reduction in crop production in the early years of transition from conventional (CT) to CA.
   To quantify sufficient financial support to promote no-tillage and CA, a mini-review about main effects of CA was conducted. The effect on crop yield, soil fertility-especially as it is influenced by the chemical, physical and microbiological factors-on soil compaction, the economic balance of the farm and the cost of equipment for direct seeding, the influence of environment on soil erosion, water retention, emissions of greenhouse gases, and carbon sequestration are briefly treated. The paper reports findings from national and international scientific literature and some results from long-term experiments conducted in Southern Italy. The main conclusions are about the reduction of yield in the first years of transition from CT to CA (from -5 to -10%), an improvement of soil fertility (soil organic carbon increases in the upper layers), reduction of management cost (less machinery operations), improvement of soil C sequestration (in specific conditions), a reduction of greenhouse gases emission and soil erosion risk.
   The paper provides the scientific basis in order to justify and quantify the amount to be paid to the farmers who decide to adopt the model of CA, oriented to protect the agro-ecosystem and to promote the principle of subsidiarity.
   Finally, a proposal of public subsidy in cash and for machinery purchase has been described.

AB  - The soil water regime is a defining ecosystem service, directly influencing vegetation and animal distribution. Therefore the understanding of hydrological processes is a vital building block in managing natural ecosystems. Soils contain morphological indicators of the water flow paths and rates in the soil profile, which are expressed as 'conceptual hydrological soil responses' (CHSR's). CHSR's can greatly aid in the understanding of hydrology within a landscape and catchment. Therefore a soil map could improve hydrological assessments by providing both the position and area of CHSR's. Conventional soil mapping is a tedious process, which limits the application of soil maps in hydrological studies. The use of a digital soil mapping (DSM) approach to soil mapping can speed up the mapping process and thereby extend soil map use in the field of hydrology. This research uses an expert-knowledge DSM approach to create a soil map for Stevenson Hamilton Research Supersite within the Kruger National Park, South Africa. One hundred and thirteen soil observations were made in the 4 001 ha area. Fifty-four of these observations were pre-determined by smart sampling and conditioned Latin hypercube sampling. These observations were used to determine soil distribution rules, from which the soil map was created in SoLIM. The map was validated by the remaining 59 observations. The soil map achieved an overall accuracy of 73%. The soil map units were converted to conceptual hydrological soil response units (CHSRUs), providing the size and position of the CHSRUs. Such input could potentially be used in hydrological modelling of the site.

AB  - There is great need to identify simple yet reliable indicators of fishing effects within the multi-species, multi-gear, data-poor fisheries of the Caribbean. Here, we investigate links between fishing pressure and three simple fish metrics, i.e. average fish weight (an estimate of average individual fish size), fish density and fish biomass, derived from (1) the parrotfish family, a ubiquitous herbivore family across the Caribbean, and (2) three fish groups of "commercial" carnivores including snappers and groupers, which are widely-used as indicators of fishing effects. We hypothesize that, because most Caribbean reefs are being heavily fished, fish metrics derived from the less vulnerable parrotfish group would exhibit stronger relationships with fishing pressure on today's Caribbean reefs than those derived from the highly vulnerable commercial fish groups. We used data from 348 Atlantic and Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment (AGRRA) reef-surveys across the Caribbean to assess relationships between two independent indices of fishing pressure (one derived from human population density data, the other from open to fishing versus protected status) and the three fish metrics derived from the four aforementioned fish groups. We found that, although two fish metrics, average parrotfish weight and combined biomass of selected commercial species, were consistently negatively linked to the indices of fishing pressure across the Caribbean, the parrotfish metric consistently outranked the latter in the strength of the relationship, thus supporting our hypothesis. Overall, our study highlights that (assemblage-level) average parrotfish size might be a useful alternative indicator of fishing effects over the typical conditions of most Caribbean shallow reefs: moderate-to-heavy levels of fishing and low abundance of highly valued commercial species.

AB  - AimThe perceived absence of young cohorts in many long-lived trees, particularly Quercus species, has raised concerns about their long-term viability. While there is a robust body of literature on valley oak (Quercus lobata) planting experiments, conducted mainly on research reserves, an assessment of natural recruitment across a range of climate and land use types has been lacking. At a regional scale over time, we explored patterns of natural recruitment in this endemic California oak reported to be experiencing persistent recruitment failure.
   LocationCalifornia.
   MethodsWe conducted a regional-scale study, including dendroecology and historical resurveys, field surveys and published planting experiments to elucidate the prevalence, timing, distribution and relation to environmental drivers of valley oak sapling recruitment.
   ResultsWe detected a substantial increase in the presence of recruitment over time at 10 sites originally surveyed between 20 and 40years ago (sites with sapling recruitment increased from 10% to 70%), potentially related to a corresponding period of relatively wetter years. We found saplings recruiting from a range of years in a variety of land management regimes, and surprisingly, sites designated as research reserves had lower recruitment than other sites. Sapling recruitment did not appear to be synchronous or episodic.
   Main conclusionsOur results indicate that sapling recruitment failure is not a persistent condition across our sites, and long-term conservation prospects for the species may be better than previously reported. Research reserves had lower natural sapling recruitment and lower seedling survival in experimental controls than other sites, and our findings highlight the importance of field data from sites with a representative range of climate and land use regimes.

AB  - The phytosociological affiliation of Tephroseris longifolia subsp. moravica, species of European importance, was studied in relation to two closely related species of the genus Tephroseris which have overlapping distribution within the Western Carpathian Mts: T. intergrifolia and T. crispa. The main aim was to compare plant communities inhabited by the three taxa, to assess the major environmental gradients responsible for variation in their distribution and to estimate ecological indicator values for Tephroseris longifolia subsp. moravica. T. longifolia subsp. moravica was recorded in nine localities in the Slovakia and Czech Republic where it occurs in very specific site conditions of ecotone habitats. Its phytosociological affiliation is restricted to grasslands of the alliances Bromion erecti and Arrhenatherion elatioris and to the ecotone vegetation between these grasslands and beech forests. T. integrifolia occurs most frequently in the Diantho lumnitzeri-Seslerion, Bromion erecti and Quercion pubescenti-petraeae alliances. T. crispa occurs predominantly in communities of the Calthion palustris alliance and Scheuchzerio-Caricetea fuscae, Mulgedio-Aconitetea and Montio-Cardaminetea classes. The major gradient responsible for variation in species composition of communities inhabited by the studied taxa was associated with moisture and nutrient content. The vascular plant-based ecological indicator values for Tephroseris longifolia subsp. moravica calculated from phytosociological relev,s with its occurrence were set for light - 6, temperature - 5, continentality - 4, moisture - 5, soil reaction - 6 and nutrients - 5. We conclude that the studied taxon has intermediate relationship to the most of the studied factors in comparison with two related species, T. crispa and T. integrifolia.

AB  - The reported fate of Escherichia coli in the environment ranges from extended persistence to rapid decline. Incomplete understanding of factors that influence survival hinders risk assessment and modeling of the fate of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and pathogens. FIB persistence in subtropical aquatic environments was explored in outdoor mesocosms inoculated with five E. coli strains. The manipulated environmental factors were (i) presence or absence of indigenous microbiota (attained by natural, disinfected, and cycloheximide treatments), (ii) freshwater versus seawater, and (iii) water column versus sediment matrices. When indigenous microbes were removed (disinfected), E. coli concentrations decreased little despite exposure to sunlight. Conversely, under conditions that included the indigenous microbiota (natural), significantly greater declines in E. coli occurred regardless of the habitat. The presence of indigenous microbiota and matrix significantly influenced E. coli decline, but their relative importance differed in freshwater versus seawater. Cycloheximide, which inhibits protein synthesis in eukaryotes, significantly diminished the magnitude of E. coli decline in water but not in sediments. The inactivation of protozoa and bacterial competitors (disinfected) caused a greater decline in E. coli than cycloheximide alone in water and sediments. These results indicate that the autochthonous microbiota are an important contributor to the decline of E. coli in fresh and seawater subtropical systems, but their relative contribution is habitat dependent. This work advances our understanding of how interactions with autochthonous microbiota influence the fate of E. coli in aquatic environments and provides the framework for studies of the ecology of enteric pathogens and other allochthonous bacteria in similar environments.

AB  - The natural environment and livelihoods in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) are significantly affected by the annual hydrological cycle. Monitoring of soil moisture as a key variable in the hydrological cycle is of great interest in a number of Hydrological and agricultural applications. In this study we evaluated the quality and spatiotemporal variability of the soil moisture product retrieved from C-band scatterometers data across the LMB sub-catchments. The soil moisture retrieval algorithm showed reasonable performance in most areas of the LMB with the exception of a few sub-catchments in the eastern parts of Laos, where the land cover is characterized by dense vegetation. The best performance of the retrieval algorithm was obtained in agricultural regions. Comparison of the available in situ evaporation data in the LMB and the Basin Water Index (BWI), an indicator of the basin soil moisture condition, showed significant negative correlations up to R = -0.85. The inter-annual variation of the calculated BWI was also found corresponding to the reported extreme hydro-meteorological events in the Mekong region. The retrieved soil moisture data show high correlation (up to R = 0.92) with monthly anomalies of precipitation in non-irrigated regions. In general, the seasonal variability of soil moisture in the LMB was well captured by the retrieval method. The results of analysis also showed significant correlation between El Nino events and the monthly BWI anomaly measurements particularly for the month May with the maximum correlation of R = 0.88.

AB  - The scale of human pressures on marine ecosystems gradually increased from local to global effects during the last centuries. Global warming, sea level rise and trans-oceanic spread of alien species are now or will be major drivers of ecological change in the Wadden Sea. Eutrophication may rank as a super-regional effect as the organic matter turnover in the Wadden Sea is driven by import from the North Sea. These effects will not necessarily be uniform across the entire Wadden Sea. A major challenge will be to understand the interactions between global factors with local conditions, both changed by human interference. A conceptual understanding of factors leading to regional differences within the Wadden Sea is only slowly evolving. Based on our understanding of the eutrophication process and a regional comparison of the eutrophication status of the Wadden Sea we propose that wider tidal basins (with a large distance between barrier islands and the mainland) generally have a lower eutrophication status than narrower tidal basins (with a short distance between barrier islands and mainland). This may be explained by a "dilution" of the imported organic matter in wider tidal basins. The interactions between global and super-regional effects on local ecological developments in the Wadden Sea will be complex and pose a major challenge to science, Wadden Sea management and the assessment of ecosystem health as required by EU legislation. The implications of integrating a North Sea view into Wadden Sea management are discussed and we conclude that the river basin approach of the EU Water Framework Directive is not appropriate for the Wadden Sea.

AB  - Current global scale land-change models used for integrated assessments and climate modeling are based on classifications of land cover. However, land-use management intensity and livestock keeping are also important aspects of land use, and are an integrated part of land systems. This article aims to classify, map, and to characterize Land Systems (LS) at a global scale and analyze the spatial determinants of these systems. Besides proposing such a classification, the article tests if global assessments can be based on globally uniform allocation rules. Land cover, livestock, and agricultural intensity data are used to map LS using a hierarchical classification method. Logistic regressions are used to analyze variation in spatial determinants of LS. The analysis of the spatial determinants of LS indicates strong associations between LS and a range of socioeconomic and biophysical indicators of human-environment interactions. The set of identified spatial determinants of a LS differs among regions and scales, especially for (mosaic) cropland systems, grassland systems with livestock, and settlements. (Semi-)Natural LS have more similar spatial determinants across regions and scales. Using LS in global models is expected to result in a more accurate representation of land use capturing important aspects of land systems and land architecture: the variation in land cover and the link between land-use intensity and landscape composition. Because the set of most important spatial determinants of LS varies among regions and scales, land-change models that include the human drivers of land change are best parameterized at sub-global level, where similar biophysical, socioeconomic and cultural conditions prevail in the specific regions.

AB  - Hydroclimatic variability is expected to be affected by global warming in the Mediterranean region where climate, fire and human activities are known to be interdependent. The latter is examined here for the past millennium by studying paleoenvironmental indicators from a sedimentary sequence at Lagunillo del Tejo (Cuenca, central Spain). Inferred changes in fire activity and lake levels are based on records of macrocharcoals and plant/algal macrofossils, respectively, and are compared with independent information on climate change and socio-economical transformations from historical and meteorological records. The results show that there is an obvious climatic forcing behind the lake-level changes recorded at Lagunillo del Tejo, and a good correlation between the periods of high fire activity/frequent fires and low lake level/drought conditions. The reconstructed fire regime may therefore be natural (climate-induced), but can also be explained by important socio-economical events/changes, including wars and the introduction of the Transhumance practices (ad 1273). There is a good chronological agreement between lowest fire activity and high lake levels (c. ad 1600-1800), concurrent with the late 'Little Ice Age' (LIA) and the collapse of the Transhumance system. We propose that periods of drought favored both natural and human-induced fires during the 'Medieval Climatic Anomaly' (around ad 1200), at the start of the LIA (around ad 1400), in the middle of the LIA (sixteenth century) and during the entire nineteenth century. This record is an example of long-term interplay between climate changes and human activities and its impact on environmental changes such as fire regimes.

AB  - Impacts on soil invertebrates are an important aspect of environmental risk assessment and post-release monitoring of transgenic insect-resistant plants. The purpose of this study was to research and survey the effects of transgenic insect-resistant cottons that had been planted over 10 years on the abundance and community structure of soil invertebrates under field conditions. During 3 consecutive years (2006-2008), eight common taxa (orders) of soil invertebrates belonging to the phylum Arthropoda were investigated in two different transgenic cotton fields and one non-transgenic cotton field (control). Each year, soil samples were taken at four different growth stages of cotton (seedling, budding, boll forming and boll opening). Animals were extracted from the samples using the improved Tullgren method, counted and determined to the order level. The diversity of the soil fauna communities in the different fields was compared using the Simpson's, Shannon's diversity indices and evenness index. The results showed a significant sampling time variation in the abundance of soil invertebrates monitored in the different fields. However, no difference in soil invertebrate abundance was found between the transgenic cotton fields and the control field. Both sampling time and cotton treatment had a significant effect on the Simpson's, Shannon's diversity indices and evenness index. They were higher in the transgenic fields than the control field at the growth stages of cotton. Long-term cultivation of transgenic insect-resistant cottons had no significant effect on the abundance of soil invertebrates. Collembola, Acarina and Araneae could act as the indicators of soil invertebrate in this region to monitor the environmental impacts of transgenic plants in the future.

AB  - Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) seeks to better integrate environmental considerations into the preparation and decision-snaking process of plans and programmes with a view to promoting sustainable development. Further to application of the European Directive 2001/42/EC (SEA Directive) in 2004, the body of practical SEA experience, and parallel research, has increased steadily. Yet there is a crucial element of SEA which cannot build on much experience but whose importance will grow over time - namely that of SEA monitoring.
   The paper explores the application of SEA monitoring for English Regional Spatial Strategies (RSSs). It briefly introduces the role of SEA monitoring and its legal requirements, the English approach of integrating SEA into Sustainability Appraisal (SA) and the nature of the current English Regional Planning context. The main part presents the research findings and discusses how practitioners cope with the challenges of SEA/SA monitoring - with guiding questions: why, what, who, how, when, and with what outcomes? Reflecting that monitoring is just about to start, the paper draws on measures envisaged for monitoring in the SA reports prepared for RSS, and on expert interviews. It identifies monitoring trends and highlights workable approaches as well as shortcomings. For a critical reflection the findings are mirrored briefly with SEA monitoring approaches of German Regional Plans. Although it is still early days for such monitoring, the findings indicate that there is a danger that some of the specific requirements and objectives of SEA/SA monitoring are not fully met, mainly due to insufficient databases, inappropriate institutional conditions and limited personnel and financial resources. Some recommendations are offered in conclusion. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A large component of uncertainty in ecological risk assessment (ERA) arises from the disparity between the time scale of toxicity measurements and the time scale of predictions of ERA models. It is difficult to make predictions about the persistence of populations from data from short-term toxicity tests. Reproductive toxicity tests provide data about how population growth rate (r) is reduced with toxicant exposure. Although reduction in r is believed to be one of the most important effects of toxicant exposure, its ecological significance has been difficult to quantify. For rotifers, r is typically reduced by 10 to 15% at no-observed-effect concentrations (NOEC). We investigated r reductions of 0 to 30% in time series models of the dynamics of natural rotifer populations to predict probability of quasiextinction. Computer simulations showed that small reductions in r can have large effects over long time periods. This means that purportedly safe toxicant concentrations like those at NOEC levels can reduce r so that population extinction becomes much more likely. Reductions in r greater than about 30% destine rotifer populations near certain extinction within 100 years. Simulations indicate that an r reduction of 5% (EC5) approximately doubles the probability of extinction and is probably the maximum tolerable for the long-term persistence of rotifer populations. When episodic catastrophic population reductions are coupled with r reduction, probabilities of extinction are increased substantially. Several models yielded similar results, so the conclusions do not seem strongly dependent on the form of the model. Incorporating population viability analysis into ecological risk assessments could improve our ability to define conditions required for the long-term sustainability of populations.

AB  - The mid-Atlantic region of the United States has a wide diversity of natural resources. Human pressures on these natural resources are intense. These factors have resulted in the collection of substantial amounts of environmental information about the region by EPA (both Regional and Research Offices), other governmental agencies, industry, and environmental groups. EPA Regional Offices comprehend first hand the importance of environmental data and are extremely supportive of investments in these data. Environmental data are used prominently in a variety of strategic planning and resource management initiatives. In EPA Region 3, the use of scientifically-sound environmental data is, in fact, one of our strategic programmatic goals. Environmental information is captured and assessed continuously by Regional staff, sometimes working in partnership with other Federal and State agencies, to derive relevant resource management conclusions. The restoration goals for the Chesapeake Bay are based on environmental indicators and resulting data. Attainment of the water quality objectives for streams and coastal estuaries are predicated on monitoring data. Our initiative in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands area uses environmental indicators to measure the condition of forests and streams. Landscape-level indicators will provide unique opportunities for the use of data in planning and management activities in support of the principles of community-based activism and sustainable development. Significant value is added to these data during their use by Regional managers. Regional programs, such as the Chesapeake Bay Program and several National Estuary Programs, are founded in environmental data, Environmental information is used by the Regional program managers to ascertain whether programs are accomplishing their intended objectives. Finally, Regional programs provide a crucial means for disseminating this information to broad segments of the public, so that a better informed and educated client base for effective environmental protection will develop.

AB  - Forest management has been conducted in many, sometimes opposing, directions, without any relevant environmental restriction. Thus, sweet chestnut stands have been bidirectionally transformed, alternating high forest and coppice structures, with many different management aims in mind: increasing economic benefits, favouring biodiversity conservation, improving landscape protection, etc. To test whether this type of multidirectional management can be extended to the ecological edges of a typical European forest tree, a study was conducted in central-western Iberian Peninsula. There, chestnut forests have been exploited under traditional regimes during recent centuries. Thirty forest stands were chosen after a clustered sampling process. In each of these stands, 53 variables were measured or estimated and assigned to five different data sets: silvicultural, climatic, edaphic, physiographic and floristic. The silvicultural matrix was compared with the other four by canonical correlation analysis. Almost all the data sets presented significant correlations with the silvicultural regime. Thus, it was easy to conclude that the environment is constraining chestnut forest management. Coppice has historically been confined to the highest ranges of the territory, which are exposed to the moist winds from the southwest. On the other hand, high forests have been located in drier sites. There, the forest needs to be intensively managed to avoid inter-and intra-specific competition. Under these conditions, coppice stands do not prosper. The relationships between chestnut silviculture and environment were also established for each data set. Finally, we conclude that the management of the chestnut forest has historically and interactively led to the development of coppice and high forest, on account of environmental constraints and human interests, to obtain benefits from this tree species.

AB  - Natural environments are recognized as complex heterogeneous structures thus requiring numerous multi-scale observations to yield a comprehensive description. To monitor the current state and identify negative impacts of human activity, fast and precise instruments are in urgent need. This work provides an automated approach to the assessment of spatial variability of water quality using guideline values on the example of 1526 water samples comprising 21 parameters at 448 unique locations across the New Moscow region (Russia). We apply multi-task Gaussian process regression (GPR) to model the measured water properties across the territory, considering not only the spatial but inter-parameter correlations. GPR is enhanced with a Spectral Mixture Kernel to facilitate a hyper-parameter selection and optimization. We use a 5-fold cross-validation scheme along with R-2-score to validate the results and select the best model for simultaneous prediction of water properties across the area. Finally, we develop a novel Probabilistic Substance Quality Index (PSQI) that combines probabilistic model predictions with the regulatory standards on the example of the epidemiological rules and hygienic regulations established in Russia. Moreover, we provide an interactive map of experimental results at 100 m(2) resolution. The proposed approach contributes significantly to the development of flexible tools in environment quality monitoring, being scalable to different standard systems, number of observation points, and region of interest. It has a strong potential for adaption to environmental and policy changes and non-unified assessment conditions, and may be integrated into support-decision systems for the rapid estimation of water quality spatial distribution.

AB  - The southeastern Gulf of California is located where two major ocean systems meet: the California Current at the north and the North Equatorial current at the south, however the ecosystem-level effects that have such confluence remain unknown. In this study, we compared the structure and function of this ecosystem between two periods 1994-1997 and 2006-2007. We based the comparison on food web models built with Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) modeling software and assumed local sea surface temperature anomalies (1993-2009) as an environmental indicator. We analyzed the ecosystem function using indicators estimated by EwE. We performed structural analysis using topological centrality indices to analyze the role of trophic species in the food web. We found that the structure and function of the ecosystem differed among the two periods, which were characterized by two clearly different levels of variation (low variability in 1994-1997 and high variability in 2006-2007). The total biomass, total system throughput, net production of the system, connectance and Finn's cycling index decreased from 1994-1997 to 2006-2007. The mean transfer efficiency (MTE) revealed that in the period, the energy flow among trophic levels was more efficient. During 2006/07, there was an increase in the ecosystem's organization, but at the same time, the ecosystem may have been more vulnerable to external perturbations because its resilience decreased. In relation to the structural role of trophic compartments, there were differences in both periods. We found that most groups change their trophic role under different oceanographic conditions. We discuss that the changes in the ecosystem are related to local variability in sea surface temperature. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Benthic diatoms constitute keystone assemblages in riverine ecosystems, and their structure is used to support regulatory water quality assessment. However, no standard ecotoxicological tests exist using integrated responses of the benthic diatom assemblages. This work aimed to assess whether benthic diatom assemblages are responsive to different riverine contaminants through a previously developed rapid toxicity test, supporting future attempts towards its standardization and integration in both prospective and retrospective Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) schemes. We selected two benthic diatoms assemblages likely responding similarly to pollution (similar IPS diatom index score), collected from two rivers in Northern-Central Portugal (sites: Palhal and Cabreia). Fresh whole diatom assemblages were exposed for 48 h to five model contaminants (glyphosate, imidacloprid, SDS, CuSO4, and Pb). At the end of the test, changes induced by the exposures in overall yield and in the yield of each diatom genus were assessed. The assemblage collected at Palhal was invariably more responsive and sensitive than that collected at Cabreia, both considering overall and genus-specific yields, regardless of the tested contaminant. Achnanthes, Fragilaria and Navicula were the most responsive genus, regardless of the tested contaminant or assemblage. The distinct response profiles observed for the two assemblages to the same contaminants at the same concentration ranges suggest that using this test method to support prospective ERA is inadequate. However, the method can be an asset supporting retrospective ERA, as the responses seem to be shaped by the interplay of resilience drivers promoted by the local conditions, e.g. adaptive changes in assemblage structure.

AB  - The continuous and extensive application of agrochemicals leads to the accumulation of heavy metals (HMs) and rare earth elements (REEs) in agricultural soils and their transfer in the food web with consequent relevant risks for human and ecosystem health. In this study, HM and REE concentrations were quantified in the soil of wheat crop fields conventionally managed in the agricultural areas of Sila Mountain (Southern Italy) and compared with the concentration in a field of wild herbs, used as control. Statistical analyses and principal component analysis suggested that the use of pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers contributes to the accumulation of HMs and REEs in the soil. Different accumulation patterns were recorded in treated fields as a consequence of the type and amount of agrochemical used and the crop rotation. The exposure risk associated with the transfer through the tropic levels of agroecosystem was carried out measuring the concentration of HMs and REEs in adults of Harpalus (P.seudoophonus) rufipes (De Geer, 1774) collected from each monitored site. Different accumulation patterns found in specimens from the monitored sites highlighted the ability of this generalist predator to regulate metal uptake under field conditions. The values of bioaccumulation factor (BAF) allow to defining the order of accumulation in P. rufipes which was classified as a macroconcentrator of Cd, Cu, Mg and Zn. Our results can supplement the limited information regarding the REE accumulation in soil invertebrates and may provide reference data for assessing potential environmental risks in croplands.

AB  - This paper addresses the degradation of waterborne drugs. Depending on the drug, endocrine disruption, antibiotics-resistant bacteria, (eco)toxicity etc. are common reported problems. As the existing tretment stations are not capable of completely removing those pollutants, new and highly efficient technologies should be developed for this purpose. The Fenton's reaction is a good candidate for that. However, acidic pH, sludge generation, and the need for the continuous addition of ferrous ion are problems to be overcome, e.g., by the photo-Fenton reaction. Here, the degradation of NSAIDS (salicylic acid, ketoprofen, diclofenac, paracetamol), and caffeine by the photo-Fenton process mediated by ferrioxalate with UV-LEDs was assessed. The initial concentration of each drug was 10 mg L-1 and the medium pH was set to 6.5. The optimized (response surface methodology) experimental conditions were: LEDs power: 1.768 W, CFe3+: 15.0 mg L-1, and C H2O2: 47.6 mg L-1. After 25 min, the concentrations of all studied drugs were below their respective detection limits, 30 and 40% of carbon (mineralization) and COD removals were achieved. All drugs followed a pseudo-first order degradation. Fast removals (approximately 80% in the first 10 min) and virtually identical rate constants (approximately 10(-1) min(-1)) were also achieved. The medium oxidation number of carbon ranged from 2.7 to 1.9. Phytotoxicity tests (Lactuca sativa) indicated that the proposed treatment did not generate ecotoxicity, despite the significant formation of degradation products.

AB  - The commercialization of RNA-based agricultural products requires robust ecological risk assessments. Ecological risk is operationally defined as a function of exposure and adverse effects. Information on the environmental fate of RNA-based plant-incorporated protectants is essential to define routes and duration of exposure to potentially sensitive nontarget organisms. Providing these details in problem formulation helps focus the ecological risk assessment on the relevant species of concern. Postharvest plant residue is often considered to be the most significant route of exposure for genetically modified crops to adjacent aquatic environments. Previous studies have shown that DvSnf7 RNA from SmartStax PRO maize dissipates rapidly in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. Although these studies suggest that direct exposure to DvSnf7 RNA is likely to be low, little is known regarding the fate of DvSnf7 RNA produced in plants after entering an aquatic environment. This exposure scenario is relevant to detritivorous aquatic invertebrates that process conditioned maize tissues that enter aquatic environments. To assess potential exposure to shredders, dissipation of DvSnf7 RNA expressed maize tissue was evaluated following immersion in microcosms containing sediment and water. Concentrations of DvSnf7 RNA in the tissue were measured over a duration of 21 d. The DvSnf7 RNA dissipated rapidly from immersed maize tissue and was undetectable in the tissues after 3 d. Concentrations of DvSnf7 RNA found in tissue as well as calculated water column concentrations were below levels known to elicit effects in a highly sensitive surrogate species, supporting the conclusion of minimal risk to aquatic nontarget organisms.

AB  - This paper assesses the Environmental Kuznets curve based on quantile behavior of the relationship between economic growth, forest area, agriculture production, renewable energy, and environmental degradation. The current literature generally used a single indicator to address environmental issues; however single indicator neither measures overall environmental conditions nor does specify that the environment issue is generally diminishing. Our study is the first one that used ecological footprint (EF) as an indicator to test environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis for Pakistan by employing recent approach of quantile autoregressive distributed lag (QARDL) initiated by Cho et al. (J Econ 188(1):281-300, 2015). The result of this study validates the EKC hypothesis for Pakistan and shows quantile-dependent relationship, and in that case, using the conventional methods may somewhat lead to biased results. Moreover, the rejection of the null hypothesis of parameter constancy is also confirmed by Wald test. In the long run, the findings of renewable energy consumption and forest area show significant negative effects on ecological footprints, which indicates that by increasing renewable energy usage and forest area, ecological footprints can be minimized. Interestingly, the short-term effects of agricultural production findings on EF show statistically negative results. This illustrates that EF can also be reduced in the agriculture sector by adopting environment-friendly technologies. In order to create efficient policies for environment deterioration, the empirical findings of the current analysis can be used as a guideline for policy implications.

AB  - Petroleum is a complex chemical that is a non-renewable natural resource. Among the compounds that make it up, it contains molecules known as biomarkers. The objective of this work was to compare the paleoenvironmental characteristics of the Austral Basin (A) and the Gulf of San Jorge (GSJ) using biomarkers from oil samples from these productive basins. For this purpose, the crude oil samples were subjected to an experimental approach for the separation of their aliphatic and aromatic fractions by silica gel column chromatography and the extracts obtained were analyzed separately by gas chromatography with mass detection studying the characteristic ions of interest. With the data obtained, diagnostic relationships (P/F, Ts/Tm, among others) were calculated. The results allowed identifying significant differences in the results of the biomarkers according to the basin from which the studied oil comes. The results obtained for the GJS indicate a contribution of organic matter Types I/II and II/III biodegraded under an anoxic deposition environment, presence of high salinity waters and a lithology with carbonate influence. On the other hand, the results of A suggest crude oils with a higher level of thermal maturity associated with type II/III kerogens with low or no biodegradation formed in a sub-toxic paleoenvironment from a siliciclastic bedrock with a significant presence of clays. This study shows that the well-known usefulness of biomarkers to define paleoenvironments and identify biodegradation processes is applicable to characterize the studied basins, and that it allows discriminating between crude oils from both basins.

AB  - Globally, the allocation of root-shoot biomass is a key plant-adaptive strategy for terrestrial ecosystems to enhance carbon-sequestration capacity. However, the deep mechanisms of above-/below-ground biomass distribution remain unclear, partly due to the multiple influencing factors. We thus aim to clarify the role of various factors in biomass allocation across diverse terrestrial biomes in the paper. A key indicator named root/shoot ratio (RSR) was established, and 7763 observational data-sets were collected from literature, including root biomass, shoot biomass, plant height, climate information and the geographical coordinates. Results highlighted the differences in RSR across terrestrial plants in biomes with a mean value of approximately 0.90. Grasses and boreal forest captured the highest and lowest mean RSR, respectively, while tree had a lower mean RSR than shrub and grass. Angiosperms and deciduous plants, on the other hand, have a higher mean RSR than gymnosperms and evergreen plants, respectively. Moreover, RSR is negatively correlated with mean annual temperature, precipitation, plant height and shoot biomass, but positively correlated with elevation and latitude. Redundancy analysis reflected that biotic and abiotic factors explained RSR variability similarly with a residual of 0.883. These findings support the optimal partitioning hypothesis that plants adjust their growth strategy according to different environments, and in particular, tend to partition more biomass to root systems under more stressful, low-nutrient and poor climatic conditions.

AB  - The State of Michoacan is the first producer of high quality resin in the country and Pinus oocarpa Schiede ex Schltdl is one of its most important species for the quality and high rate of production. The objective of the present study was to analyze the dendrometric and productive characteristics in relation to climate and soil of 30 trees selected as superior in resin production under natural conditions in Michoacan, Mexico.The acrisol ocrico-luvisol and chromic luvisol soils are present in the study area, under two climates (A)C(w1)(w) and Aw0(w), with an average temperature of 18 degrees C-22 degrees C, annual rainfall between 800 mm and 1200 mm and predominant relative humidity of 70%-90%. The DBH (1.3 m) of the trees varied from 31.5 cm to 89.5 cm, the total height from 9.0 m to 27.5 m, crown diameter from 5.9 m to 14.35 m, with an average resin production in five months of 10.67 kg. The variables that contributed most to resin production were climate type, clean stem height and number of resin tapping faces. The soil showed a positive correlation with clean stem height (r = 0.39). The results suggest that the semi-warm subhumid climate, Chromic Luvisol type soils and temperature favor the production of resin in P. oocarpa, so they could be used as indicators in the search for trees and areas with good resin production by this species.

AB  - The Conversion of Cropland to Forest Program is the largest ecological program of forest in China, which has significantly increased the forest coverage. However, it has been less effective than expected. Understanding the responding features of ecological benefits of forest to their biotopes, the relationships between the categories of annual eco-service value of per unit area of forest' (EV) and their biotope conditions is important for maximizing the ecological benefit of forest in the Conversion of Cropland to Forest Program. We analyzed the EV categories of three kinds of forest type in different biotopes, using the methods of specifications for assessment of forest ecosystem services in China'. The result showed that the total EV (T-ev) varied in the range of 2.6-8.0 e(4) RMBshm(-2)a(-1). The EV categories performed differently among the forest types and the biotopes. Water conservation EV was the highest and nutrient accumulation EV was the lowest in all the four types of biotopes. Correlations between EV categories and biotope indicators were also analyzed. The T-ev of the ecological forest is mainly related to slope gradient, annual average temperature and latitude, which explained 20.1%, 14.3% and 12.6% of the variability of T-ev, respectively. The T-ev of the economic forest is mainly related to annual sunshine duration, altitude, slope gradient and annual average temperature, which explained 29.8%, 17.6%, 13.5% and 9.7% of the variability of T-ev, respectively. The T-ev of the shrubbery is associated with latitude and annual average temperature, which explained 49.9% and 22.6% of the variability of T-ev, respectively.

AB  - Introduction: Knowledge of the infectious status of the Glossina is an indicator of risk of resurgence of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT). Environmental conditions have an impact on the density and diversity of both vector and Trypanosoma. The aim of the study was to determine the diversity and the infection rate of Glossina as well as the diversity of trypanosome species within habitats of an old HAT focus, in Gabon.
   Methodology: Glossina were captured in September 2012 in three ecological sites. Vavoua traps were installed for twelve days. All captured flies were identified. Glossina were selected for trypanosome identification by Polymerase Chain Reaction.
   Results: 1178 Glossina were captured: 55.8% in degraded forest, 28.9% in flood area and 15.4% in secondary forest. Glossina fusca congolensis (37%) and G.palpalis palpalis (36.4%) were the most abundant vector species. G. fusca congolensis was predominant in secondary forest and in flood area, while in degraded forest, it was G.palpalis palpalis. Trypanosoma infection rate was 30.7%, 42% in secondary forest, 32% in degraded forest and 18% in flood area. Trypanosoma congolense savannah was the main species detected (18.7%) followed by T. brucei brucei (10.7%) and T. brucei gambiense (4%). T. congolense savannah type was predominant in the secondary forest and in degraded forest (66.7% versus 55.5%).
   Conclusion: Glossina density and trypanosome infection rate varied according to the habitat within HAT focus. The density of tsetse was the highest in degraded forest while the infection rate was highest in secondary forest. Continuous disease surveillance and control measures are needed.

AB  - Saudi Arabia is an arid country with very limited water resources. The absence of surface water bodies along with erratic rainfall renders groundwater as the most reliable source of potable water in arid and semi-arid regions globally. Groundwater quality is determined by aquifer characteristics regional geology and it is extensively influenced by both natural and anthropogenic activities. In the recent past, several methodologies have been adopted to analyze the quality of groundwater and associated hydro-geochemical process i.e., multivariate statistical analysis, geochemical modelling, stable isotopes, a redox indicator, structural equation modelling. In the current study, statistical methods combined with geochemical modelling and conventional plots have been used to investigate groundwater and related geochemical processes in the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia. A total of 62 groundwater samples has been collected and analyzed in laboratory for major cations and anions. Groundwater in the study region is mostly alkaline with electrical conductivity ranging from 285-3796 S/cm. The hydro-geochemical characteristics of groundwater are highly influenced by extreme evaporation. Climatic conditions combined with low rainfall and high temperature have resulted in a highly alkaline aquifer environment. Principal component analysis (PCA) yielded principal components explaining 79.9% of the variance in the dataset. PCA indicates ion exchange, soil mineralization, dissolution of carbonates and halite are the major processes governing the groundwater geochemistry. Groundwater in this region is oversaturated with calcite and dolomite while undersaturated with gypsum and halite which suggests dissolution of gypsum and halite as major process resulting into high chloride in groundwater. The study concludes that the combined approach of a multivariate statistical technique, conventional plots and geochemical modelling is effective in determining the factors controlling the groundwater quality.

AB  - This study proposes a framework for evaluating anthropogenic nitrogen emissions and local vulnerability in order to assess regional ecological risk of human activity during a stable urbanization process. Taiwan, an isolated island with a unique environment, intensive agriculture, concentrated industries, and stable urbanization, was an ideal location for testing this framework. Local vulnerability is influenced by social characteristics, economic development, environmental protection, and other indicators related to these. Within the context of urbanization, therefore, and using official statistical data, human metabolism, agricultural and industrial production, and transportation were evaluated. The results indicate that the rate of anthropogenic nitrogen emissions decreased as the process of urbanization in Taiwan stabilized. While nitrogen emissions from agricultural production, household and industrial wastewater gradually decreased due to a reduction in the area of arable farmland, a reduction in the use of fertilizers and increased sewage treatment, nitrogen emissions from transportation increased due to higher energy consumption from vehicle use. Taiwan exhibited a higher degree of regional vulnerability in 1998 because motor vehicle density increased significantly, while rates of per capita green area and resource recovery remained relatively low. The study found that if Taiwan maintains its current conditions with respect to standard of living, agriculture, industry, and transportation, nitrogen emissions from human metabolism and agricultural and industrial production will not increase regional ecological risk, while nitrogen emissions from transportation will likely increase this risk. Therefore, this paper suggests that future environmental planning in Taiwan should prioritize low-emissions sustainable transportation.

AB  - The quality of the surface water is evaluated at the Santa Ines Industrial Complex's area of influence, in Barinas, Venezuela, with the purpose of assessing the environmental liabilities resulting from the discharge of effluents from the existing infrastructure at the site, especially the one related with oil industry; to serve as a baseline for the Environmental and Sociocultural Impact Assessment of the Batalla de Santa Ines Refinery, the largest infrastructure to be located in this complex and, finally, based on the results obtained, recommend the most suitable site for the discharge of its effluents. To define the water quality in four of the most important streams at the Complex's area of influence (Jaboncillo, El Barro, El Medio and Morrocoy), a series of samplings were carried out. The criteria for determining the quality of the water in the points sampled were defined according to the potential uses with reference to the Standards for classification and quality control of water bodies and discharges or liquid effluents, published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Venezuela on October 11, 1995. The results that define the current condition of water courses are represented through maps where the spatial and temporal variation of the quality spectrum can be appreciated. Given the affectation that the effluent discharges from the Flow Stations causes on the receiver streams in the study area, it is recommended to promptly improve and adapt the effluent treatment to reduce the environmental liabilities, as well as to locate the discharges of wastewater from The Refinery on El Barro stream, given its current level of water affectation.

AB  - Hemoglobin (Hb) is one of the most common conserved molecules found in organisms belonging to all major kingdoms of life. Chironomid midge larvae are unique among the invertebrates being the only free-living group of organisms possessing extracellular hemoglobins (Hbs) in monomeric and dimeric forms floating in their hemolymph. Remarkable ability of individual species of chironomid midges to tolerate wide range of environmental stressors prevailing in their respective ecosystems has enabled chironomids to sustain as one of the most widely distributed insects in the world. Ability of different Chironomus spp to thrive under extreme hypoxic conditions as well as in the presence of chemical pollution made chironomid midges an efficient model system to assess the effect of environmental stress in different freshwater ecosystems. The modulation of Hb concentration has been found to be a function of different type of abiotic stressors and thus Hb of chironomid midges (Ch-Hb) has attracted the attention as a potential biomarker for environmental biomonitoring. Large body of literature on Ch-Hb accumulated mainly during sixties to eighties of twentieth century has enriched our understanding of its physiological, developmental and biochemical features. Empirical as well as in-silico studies carried out in recent years provided insights into many structure-function relationships of Ch-Hb. However, for the last few decades, majority of the studies were carried out to project and validate Ch-Hb as potential bioindicator for evaluating toxicants, chemical pollutants and environmental gradients of dissolved oxygen concentration. In this review, historical development of the subject has been compiled with notes on future implications of contemporary studies on Ch-Hb.

Long-term monitoring of community changes may contribute to this understanding, complementing experimental studies on underlying mechanisms. Butterflies are particularly suitable for such analyses, because the different species cover a broad gradient of productivity, their ecological traits are well-known, monitoring data are available in a growing number of countries, and the short life history of butterflies ensures a rapid response to changing environmental conditions.
   Here, we use species-specific nitrogen optima to develop a community nitrogen index (CNI) for butterflies in the Netherlands. Over a 25-year period (1990-2015), data from the Dutch Butterfly Monitoring Scheme reveal a significant increase in the CNI in response to high nitrogen deposition levels. However, the rate of increase is declining, in close parallel with reduced nitrogen deposition loads. The continuing increase indicates that nitrogen deposition still exceeds the critical nitrogen load of butterfly communities in the Netherlands. Overall, the relative increase of butterflies from more productive environments reflects the advantage, under high nitrogen availability, of mobile and multivoltine species with high reproductive capacity, rapid larval development and hibernation as pupae or adults. We discuss the perspectives and limitations in applying the CNI at both national and local scales. We propose that, when taking the critical nitrogen load of the examined butterfly community into account, the CNI may prove a valuable tool to track changes of biotic communities in relation to nitrogen deposition.

AB  - Objectives: This study examines biological indicators of dental disease and nonspecific stress in human remains of three high altitude Himalayan archaeological sites to test whether shared ecological constraints led to similar bioarchaeological profiles in these markers.
   Methods: Samples (n=170) derive from three sites in Nepal dating to two periods (400-50 BCE and c. 400-650 CE). Dental diseases (caries, antemortem tooth loss, and abscesses) were assessed by both the number of individuals and the number of elements observed, while childhood stress markers included observation of growth disruptions (enamel hypoplasia and adult femur length/stature) and cranial porosities. Statistical analysis included chi-square and Fisher's exact tests for categorical data and ANOVA and t-tests for metric data.
   Results: There are significant differences between the sites and sexes in frequencies of dental diseases in the adult samples. There are low frequencies of childhood stress markers overall and the femur length data show no significant differences across sites, but significant sexual dimorphism within each site. Females have reduced stature compared to contemporary Tibetan samples residing at a similar elevation.
   Conclusions: Variations in dental disease frequencies between the sites may be due to local variations in microenvironment, cultural, and/or temporal differences in resource availability, food consumption and preparation, as well as the age structure of the samples. The low frequencies of markers for nonspecific stress may be indicative of the ability of these ancient Himalayan groups to successfully meet the challenges posed by the extreme conditions of high altitude living through biocultural adaptations.

AB  - Numerous river restoration projects have been undertaken to improve the hydromorphology of rivers and their floodplains. Subsequent ecological monitoring is usually restricted to instream quality assessment, but riparian areas and floodplains are rarely assessed. A good indicator for riparian assessment could be vegetation as its diversity is dependent on functioning hydromorphological processes. We used a comparative survey to test the effect of newly created river morphological features on riparian plant composition at restored reaches relative to nonrestored reaches. We investigated 43 larger river restoration projects in Western Germany, realized between 1987 and 2008. The vegetation surveys were conducted between 2005 and 2013. We hypothesized that (a) morphological river restoration leads to the diversification of riparian vegetation, higher reach-scale habitat heterogeneity, and optimized habitats. These changes will (b) be reflected by ecological preferences indicating hydromorphological functioning. We detected significantly higher species diversity in restored reaches. New habitats and hydrological interactions in the active channel and with the floodplains were fundamental, with the latter indicated by species preferences. In restored reaches, we observed higher percentages of plants indicating regular flooding, significantly higher mean moisture tolerances, and an extended range of moisture preferences. Morphological river restoration can diversify and fundamentally influence riparian vegetation. Ecologically meaningful projects should address the rehabilitation of abiotic processes, focusing on a functioning flooding regime and near-natural riparian habitats. Riparian vegetation will reflect the improvements and consequently could be used as an indicator for restoration efforts. Thus, riparian vegetation assessment is worthy of consideration through legal obligations.

AB  - Strategy development for Integrated Pest Management (IPM) requires suitable environmental risk assessment to upscale risks based on environmental parameters, pesticide properties, multi-exposures toxicity assessments and field-specific information on pesticide usage on landscape level. This paper introduces the easy-to-use environmental risk assessment tool SYNOPS-WEB to assess acute and chronic pesticide risks to soil, surface water and pollinators, as well as via leaching to groundwater. SYNOPS-WEB is a free-to-use online tool available for advisors and policy makers within the European Union to compare and assess pesticide risk under realistic application patterns and environmental-conditions. The proposed methodology and structure of SYNOPS-WEB are described along with brief usage instructions. Model predictions for aquatic exposure assessment were evaluated on a four-year pesticide monitoring dataset from a small agricultural catchment. SYNOPS-WEB reliably modelled the aquatic exposure of pesticides detected during monitoring and additionally revealed risks from pesticides that could not be detected in surface water due to their high toxicity at concentrations close to the limit of quantification. Further evaluation of the tool is needed to assess model outputs concerning exposure assessment for soil, groundwater and field margin biotopes. Overall, SYNOPS-WEB has the potential to provide relevant information to European farmers, authorities and agronomists for developing and optimizing IPM strategies with particular focus on minimizing environmental risks. The structure of the model allows for future adaption and integration of novel approaches to risk assessment for a wider range of reference organisms and a larger set of mitigation measures.

AB  - City ponds have the potential to harbour a rich biodiversity of aquatic insects despite being located in an urban landscape. However, our current knowledge on the correlates of pond biodiversity is limited and even less is known about the factors that influence the ecological uniqueness of urban ponds. The multiple environmental gradients, at different spatial scales, that may affect biodiversity and ecological uniqueness of urban ponds can thus be seen both as an opportunity and as a challenge for a study. In this study, we aimed to fill this gap by focusing on aquatic insect assemblages in 51 ponds in the Swedish city of Stockholm, using a metacommunity perspective. We found that species richness was primarily determined by the density of aquatic insects, water depth and proportion of buildings around the pond. The uniqueness of ponds was estimated as local contributions to beta diversity (LCBD), and it was primarily related to the proportion of arable land and industry around the ponds. With regard to the metacommunity we found two interesting patterns. First, there was a negative relationship between richness and LCBD. Second, biodiversity was spatially independent, suggesting that spatially-patterned dispersal did not structure species richness or LCBD. These last two patterns are important when considering conservation efforts of biodiversity in city ponds. We hence suggest that the conservation of insect biodiversity in urban pond should consider the surroundings of the ponds, and that high-richness ponds are not necessarily those that require most attention because they are not ecologically the most unique.

AB  - Drought decreased the optimal temperature for photosynthesis and significantly reduced carbon fixation of Moso bamboo forest. VPD is a superior indicator for simulating the response of GPP to drought.
   The severity and frequency of drought in the subtropics and tropical marginal convective zones are increasing and consequently greater attention is being given to the effects of drought on the carbon balance of forest ecosystems. Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis (CarriSre) J.Houz.) is an important economic forest type in China that is vulnerable to drought. Using an eddy covariance technique and model simulation, this study analyzed the responses of the carbon fluxes of Moso bamboo to environmental factors during a drought. It was found that temperature had a restricting effect on photosynthesis, and that the optimal temperature for photosynthesis was left-shifted, indicating that drought decreased the optimal temperature for photosynthesis and changed the response of gross primary productivity (GPP) to temperature. In comparison with other environmental factors, the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was established as a much better indicator for simulating the response of GPP to drought. By including the VPD limitation of GPP in the eddy covariance light use efficiency model, it was found that the model could explain the response of GPP to drought well, reducing the uncertainty in GPP (e.g., the overestimation of GPP under drought-stress conditions). A dynamic linear regression showed drought decreased carbon fixation by roughly 12.7 % of GPP and 44.8 % of the net ecosystem CO2 exchange, but it had no obvious influence on ecosystem respiration.

AB  - Development of methods for assessing exposure and effects of waterborne toxicants on stream invertebrate species is important to elucidate environmentally relevant information. Current protocols for freshwater invertebrate toxicity testing almost exclusively utilize cladocerans, amphipods or chironomids rather than the more typical aquatic insect taxa found in lotic systems. Centroptilum triangulifer is a parthenogenetic mayfly occurring in depositional habitats of streams and rivers of the Eastern U.S. and Canada. C. triangulifer is an ideal stream insect for toxicity testing under field and laboratory conditions because of its short life cycle, parthenogenetic mode of reproduction, and it represents a group considered sensitive to environmental stressors. In this study, a colony of C triangulifer was reared using a defined diet of three diatoms, Mayamaea atomus var. permitis, Nitzschia cf. pusilla, and Achnanthidium minutissimum. Percent survival (>= 80%), fecundity measurements (>= 1000 eggs) and pre-egg laying weights were used as indicators of overall colony health and fitness in our laboratory water (Lab-line) and in Moderately Hard Reconstituted Water (MHRW). Lab-line reared C. triangulifer had average survival rate of 92.69% for eleven generations and 82.99% over thirteen generations. MHRW reared C triangulifer had an average survival rate of 80.65% for four generations and three generations of fecundities greater than 1000 eggs per individual. Pre-egg laying weight and fecundity were highly correlated and a best-fit model equation was derived to estimate egg counts for future generations. Establishment of this culturing protocol provides a more ecologically relevant species for toxicity testing and aids in further stressor identification for stream bioassessments.

AB  - Current estimates of diversifying positive selection rely on first having an accurate multiple sequence alignment. Simulation studies have shown that under biologically plausible conditions, relying on a single estimate of the alignment from commonly used alignment software can lead to unacceptably high false-positive rates in detecting diversifying positive selection. We present a novel statistical method that eliminates excess false positives resulting from alignment error by jointly estimating the degree of positive selection and the alignment under an evolutionary model. Our model treats both substitutions and insertions/deletions as sequence changes on a tree and allows site heterogeneity in the substitution process. We conduct inference starting from unaligned sequence data by integrating over all alignments. This approach naturally accounts for ambiguous alignments without requiring ambiguously aligned sites to be identified and removed prior to analysis. We take a Bayesian approach and conduct inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo to integrate over all alignments on a fixed evolutionary tree topology. We introduce a Bayesian version of the branch-site test and assess the evidence for positive selection using Bayes factors. We compare two models of differing dimensionality using a simple alternative to reversible-jump methods. We also describe a more accurate method of estimating the Bayes factor using Rao-Blackwellization. We then show using simulated data that jointly estimating the alignment and the presence of positive selection solves the problem with excessive false positives from erroneous alignments and has nearly the same power to detect positive selection as when the true alignment is known. We also show that samples taken from the posterior alignment distribution using the software have substantially lower alignment error compared with , , , and alignments.

AB  - Ichthyoplankton is an essential component of pelagic ecosystems, and environmental factors play an important role in determining its distribution. We have investigated simultaneous latitudinal and cross-shelf gradients in ichthyoplankton abundance to test the hypothesis that the large-scale distribution of fish larvae in the South Brazil Shelf is associated with water mass composition. Vertical plankton tows were collected between 21 degrees 27' and 34 degrees 51'S at 107 stations, in austral late spring and early summer seasons. Samples were taken with a conical-cylindrical plankton net from the depth of chlorophyll maxima to the surface in deep stations, or from 10 m from the bottom to the surface in shallow waters. Salinity and temperature were obtained with a CTD/rosette system, which provided seawater for chlorophyll-a and nutrient concentrations. The influence of water mass on larval fish species was studied using Indicator Species Analysis, whereas environmental effects on the distribution of larval fish species were analyzed by Distance-based Redundancy Analysis. Larval fish species were associated with specific water masses: in the north, Sardinella brasiliensis was found in Shelf Water; whereas in the south, Engraulis anchoita inhabited the Plata Plume Water. At the slope, Tropical Water was characterized by the bristlemouth Cyclothone acclinidens. The concurrent analysis showed the importance of both cross-shelf and latitudinal gradients on the large-scale distribution of larval fish species. Our findings reveal that ichthyoplankton composition and large-scale spatial distribution are determined by water mass composition in both latitudinal and cross-shelf gradients.

AB  - Plants affect soil conditions, which in turn alter plant growth and interspecific competition, forming plant-soil feedback (PSF) systems. PSF is a good example of bidirectional interactions between biomes and the non-living environments, acting as a major driving force of community structure and ecosystem function. Among the major types of PSF mediated by various soil components, there are many holes in our knowledge of the interactions between PSF mediated by plant species-specific litter and PSF mediated by soil microbes. Here I discuss the role of the functional diversity of microbial decomposers in litter-mediated PSF and also propose new hypotheses on the role of microbial diversity in PSF mediated by pathogenic and mutualistic soil microbes. I also review how PSF interacts with human-induced environmental change, i.e., direct drivers of change in the ecosystem (e.g. climate change and the invasion of alien species). Many authors have suggested that the impact of alien plant species on ecosystems is mediated by PSF, which also interacts with other direct drivers, such as climate change. Using a simple model of litter-mediated PSF with microbial decomposers, I confirm that the interactions between PSF and other direct drivers affect the invasion process of alien species. The model also demonstrates that the functional diversity of microbial decomposers accelerates or decelerates the speed of the invasion depending on the environmental change scenarios. Further theoretical and empirical studies are needed to derive general predictions on how exogenous environmental change induced by human activities alters communities and ecosystems through disturbance or modification of endogenous community-ecosystem interactions, such as the functioning of PSF.

AB  - To maximise the long-term use of limited ecosystem services in South Africa, managers continually require approaches to optimise the establishment of balances between the use and protection of ecosystems to ensure sustainability. Surface freshwater aquatic ecosystems are dynamic and difficult to manage effectively. Sound management protocols that can identify and rank threats to these ecosystems are urgently required. The Regional-Scale Risk Assessment approach is carried out on a spatial scale and allows for the consideration of multiple sources of multiple stressors affecting multiple endpoints, with the inclusion of local ecosystem dynamics and the characteristics of the landscape that may affect the risk estimate. This paper presents an integrated approach to carry out regional-scale ecological risk assessments using a Relative Risk Model (RRM) adapted for South African conditions. The RRM consists of 10 procedural steps that are relatively easily applied. The use and application of the RRM within South Africa has the potential to provide resource users, resource conservators and regulators of surface aquatic ecosystems with a range of benefits. These benefits include the establishment of a validated, structured methodology that is sensitive to the dynamics of individual case studies, extremely informative, locally applicable and internationally comparable with other RRM assessments. The use of the RRM approach in South Africa has many advantages that outweigh some disadvantages. This approach has the potential to substantially contribute towards the ease and effectiveness of management of the balance between the use and protection of aquatic ecosystems in South Africa.

AB  - A substantial part of current research efforts on desertification are devoted to establish monitoring systems to evaluate the status of natural resources and the onset of desertification processes. Methodologies based on ground-collected soil and plant indicators are being increasingly used for this aim because they are affordable yet do not compromise accuracy. Despite their inherent value, these methods have limitations regarding the extent of the area that can be monitored using them. Such limitations can be overcome combining field-based approaches with remote sensing data, which allow the establishment of monitoring programs over large areas. In this article we tested the relationship between a field methodology based on indicators of ecosystem functioning, the landscape function analysis (LEA), and a vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from satellite images of the ASTER sensor using data gathered in Stipa tenacissima steppes from central Spain. LFA uses soil surface indicators to assess the condition of a given ecosystem by producing three numerical indices (stability, infiltration and nutrient cycling) reflecting the status of basic soil functions. We found a significant positive linear relationship between the NDVI, the three LFA indices and some key structural attributes of vegetation related to the cover of perennial plants. Our results indicate that NDVI can be used as a surrogate of ecosystem functioning in semi-arid Mediterranean steppes, and thus can be a helpful index to monitor the functional status of large areas in these ecosystems, and the possible onset of desertification processes.

AB  - To enhance understanding of the metabolic indicators of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) disease pathogenesis and progression, the urinary metabolomes of well characterized rhesus macaques (normal or spontaneously and naturally diabetic) were examined. High-resolution ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with the accurate mass determination of time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to analyze spot urine samples from normal (n = 10) and T2DM (n = 11) male monkeys. The machine-learning algorithm random forests classified urine samples as either from normal or T2DM monkeys. The metabolites important for developing the classifier were further examined for their biological significance. Random forests models had a misclassification error of less than 5%. Metabolites were identified based on accurate masses (<10 ppm) and confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry of authentic compounds. Urinary compounds significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the T2DM when compared with the normal group included glycine betaine (9-fold), citric acid (2.8-fold), kynurenic acid (1.8-fold), glucose (68-fold), and pipecolic acid (6.5-fold). When compared with the conventional definition of T2DM, the metabolites were also useful in defining the T2DM condition, and the urinary elevations in glycine betaine and pipecolic acid (as well as proline) indicated defective re-absorption in the kidney proximal tubules by SLC6A20, a Na+-dependent transporter. The mRNA levels of SLC6A20 were significantly reduced in the kidneys of monkeys with T2DM. These observations were validated in the db/db mouse model of T2DM. This study provides convincing evidence of the power of metabolomics for identifying functional changes at many levels in the omics pipeline.

AB  - The fish community on the Atlantic deep continental shelf and upper slope to the northwest of Scotland has been the subject of biological studies for more than a century, and subject to bottom-trawl fishing for around 25 years. In this work, we examine trends in biodiversity of the deep-water demersal fish community revealed by a decade of trawl surveys by Marine Scotland-Science. The composition and structure of the fish assemblage was described using species richness as well as the descriptors of community interrelatedness: taxonomic diversity (Delta) and taxonomic distinctness (Delta*). Results revealed no temporal trends in community composition. The most significant factor in determining richness and taxonomic diversity of the demersal fish fauna was depth, and to a lesser extent latitude. Diversity and distinctness decreased with increasing depth and showed a complex relationship with latitude, while richness peaked at depths around 1400 m. This study shows taxonomic measures of diversity and distinctness to be sensitive indicators of ecological conditions in the deep-water fish community, with respect to depth and latitude, and the fact that no temporal trends were detected suggests that the structure of the fish community at exploitable depths on the Scottish slope has remained stable over the period 1998-2008. These findings imply that care should be taken when planning spatial measures designed to safeguard deep-water fish biodiversity because the optimal area recommended for protection is strongly dependent on the choice of metric used.

AB  - The paper proposes a methodology of phytogeographical regionalisation using grassland vegetation data. The research area is located in the West Carpathians, in volcanic field with adjacent post-tectonic basins and valleys in the Central Slovakia. The applied techniques were variogram modelling, ordinary kriging and lattice wombling. Phi coefficient was used to determine the diagnostic species of proposed phytochoria (fidelity test). The 1978 unevenly distributed grassland polygons that comprised 1071 taxa of vascular plants were the subject of the analyses. Ecological indicator values for temperature (EITs), weighted by species coverage in the Tansley scale in each grassland polygon, were used for the modelling. The gradients in the surface of the indicator value produced by ordinary kriging were analyzed. The steepest gradients indicate the most radical changes in floristic composition typical of border locations.
   The steepest gradient divides the study area into main cold and main warm regions. Less intensive gradients determined the position of 15 subdistricts. Subsequently, 7 out of 15 subdistricts were merged on the basis of similar natural conditions and floristic composition into 3 districts.
   Ten, mostly thermophilous, diagnostic species were determined for the main warm region. Fourteen, mostly psychrophilous, diagnostic species were determined for the main cold region. Subsequently, diagnostic species were determined for districts. High number of diagnostic species (57) characterize the Pol'ana Mts district. Eleven diagnostic species were determined for the Zvolenska kotlina basin district. The Javorie and OstrA3/4y Mts district was very poorly diferentiated with 3 diagnostic species.
   Such evaluation suggests that proposed methodology allowed for the identification of phytochoria with specific floristic composition. The obtained results are discussed.

AB  - The rotifer community structure may be shaped by a variety of environmental factors, including biological parameters, such as predation or competition, as well as by physical-chemical factors, among which the kind of macrophyte substratum and parameters relating to the trophic state and to the catchment area conditions are of great importance. Another impact on rotifer composition, abundance and frequency may be expected when considering differentiated macrophyte types (including helophytes, nymphaeids and elodeids) within a group of eight ponds located within a mid-forest catchment area, which was the main aim of the present study. Detailed analysis on the participation of indicator eutrophic rotifer species provided an additional goal of this investigation in order to qualify the trophic state of this kind of water body located within the Wielkopolska region, in the central western part of Poland.
   The presence of 117 taxa, including 7 species that are rare or infrequently distributed in the Polish fauna was recorded. The number of taxa and rotifer abundance differed greatly in respect to the specific water body and to the type of substratum. The vegetated zones dominated by elodeids were characterised by the most various and most abundant rotifer communities as well as by the highest values of the Shannon-Weaver index. This reflects a positive relationship between the heterogeneity of habitat and the structure of rotifer communities. It was also found that helophytes and the open water zone possessed the highest, while elodeids the lowest percentage of eutrophic species.

AB  - We examine the advantages and disadvantages of a methodological framework designed to analyze the poorly understood relationships between the ecosystem properties of large portions of land, and their capacities (stocks) to provide goods and services (flows). These capacities (stocks) are referred to as landscape functions. The core of our assessment is a set of expert- and literature-driven binary links, expressing whether specific land uses or other environmental properties have a supportive or neutral role for given landscape functions. The binary links were applied to the environmental properties of 581 administrative units of Europe with widely differing environmental conditions and this resulted in a spatially explicit landscape function assessment. To check under what circumstances the binary links are able to replace complex interrelations, we compared the landscape function maps with independently generated continent-wide assessments (maps of ecosystem services or environmental parameters/indicators). This rigorous testing revealed that for 9 out of 15 functions the straightforward binary links work satisfactorily and generate plausible geographical patterns. This conclusion holds primarily for production functions. The sensitivity of the nine landscape functions to changes in land use was assessed with four land use scenarios (IPCC SRES). It was found that most European regions maintain their capacity to provide the selected services under any of the four scenarios, although in some cases at other locations within the region. At the proposed continental scale, the selected input parameters are thus valid proxies which can be used to assess the mid-term potential of landscapes to provide goods and services.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation results in new environmental conditions that may stress resident populations. Such stress may be reflected in demographical or morphological changes in the individuals inhabiting those landscapes. This Study evaluates the effects of fragmentation of the Maulino forest on population density, sex ratio, body size, and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of the endemic carabid Ceroglossus chilensis. Individuals of C chilensis were collected during 2006 in five locations at Los Queules National Reserve (continuous forest), in five forest fragments and in five areas of surrounding pine plantations (matrix). In each location, once a season, 40 pitfall traps (20 in the centre, 20 in the edge), were opened for 72 h. Population density of C. chilensis was higher in the small fragments than in the pine matrix, with intermediate densities in the continuous forest; sex ratio did not differ significantly from 1: 1 in the three habitats. Individuals from the centre of fragments were smaller than those from the centre of continuous forest, and FA did not vary significantly among habitats. These results suggest that small forest fragments maintain dense populations of C chilensis and therefore they must be considered in conservation strategies. Although the decrease of the body size suggests that small remnants should be connected by managing the structure of the surrounding matrix, facilitating the dispersion of this carabid across the landscape and avoiding possible antagonistic interactions inside small fragments.

AB  - A project to restore a degraded area must Firstly reestablish organic soil matter and nutrient cycling process. In order to evaluate the influence of indigenous tree plantations on changings in soil fertility and organic matter dynamics, an experiment was installed at the Poco das Antas Biological Reserve, an Atlantic Rain Forest remnant of ca. 5,200. Six treatments involved mature forests (F), 8-year-old mixed plantations of indigenous tree species (P), and abandoned pastures (G), at both the flooding (V) and the sloping (M) areas of the Reserve. The experimental design was completely randomized. Soil samples were collected at the layers 0-2.5cm; 2-5-7.5cm; and 7.5-20cm to evaluate soil pH, and Al, Ca+Mg, P, K, C and N contents. The PV treatment showed higher values for the exchangeable cations, C and soil organic matter (SOM) contents, indicating high cycling rates and biological activity. Sol] stability was considered to be high in all treatments, since C:N ratio was lower than 12: 1. Organic matter fragmentation showed a higher amount of fulvic acids (FA), humic acids (HA) and humin (HU) in the PV treatment, for the three soil layers. The plantation on the sloping areas (PM) showed the highest values of (FA+HA)/HU ratio, Suggesting a lower stability condition.Results suggest indigenous tree plantations have great potential to restore nutrient cycling and soil organic matter contents in short term period in areas where forests have been converted into pastures. Techniques to accelerate the development of trees plantation on the sloping areas must be adopted.

AB  - The proclamation of the "Soil of the Year" was made for the first time in Germany in 2005 on occasion of the World Soil Day. Chernozems were selected for this purpose. In this paper an overview of these groups of soils is given. Chernozems are concentrated in the drought region of Central Germany. A standard profile from the core area of Chernozems developed from loess is presented with comprehensive laboratory analysis. Chernozems developed primarily upon carbonatic loess substrates under summer-dry climatic conditions in an open park-like landscape with isolated forest stands. The development of Chernozems began as early as the late glacial period, and they were fully developed by the Atlantikum age. The far-reaching, uniformly thick humus horizons indicate substrate differences in the loess cover, which are partly the result of bioturbation. Within Germany, Chernozems and Chernozem-like soils make up approx. 3% of the surface area and 5% (approx. 11,000 km(2)) of the arable land. The results of the Static Fertilization Experiment in Bad Lauchstadt, founded in 1902, clarify the high value of Chernozem for biomass production and the environment. Each loss due to erosion or decrease in surface area reduces the fulfillment of soil ecological functions of the soils and is comparable to a loss of animal and plant species. Therefore, soil scientists and the results of soil research must be more comprehensively implemented for soil preservation, protection, and politics. For acceptance of these goals among the general public and the political-decision makers, the campaign "Soil of the Year" should give some thought-provoking impulses.

AB  - There is significant interest in studying stem cells, both to elucidate their basic biological functions during development and adulthood as well as to learn how to utilize them as new sources of specialized cells for tissue repair. Whether the motivation is basic biology or biomedical application, however, progress will hinge upon learning how to better control stem-cell function at a quantitative and molecular level. There are several major challenges within the field, including the identification of new signals and conditions that regulate and influence cell function, and the application of this information towards the design of stem-cell bioprocesses and therapies. Both of these efforts can significantly benefit from the synthesis of biological data into quantitative and increasingly mechanistic models that not only describe, but also predict, how a stem cell's environment can control its fate. This review will briefly summarize the history and current state of the stem-cell biology field, but will then focus on the development of predictive models for stem-cell control. Early models formulated on the assumption that cell fate was decided by stochastic, cell-intrinsic processes have gradually evolved into hybrid deterministic-stochastic models with increasingly finer molecular resolution that accounts for environmental regulation. As our understanding of cellular control mechanisms expands from the cell surface and towards the nucleus, these efforts may culminate in the development of a stem-cell culture programme, or a series of signals to provide to the cells as a function of time to guide them along a desired developmental trajectory.

AB  - The partitioning of gamma diversity into its alpha and beta components has been used to quantify the effects of natural habitat reduction on species diversity and distribution. Ant assemblages respond to anthropogenic changes, allowing their use as an indicator of biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes. We investigated the responses of gamma, alpha, and beta diversity of ant assemblages to a forest cover gradient in southwestern Brazilian Amazon. Our prediction was that increasing forest cover would increase gamma diversity, which in turn is driven more by increasing beta diversity than alpha diversity along the forest cover gradient. Additionally, we expected that increasing beta diversity would be mainly driven by species replacement. We sampled ants within 12 circular areas (radius: 500 m) with different forest cover percentages in Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve, state of Acre, southwestern Brazilian Amazon. Gamma and beta diversity, but not alpha diversity, responded positively to the forest cover gradient. Additionally, species replacement was the main driver of beta diversity along the forest cover gradient. Areas with low levels of forest cover probably offer limited variation in habitats, resources, and conditions and, thus, harbor a low number of ant species that can easily disperse spatially and leading to species composition simplification. We recommend the use of diversity partitioning for indicator groups as an efficient way to monitor biodiversity and control the process of biota simplification at the human-modified landscapes, showing the response of species diversity and distribution to human impacts. Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material.

AB  - Context Seed dispersal by birds plays a crucial role in structuring landscape dynamics. The dispersal process has been extensively studied at local scales; however, landscape scale approaches are scarce. The wide availability of bird species distribution data can be used to explore plant dispersal processes at large spatial scales. Objective We investigated whether and at which scale bird-seed-dispersal indicators (BSDI) based on species distribution models (SDMs), together with climatic and landscape structure metrics related to habitat preferences of birds, aid the explanation of the distribution of Viscum album. Methods We developed a set of BSDI (abundance, species richness, Turdus spp. richness, and specialization) at four different scales (500-3500 m). They served as predictors, along with other environmental variables, in generalized linear models to predict V. album distribution in Catalonia, Spain. Results The indicator Turdus spp. richness (3500 m) explained up to 15% of variance. This contribution was smaller when it was considered alongside other predictors, where climatic conditions and % of olive groves explained ca. 35% and 13% variance, respectively. The abundance or species richness BSDI proved to be poor predictors of V. album distribution. Conclusions We demonstrated the functionality of BSDI based on SDMs to predict the distribution of V. album and the importance to test them at different spatial scales. BSDI showed a clear larger effect with increasing scale, suggesting a strong link between the mobility of birds and the plant dispersal process. The modelling approach could be applied to different localities and species to understand plant seed dispersal at landscape scale.

AB  - This paper makes full use of the advantages of open source software, enhances the advantages of SWMMM model and MapWindow model, and provides ideas and solutions that integrate open source GIS system and professional model software. The basic concepts of SWMMM model and open source GIS system (MapW Indo) are outlined. The GIS platform is the parameter input platform, display platform, and statistical analysis platform of the SWMM model. The SWMM model provides hydropower and water quality modeling modules for the platform. Both data are stored in MongoD B. In addition, the document established a coastline climate environment and ecological environment remote sensing evaluation system as a basis for evaluation based on land use data and 17 types of land use and combined each evaluation result with expert advice and weighted analysis and classification. Each indicator is used to calculate the overall score of each area, as well as the weight and ratio of each factor in each field. With the implementation of Educational Information Action Plan 2.0, the city's modern education and training reforms are gaining momentum. Smart teaching has become the main focus of reform and innovation in universities and cities in the new century. The proficient smart teaching ability of university teachers is the basic condition necessary to create the professional development of English teachers, create smart classrooms and improve the smart city English education evaluation system, develop smart practical teaching, strengthen inter-school exchanges and cooperation, and widely promote smart teaching of urban English.

AB  - Leaf water potential is a critical indicator of plant water status, integrating soil moisture status, plant physiology, and environ-mental conditions. There are few tools for measuring plant water status (water potential) in situ, presenting a critical barrier for developing appropriate phenotyping (measurement) methods for crop development and modeling efforts aimed at understand-ing water transport in plants. Here, we present the develop-ment of an in situ, minimally disruptive hydrogel nanoreporter (AquaDust) for measuring leaf water potential. The gel matrix responds to changes in water potential in its local environment by swelling; the distance between covalently linked dyes changes with the reconfiguration of the polymer, leading to changes in the emission spectrum via F orster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). Upon infiltration into leaves, the nanoparticles localize within the apoplastic space in the mesophyll; they do not enter the cytoplasm or the xylem. We characterize the physical basis for AquaDust's response and demonstrate its function in intact maize (Zea mays L.) leaves as a reporter of leaf water poten-tial. We use AquaDust to measure gradients of water potential along intact, actively transpiring leaves as a function of water status; the localized nature of the reporters allows us to define a hydraulic model that distinguishes resistances inside and outside the xylem. We also present field measurements with AquaDust through a full diurnal cycle to confirm the robustness of the technique and of our model. We conclude that AquaDust offers potential opportunities for high-throughput field measurements and spatially resolved studies of water relations within plant tissues.

AB  - Different organisms (mainly poikilotherms) are subject to environmental fluctuations that could affect their normal physiological functioning (e.g., by destabilization of biomembranes and rupture of biomolecules). As a result, animals regulate their body temperature and adapt to different environmental conditions through various physiological strategies. These adaptations are crucial in all organisms, although they are more relevant in those that have reached a great adaptive diversity such as scorpions. Within scorpions, the genus Urophonius presents species with winter activity, being this a peculiarity within the Order and an opportunity to study the strategies deployed by these organisms when facing different temperatures. Here, we explore three basic issues of lipid remodeling under high and low temperatures, using adults and juveniles of Urophonius achalensis and U. brachycentrus. First, as an indicator of metabolic state, we analyzed the lipidic changes in different tissues observing that low temperatures generate higher quantities of triacylglycerols and fewer amount of structural lipids and sphyngomielin. Furthermore, we studied the participation of fatty acids in adaptive homeoviscosity, showing that there are changes in the quantity of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids at low temperature (mainly 16:0, 18:0, 18:1 and 18:2). Finally, we observe that there are quantitative and qualitative variations in the cuticular hydrocarbons (with possible water barrier and chemical recognition function). These fluctuations are in some cases species-specific, metabolic-specific, tissue-specific and in others depend on the ontogenetic state.

AB  - When wildlife forage and/or live in urban habitats, they often experience a shift in resource availability and dietary quality. Some species even use human handouts, such as bread, as well as human refuse, as a large part of their new diets; yet the influences of this nutritional shift on health and survival remain unclear. American white ibises are increasingly being seen in urban areas in Florida; they collect handouts, such as bread and other food items, from humans in parks, and are also found foraging on anthropogenic sources in trash heaps. We hypothesized that the consumption of these new anthropogenic food sources may trigger increases in indicators of physiological challenge and dampen immune responses. We tested this experimentally by raising 20 white ibis nestlings in captivity, and exposing 10 to a simulated anthropogenic diet (including the addition of white bread and a reduction in seafood content) while maintaining 10 on a diet similar to what ibises consume in more natural environments. We then tested two indicators of physiological challenge (corticosterone and heat shock protein 70), assessed innate immunity in these birds via bactericidal assays and an in vitro carbon clearance assay, and adaptive immunity using a phytohemagglutinin skin test. The anthropogenic diet depressed the development of the ability to killSalmonella paratyphiin culture. Our results suggest that consuming an anthropogenic diet may be detrimental in terms of the ability to battle a pathogenic bacterial species, but there was little effect on indicators of physiological challenge and other immunological measures.

AB  - Urban agriculture (UA) is regarded as an emerging tool and strategy for sustainable urban development as it addresses a wide array of environmental, economic and social objectives. Home gardening represents a common form of UA in the close living environments of urban dwellers that can be particularly important for rapidly growing cities and metropolitan regions in developing and transitional countries. However, a structured conceptual analysis of different urban sustainability benefits, including its operationalisation, is lacking. We therefore investigated whether and to which extent home gardening practices in urban residential environments contribute to urban sustainability. In detail, we analysed the contribution of prevailing cultivation practices, socio-economic situations, motivation, knowledge and networking of individual household and external framework conditions to the environmental, economic and socio-cultural dimensions of urban sustainability. Between January and May 2014, we conducted a questionnaire survey among 111 gardeners in residential neighbourhoods of Pune (India) and applied an analytical framework using composite indicators with index values to the compiled data. Our main results showed that sustainability benefits can be expected especially in environmental and socio-cultural aspects, particularly for urban biodiversity conservation and aesthetic green urban spaces, and less expected in economic contributions and food production. Gardening practice and sustainability contribution is rather determined by the motivation and socio-demographic factors of the gardener than type and size of the garden. We conclude that conserving and building home gardens can contribute to urban sustainability and should therefore be considered in the planning, design and management of urban spaces.

AB  - Groundwater guarantees water resources and ecological environment security in semi-arid areas. Studying the chemical evolution of groundwater in semi-arid areas is of great significance to regional ecological environment protection and water resources management. The water storage basin is not only a space for groundwater storage and movement but also a place for water-rock-gas interaction and elemental migration, dispersion, and enrichment. Due to its unique climate and geological environment, the semi-arid water storage basins have different hydrochemical environments, forming a zonal hydrogeochemical character. In this study, a typical semi-arid water storage basin (west of Jilin Province) is taken as an example, through the cross section of the recharge-runoff-excretion zone. A three-level hydrogeochemical zoning model is constructed to reveal the hydrogeochemical evolution of the area. The model is divided into three layers from bottom to top. The first layer shows the geological and hydrogeological conditions, including the topography, lithology, geological time, and hydrodynamic characteristics of the study area. The second layer represents the hydrogeochemical processes, divided into the recharge zone, runoff zone, and discharge zone in the horizontal direction according to the hydrodynamic environment and hydrochemistry type. The hydrogeochemical action gradually changes from lixiviation to cation exchange, evaporation, and concentration, as the landform plays a key role in hydrochemistry formation in the discharge area. The third layer gives the characteristics of the groundwater chemical components, including chemistry type, total dissolved solids, main anion and cation, and characteristic element F. Qualitative and quantitative characterizations of hydrochemistry evolution by reverse simulation and hydrodynamic, hydrochemical and thermodynamic indicators are given.

AB  - This study aimed to identify indicator species and explore the most important environmental and management variables contributing to vegetation distribution in a hilly upper dam landscape in Zagros Mountain chain, Iran. A stratified random sampling method was used to collect topographic, edaphic, management and vegetation data. The density and cover percentage of perennial species were measured quantitatively. Indicator species were identified using the two-way indicator species analysis. Besides calculating physiognomic factors in sample sites, 24 soil samples were collected from 0 to 30 cm of soil depth and analyzed in terms of gravel percentage, texture, saturation moisture, organic matter, pH and electrical conductivity in saturation extract, lime percentage, soluble calcium and magnesium, available phosphorus, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) and soluble sodium and potassium. Multivariate techniques including Canonical Correspondence Analysis and Multi-Dimensional Scaling were used to explore the relationships of species with environmental and management variables. Seven plants were identified as indicator species due to being significantly correlated with management (grazing or non-grazing) and edaphic variables such as CEC, soil texture, pH, CaCO3 percentage and physiographic variable including slope, elevation, and convex and concave formations (p < 0.05). Overall, overgrazing and its subsequent effects on soil characteristics, loss of vegetation cover and trampling were found as the major causes of deterioration. Sustainable and integrated management practices such as the implementation of appropriate grazing systems were suggested to enhance soil quality and reduce the accelerated erosion in upper dam zones.

AB  - Surface mining is a major driver of land use land cover (LULC) change in many mountainous areas such as the Appalachian region. Typical reclamation practices often result in land cover dominated by grass and shrubs. Assessing ecosystem services that can be obtained from a forest landscape may help policy-makers and other stakeholders fully understand the benefits of forestry-based reclamation (FRA). The objectives of this study are to (1) identify how surface mining and reclamation changed the LULC of a watershed encompassing the north fork of the Kentucky River, (2) assess the biophysical value of four major ecosystem services under the contemporary LULC condition, and (3) assess the benefits of the FRA scenario in the provision of ecosystem services. Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to study the LULC change and InVEST software models for ecosystem services assessment. The results indicate that watershed's forest area has decreased by 7751 hectares from 2001 to 2011 and mining/reclamation activities may have contributed 65% of the overall changes in LULC. Barren and grassland land covers provide less carbon storage, yield more water, and export more sediments and nutrients than forests. At the watershed level, the FRA scenario increased carbon storage (13%) and reduced water yield (5%), sediment export (40%), and nutrient export (7%). The provision of these ecosystem services varies at the subwatershed level, and such spatial heterogeneity is primarily driven by land cover composition, precipitation, and topography. This study provides critical information regarding the ecological benefits of restoring mined land to assist policy and decision making at landscape scales.

AB  - Biological invasions provide a unique opportunity to gain insight into basic biological processes occurring under new circumstances. During the process of establishment, exotic species are exposed to various stressors which may affect their development. Presence of the stressors is often detected by measurements of left-right body asymmetry, which consists of two main components: fluctuating asymmetry and directional asymmetry. Fluctuating asymmetry constitutes random differences between the two body sides, whereas directional asymmetry occurs when a particular trait is bigger on one of the sides. The relation between these two asymmetry components is still not fully understood. Our goal was to investigate the potential differences in asymmetry patterns between native and invasive populations of Tetropium fuscum (Fabr. 1787) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), a harmful forest pest native to Europe and introduced to North America. Wing asymmetry assessment was based on the geometric morphometrics of hind wings. We found that specimens from invaded area were markedly smaller and have more asymmetric wings than individuals from native population, suggesting some unfavorable conditions in the invaded area. Moreover, we found significant directional asymmetry in the native but not in the invasive population. On the other hand, differences between left and right hind wings were similar in the native and invasive populations, in terms of direction.This suggests that a high level of fluctuating asymmetry in the invasive population may blur the intrinsic directional asymmetry and hinder its detection. Our data show that fluctuating asymmetry has a potential as an indicator of developmental stress in invasive species.

AB  - With cities growing at a rapid pace, animal species must either retreat to patches of intact natural habitat or adapt to novel conditions in urban areas. While this disturbance causes most species to be in local decline, some show specific behavioural plasticity, facilitating success in a new habitat. The Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) is a common small mammal species which occurs in high numbers in urban environments. To determine which characteristics enable its success, we investigated space use and activity budgets of seven free-ranging individuals living in semi-natural and urban habitats within a large city. We did not find significant differences in animals' space use between habitat types but tendencies towards smaller home ranges and increased home range overlap existed among individuals in the urban site. Squirrels differed between sites in both overall activity levels and temporal activity patterns: urban animals spent less time active and activity onset was later compared to semi-natural conspecifics. This is likely explained by a combination of dense and reliable supplementary food sources in the urban habitat, reducing foraging effort, and restrictions to movement imposed by higher fragmentation. Flexibility in space use and activity budgets, as well as the ability to exploit anthropogenic food sources and tolerate reduced habitat connectivity, are likely the most important factors contributing to the squirrels' success in cities. Accordingly, these traits could be used as indicators of low sensitivity towards urbanisation when assessing other species' potential resilience. However, they do not immunise squirrels against extirpation. Further research on individuals' foraging ecology and population health may reveal possible threats to urban red squirrels and help predict their future persistence in this challenging habitat.

AB  - Urbanized areas with high habitat heterogeneity and intense human impact form unique environment which is surprisingly rich in plant species. We explore the effect of the settlement size on plant species richness, composition and temperature requirements of plant communities.
   We studied three habitats with different disturbance regime in 45 Central European settlements of three different sizes. We sampled 1-ha plots in each habitat by recording all spontaneously occurring vascular plant species. We divided recorded species into groups according to their origin and residence time and according to their temperature requirements based on Ellenberg indicator values. We used ordination methods and ANOVA to detect that species communities in urban areas are generally more species rich in larger settlements than in small ones. These differences are mostly pronounced in residential areas. Increasing settlement size is significantly reflected by neophytes that are dependent on constant input of propagules caused by human activities and by native species that survive in remnants of semi-natural vegetation in urban environment. In contrast archaeophytes as a homogeneous group of species with similar traits are widespread equally through settlements of all sizes. We did not confirm the effect of urban heat island on species composition, indicating that species composition is significantly more affected by local habitat conditions than by urban size. Our results highlight the importance of urban size as important factor shaping biodiversity of native and alien plant communities in individual urban habitats and the important role of habitat mosaic for maintaining high species richness in city floras.

AB  - The response of soil organic matter (SOM) to an abrupt change in environment and management was studied in a long-term field bioassay. Thirty-six soils, with a wide range of SOM reflecting large differences in management, climate, and ecological histories, were selected and transported to a common site at Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. The experiment included control and N-fertilized treatment plots. The plots were seeded annually to spring wheat and managed under no-till rain-fed conditions, with annual removal of aboveground residues. The soils were sampled every 7 yr and analyzed for organic C (OC), total N (TN), and light fraction C (LF-C) and N (LF-N). Most of the soils lost OC and TN over 21 yr, and the amount of loss was highly related to the original contents (9-74 g C kg(-1), 1.4-6.4 g N kg(-1)). Similarly, LF-C and LF-N, indices of labile OM, declined in most soils, but the rate of loss was faster than for OC. In a few soils, SOM slowly increased from initially low levels. The soils seem to be progressing toward a steady state, although complete convergence of OC and TN may not occur for a century or longer based on an exponential model. Labile OM may converge within a few decades, so that these soils, conceivably, will still have widely different OC and TN but similar labile SOM, with possible implications for soil health. Our findings demonstrate the value of long-term field bioassays for improved understanding of SOM dynamics in response to management and climate change.

AB  - Development of nickel mining activities along the New Caledonia coasts threatens the biodiversity of coral reefs. Although the validation of tropical marine organisms as bioindicators of metal mining contamination has received much attention in the literature over the last decade, few studies have examined the potential of corals, the fundamental organisms of coral reefs, to monitor nickel (Ni) contamination in tropical marine ecosystems. In an effort to bridge this gap, the present work investigated the bioaccumulation of Ni-63 in the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata and in its isolated zooxanthellae Symbiodinium, using radiotracer techniques. Results highlight the high capacities of coral tissues (zooxanthellae and host tissues) to efficiently bioconcentrate Ni-63 compared to skeleton (Concentration Factors -CF- at 14 days of exposure are 3 orders of magnitude higher in tissues than in skeleton). When non-contaminated conditions were restored, Ni-63 was more efficiently retained in skeleton than in coral tissues, with biological half-lives (Tb-1/2) of 44.3 and 6.5 days, respectively. In addition, our work showed that Symbiodinium bioconcentrated Ni-63 exponentially, with a vol/vol concentration factor at steady state (VCFSS) reaching 14,056. However, compilation of our results highlighted that despite efficient bioconcentration of Ni-63 in Symbiodinium, their contribution to the whole Ni-63 accumulation in coral nubbins represents less than 7%, suggesting that other biologically controlled processes occur in coral host allowing such efficient bioconcentration in coral tissues.

AB  - Human influence on the environment differs in terms of distribution and intensity, thus producing a gradient of landscape modifications that translates into different landscape structures. Within this variety of landscapes, fringe areas represent complex spaces where dynamic processes and instable conditions can be observed. In this research Kernel Density Estimation, multivariate spatial analysis, landscape pattern analysis, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were combined to model and characterise landscape gradients, and to analyse the structural features of fringe areas. This methodology was applied to a rural area of central Italy, using density indicators associated with urbanisation, agriculture, and natural elements considered to be key components for the identification of landscape gradients. The results highlight not only specific "pillar" landscapes, which are dominated by said components, but also transitional landscapes, where the most relevant forms of interaction between land uses were identified. Characterisation of landscape structures along the gradient illustrated different trends in patch density, shape complexity and landscape diversity, demonstrating greater variability in fringe areas than in pillar landscapes. PCA revealed a partial overlap between the main structural characteristics of the agro-forestry matrix and the medium intensity agricultural landscapes, whereas urban fringes and semi-natural fringes were clearly separated. The discovery of the continuous landscape gradients and an understanding of the gamut of landscape types nested along them is crucial in allowing for more effective land-use planning in which also fringe areas become a relevant part of the process.

AB  - The green leaf area index (LAI) is an important indicator of the photosynthetic capacity of turfgrass canopies. The measurement of LAI is typically destructive and requires large plots to allow for multiple sampling dates. Hyperspectral radiometry may provide a rapid, non-destructive means for estimating LAI. Our objectives were to: (1) evaluate the utility of hyperspectral radiometry to predict the LAI of Kentucky bluegrass (Poa Pratensis L.); and (2) determine regions of the spectrum that provide the best LAI predictions. An empirical prediction model of spectral data for LAI was conducted with partial least squares regression (PLSR). The PLSR method created viable, first-iteration models for five of 11 sampling dates (the coefficient of determination (R-2) is 0.52-0.85). Each model had its own set of factors that were analysed to determine their 'weights', or specific regions of the spectrum by which they were most strongly influenced. Second iterations of each model were then created using only those regions most strongly influenced, centred on 600, 690, 761, 960, 1330, and 1420 nm (+/- 10 nm). Four of the five second-iteration models had LAI estimation capabilities greater than or similar to the first-iteration models (R-2 = 0.72-0.86), indicating that the information contained in all other wavelengths was redundant or irrelevant in regard to predictions of LAI. The robustness of prediction models varied over the growing season, possibly related to changes in canopy properties with environmental conditions. Results suggest hyperspectral radiometry has a significant potential to predict LAI in turfgrass, although different models may be required throughout the growing season.

AB  - Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) is a disease of viral etiology that affects humans causing severe acute respiratory symptoms. In Patagonia the disease is caused by the Andes Virus (AND) and transmitted by the rodent Oligoryzomys longicaudatus. The aim of this study was to identify those human activities that increase the risk of exposure to rodents, what we call "contagious scenarios". A retrospective study was performed with data obtained from cases in Rio Negro, which included clinic-epidemiological records and ecological/environmental assessment reports. The following variables were considered: age, sex, season, percentage of urbanization, geographic location, human settlements in rodent infested areas, probable source of exposure, type of activity and level of sanitary development. In total 32 cases were studied. Exposure was verified in 18 (56.2%) cases in rural areas and 10 cases (31.3%) in small rural towns. In relation to anthropogenic environment, 24 (75%) cases were reported in developed settlements and 8 cases (25%) were related to slightly modified areas. Major exposition in El Bolson identified 8 cases of indoor activities of the total 18 reported in the area (44.5%), while in Bariloche 8 (57.1%) cases out of 14 were reported in outdoor surroundings. In general, activities that generated greater risk were work-related, accounting for 23 (71.9%) cases while 7 were related to recreational activities (28.1%). The identification of "contagious scenarios" at local level provided information for an effective application of available resources in terms of prevention and sanitary education.

AB  - High-precision geochronology provides unprecedented insights into the depositional history of the Upper Triassic Chinle Formation of the Colorado Plateau, as well as its paleoenvironmental and paleobiological records. The Chinle succession exposed in the Petrified Forest National Park (PEFO) and vicinity, Arizona, includes two large-scale alluvial composite sequences. Although each composite sequence fines upward, the upper composite sequence is more dominated by coarser-grained deposits. Petrographic analysis of sandstone lithic content indicates an upward decrease in the proportion of volcanic rock fragments in each composite sequence. Paleocurrent indicators in the lower composite sequence suggest a variable paleoflow direction, whereas northward paleoflow dominated the upper composite sequence. The change in paleoflow appears to coincide with a reorganization of alluvial depositional processes and associated source terranes, and precedes a rapid acceleration in basin subsidence.
   Climate proxy records from paleosol geochemistry indicate a gradual shift from humid to dry conditions across the transition between the lower and upper composite sequences and the Adamanian-Revueltian biotic turnover. Composite-sequence depositional reorganization, climatic shift and biologic turnover, in turn, appear to coincide with episodes of magmatism recorded in Triassic granitoid plutons presently exposed in southern California. Taken collectively, these observations suggest that the Late Triassic depositional, climatic, and ecologic history at PEFO may be related to emergence of the incipient Cordilleran magmatic arc along the convergent western margin of Pangea. A new U-Pb date for the lower part of the Chinle Formation suggests that most or all of the formation was deposited in the Norian Stage.

AB  - Climate-mediated shifts in species' phenologies are expected to alter species interactions, but predicting the consequences of this is difficult because phenological shifts may be driven by different climate factors that may or may not be correlated. Temperature could be an important factor determining effects of phenological shifts by altering species' growth rates and thereby the relative size ratios of interacting species. We tested this hypothesis by independently manipulating temperature and the relative hatching phenologies of two competing amphibian species. Relative shifts in hatching time generally altered the strength of competition, but the presence and magnitude of this effect was temperature dependent and joint effects of temperature and hatching phenology were non-additive. Species that hatched relatively early or late performed significantly better or worse, respectively, but only at higher temperatures and not at lower temperatures. As a consequence, climate-mediated shifts in hatching phenology or temperature resulted in stronger or weaker effects than expected when both factors acted in concert. Furthermore, consequences of phenological shifts were asymmetric; arriving relatively early had disproportional stronger (or weaker) effects than arriving relatively late, and this varied with species identity. However, consistent with recent theory, these seemingly idiosyncratic effects of phenological shifts could be explained by species-specific differences in growth rates across temperatures and concordant shifts in relative body size of interacting species. Our results emphasize the need to account for environmental conditions when predicting the effects of phenological shifts, and suggest that shifts in size-structured interactions can mediate the impact of climate change on natural communities.

AB  - Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) enter aquatic ecosystems through discharged effluents, mainly from wastewater treatment works and diffuse run off from land, and affect a wide range of aquatic biota, including fish. Evidence for altered physiology in fish as a consequence of endocrine disruption is global, with some of the most widely reported effects on sexual development and function. In recent years, research has shown that fish behaviors can also be affected by EDCs which potentially has wide implications for individual fitness and population level outcomes. This review presents a critical assessment on reported effects of EDCs on behavior in fish, focusing on behaviors associated with reproduction. We investigate commonalities and differences in sexual behaviors between fish species most commonly applied in ecotoxicology, drawing out common principles for impacts of EDCs and then reviewing the evidence for, and implications of, disruptions of these behaviors after exposures to EDCs. In an analysis of the reported effects of exposure to the estrogen ethinylestradiol, we show that life-stage at exposure is a key factor determining behavioral responses of affected populations. EDC-induced changes in behavior occur at similar concentrations as for established biomarker responses (e. g. vitellogenin induction for estrogens), indicating behavior is equally sensitive (and noninvasive) as an indicator of EDC exposure. Adopting behaviors in fish as indicators of chemical exposure and effects, however, still has many technical and interpretation challenges and there is very little information available on how behaviors under laboratory conditions equate with those occurring in wild populations.

AB  - The private Grootbos Nature Reserve is located at the Western edge of the Agulhas Plain in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, an area characterized by high habitat and floristic diversity. The Reserve is covered in near-natural fynbos shrublands with a few patches of forest and wetland. The main objective of this study was to classify the vegetation into discrete units and relate them to the prevailing environmental conditions. The vegetation was analysed by numerical means (TWINSPAN, DCA, CCA) and mapped on GIS. At the vegetation type level, Forest & Thicket and Fynbos formed distinctive clusters, whereas the wetland releves were intermixed, but without relationships to one of these units. Fire incidence served as the major determinant of the forest-fynbos boundary. The Forest & Thicket grouping was separated into Thicket (as transitional to fynbos), Afromontane Forest and Milkwood Scrub Forest. Two broad complexes were distinguished within the Fynbos grouping, the Alkaline Sand Fynbos Complex corresponding to Coastal Fynbos, and the Acid Sand Fynbos Complex corresponding to Mountain Fynbos. They discriminated along gradients of pH, soil depth and rock cover. The complexes were further subdivided into formations by using one or a few subjectively chosen dominant species as indicators. The transitions between these formations were rather continuous than discrete. The vegetation type and complex levels correspond well to existing fynbos-wide classifications. Comparing the formations to the results of other vegetation studies is problematic even on the scale of the Agulhas Plain, due to the high regional plant diversity in the Fynbos Biome.

AB  - Limnological data collected for two years at nine sites in the southern end of Cayuga Lake, NY, before the start-up of a cooling water facility (summer 2000), are analyzed to identify appropriate measures of trophic state and estimate the capability of a monitoring program to identify changes associated with the operation of this facility. The concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl) is found to be the preferred indicator of trophic state. The concentration of total phosphorus and clarity are compromised as trophic indicators in this system because of the contributions of inanimate particles (tripton) to these measures associated with the hydrology and morphometry of the lake and the occurrence of the whiting phenomenon. A Before-After-Control-Impact design is used to assess the ability of the monitoring program to detect potential impacts associated with operation of the cooling water facility. Statistical power analyses conducted with the pre-operational monitoring data indicate the current bi-weekly sampling program will detect a 30% change in Chi with a probability of 0.7. Attributing causation of any future change in Chl coincident with the start-up and operation of the cooling water facility is problematic because of potential confounding effects associated with variation in phosphorus loading from wastewater treatment facilities, natural variation in meteorological conditions, and water quality changes associated with zebra mussel populations.

AB  - There is great size variation in naturally occurring and laboratory-reared populations of larvae of Hexagenia species. We investigated differences in mean larval size and survivorship of Hexagenia limbata and Hexagenia rigida reared at different temperatures (12, 17, and 22-degrees-C) and photoperiods (24 h L, 24 h D, 12 h L : 12 h D) over two time intervals (60 and 120 d) in the laboratory. Owing to space limitations, two sets of replicates (3 replicates per set) were conducted in sequence for the 60-d trial. Larvae were hatched from eggs collected from imagoes at the Detroit River near Windsor, Ontario, and stored at 8-degrees-C. Of the factors examined, temperature alone influenced larval size after 60 d of growth. None of the factors had any significant effect on larval survival after 60 d. Larvae from the second 60-d replicate set (hatched from eggs incubated for 75 d longer than the first set) were larger and exhibited lower survivorship than larvae in the first set. This finding suggests that larval size may not be a good indicator of larval age, especially if eggs have been exposed to low temperatures for varying periods. Temperature and its interaction with photoperiod significantly affected both size and survivorship of larvae reared for 120 d. At 22-degrees-C, larvae reared under the 12 h L : 12 h D regime were larger than those reared under either constant tight or dark conditions: no discernible trend in photoperiod was evident at the lower temperatures. Larval survivorship was lowest for treatments exhibiting conflicting environmental cues (12-degrees-C and 24 h L, and 22-degrees-C and 24 h D).

AB  - The ciliate phylum is a group of protists noted for their unusual membrane trafficking system and apparent environmental ubiquity; as highly successful microbial predators, they are found in all manner of environments and the ability for specific species to adapt to extremely challenging conditions makes them valued as bioindicators. Ciliates have also been used for many years as cell biological models because of their large cell size and ease of culturing, and for many fundamental cell structures, particularly membrane-bound organelles, ciliates were some of the earliest organisms in which these were observed via microscopy. In this study, we carried out a comparative genomic survey of selected membrane trafficking proteins in a pan-ciliate transcriptome and genome dataset. We observed considerable loss of membrane trafficking system (MTS) proteins that would indicate a loss of machinery that is generally conserved across eukaryotic diversity, even after controlling for potentially incomplete genome representation. In particular, the complete DSL1 complex was missing in all surveyed ciliates. This protein complex has been shown as involved in peroxisome biogenesis in some model systems, and a paucity of DSL1 components has been indicative of degenerate peroxisome. However, Tetrahymena thermophila (formerly Tetrahymena pyroformis) was one of the original models for visualizing peroxisomes. Conversely, the AP3 complex essential for mucocyst maturation in T. thermophila, is poorly conserved despite the presence of secretory lysosome-related organelles across ciliate diversity. We discuss potential resolutions for these apparent paradoxes in the context of the heterogenous distribution of MTS machinery across the diversity of ciliates.

AB  - Benthic diatom assemblages are known to be indicative of water quality but have yet to be widely adopted in biological assessments in the United States due to several limitations. Our goal was to address some of these limitations by developing regional multi-metric indices (MMIs) that are robust to inter-laboratory taxonomic inconsistency, adjusted for natural covariates, and sensitive to a wide range of anthropogenic stressors. We aggregated bioassessment data from two national-scale federal programs and used a data-driven analysis in which all-possible combinations of 2-7 metrics were compared for three measures of performance. After ranking the best-performing MMIs, we selected the final MMIs by evaluating stress-response relations in independent regional datasets of diatom samples paired with measures of several water-quality stressors, including herbicides and streamflow flashiness. Each regional MMI performed well at calibration sites and represented diverse aspects of the structure and function of diatom communities. Most metrics included in the best MMIs were modeled to account for natural variation including climate, topography, soil characteristics, lithology, and groundwater influence on streamflow. MMI performance improved with higher numbers of component metrics, but this effect diminished beyond six metrics. Component metrics of MMIs were associated with a broad suite of measured stressors in every region, including salinity, nutrients, herbicides, and streamflow flashiness. We provide a web based software application that allows users in the conterminous United States to apply our MMIs to their own datasets and compare MMI scores from their sites to a broader regional context.

AB  - Chromium (Cr) and tannin are two major pollutants in leather industry. However, little is known about the co migration of leather tannins and Cr in soils. In this study, column experiments were conducted to estimate Cr leaching behavior from topsoil and the environmental risk of the leachate at various tannin dosages and different ways (tannin either directly adding to the Cr-contaminated soil or adding stepwise through simulated rain) into the soil. The total Cr concentration in leachate was positively related with tannin content in soil, while Cr (VI) concentration was negatively correlated. The maximum cumulative leaching efficiency of total Cr from soil after six leaching events was 44.65% with 3 mg/g tannin adding into soil directly, and the maximum cumulative leaching efficiency of Cr (VI) was 38.75% with simulated rain leaching Cr-contaminated soil. With 3 mg/g tannin adding into soil, tannin concentration in the top layer (0-7 cm) lost by 32.67% after leaching, the amount of decomposed tannin was 0.25 mg/g, excluding the amount of tannin in leachate (3.63 mg/L) and the original amount in the soil (0.34 mg/g), indicating a slow degradation under natural condition. Both of the total Cr and Cr (VI) concentration in each layer of the soil columns decreased under tannin treatments compared with control. Compared with tannin adding stepwise into simulated rain, adding tannin into soil significantly (p < 0.05) affected the migration of Cr. Tannin increased the residual fraction while decreased the exchangeable fraction of Cr in the soils. Overall, this research can provide reference information for environmental risk assessment of contaminants in tanning sites.

AB  - The persistent increase of artificial light emissions is causing a progressive brightening of the night sky in most regions of the world. This process is a threat for the long-term sustainability of the scientific and educational activity of ground-based astronomical observatories operating in the optical range. Huge investments in building, scientific and technical workforce, equipment and maintenance can be at risk if the increasing light pollution levels hinder the capability of carrying out the top-level scientific observations for which these key scientific infrastructures were built. Light pollution has other negative consequences, as e.g. biodiversity endangering and the loss of the starry sky for recreational, touristic and preservation of cultural heritage. The traditional light pollution mitigation approach is based on imposing conditions on the photometry of individual sources, but the aggregated effects of all sources in the territory surrounding the observatories are seldom addressed in the regulations. We propose that this approach shall be complemented with a top-down, ambient artificial skyglow immission limits strategy, whereby clear limits are established to the admissible deterioration of the night sky above the observatories. We describe the general form of the indicators that can be employed to this end, and develop linear models relating their values to the artificial emissions across the territory. This approach can be easily applied to other protection needs, like e.g. to protect nocturnal ecosystems, and it is expected to be useful for making informed decisions on public lighting, in the context of wider spatial planning projects.

AB  - The Wider Caribbean Region is an important tourist destination where agricultural, industrial and shipping activities are also carried on. Coastal zones are heavily populated and receive a high human pressure; however, few monitoring programmes allow assessing long-term anthropogenic impact trends in these areas, which are especially useful for integrated management programs. Through the support of the International Atomic Energy Agency (project RLA/7/012), sediment core activities of Pb-210 and Cs-137 were used to evaluate changes in sedimentation rates in 11 relevant coastal areas of the region, where environmental information is scarce, but needed to support national environmental policies. Most Pb-210 activity profiles were atypical, attributed to nonsteady sedimentation conditions; whereas Cs-137 activity profiles, showing very low values, were of little help for Pb-210-dating corroboration. Results evidenced conspicuous changes in mass accumulation rates (MAR), specially through the Anthropocene (i.e. since -1950s) in most cases, attributed to deforestation and land erosion (one of the clearest indicators of global change), and the input of urban and industrial untreated wastes. The recent MAR decrease in Havana Bay (Cuba) was attributed to the implementation of environmental policies, which showed that Pb-210-derived reconstruction of environmental changes is also useful to verify the effectiveness of management programs to control land-derived erosion and siltation issues. Since siltation can be detrimental to valuable coastal resources around the world, retrospective evaluations of sedimentation rates, based on Pb-210-dated cores, are highly recommended to assist integrated coastal zone management programs in the region and elsewhere.

AB  - Scientific knowledge, societal debates, and industry commitments around sustainable cocoa are increasing. Cocoa agroforestry systems are supposed to improve the sustainability of cocoa production. However, their combined agronomic, ecological, and socio-economic performance compared to monocultures is still largely unknown. Here we present a meta-analysis of 52 articles that directly compared cocoa agroforestry systems and monocultures. Using an inductive, multi-dimensional approach, we analyzed the differences in cocoa and total system yield, economic performance, soil chemical and physical properties, incidence of pests and diseases, potential for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and biodiversity conservation. Cocoa agroforestry systems outcompeted monocultures in most indicators. Cocoa yields in agroforestry systems were 25% lower than in monocultures, but total system yields were about ten times higher, contributing to food security and diversified incomes. This finding was supported by a similar profitability of both production systems. Cocoa agroforestry contributed to climate change mitigation by storing 2.5 times more carbon and to adaptation by lowering mean temperatures and buffering temperature extremes. We found no significant differences in relation to the main soil parameters. The effect of the type of production system on disease incidence depended on the fungal species. The few available studies comparing biodiversity showed a higher biodiversity in cocoa agroforestry systems. Increased and specific knowledge on local tree selections and local socio-economic and environmental conditions, as well as building and enabling alternative markets for agroforestry products, could contribute to further adoption and sustainability of cocoa agroforestry systems.

AB  - Background: Variation in leaf morphology is an important indicator of how plants respond to different environmental conditions. Leaf trait variation is associated with physiological responses of plants to gradients of humidity and temperature.
   Objective: We analyzed the variation in the leaf morphological and functional traits of Quercus elliptica and its relationships with environmental and geographic variables across the distribution of this species to evaluate population differentiation using ecological niche models.
   Study species: Quercus elliptica Nee (Fagaceae).
   Study sites and dates: Plants were collected in diverse forest types between 350 and 2,400 min elevation in Mexico and Central America during 2016 and 2017.
   Methods: We measured and analyzed the differentiation in morphological and functional traits of 4,017 leaves from 402 trees from 41 populations using univariate and multivariate analyses.
   Results: The leaf length and thickness and specific leaf area (SLA) of Q. elliptica were significantly correlated with the seasonality of temperature, precipitation, elevation and aridity. We identified two divergent morphological groups: (1) populations distributed along the Pacific coast with broad and thin elliptical leaves with high SLA values and inhabited humid forests at more than 1,200 m elevation, and (2) populations located along the Gulf of Mexico coast, and in southern Mexico and Central America with thicker, narrower leaves and lower SLA values and inhabited seasonal tropical forests in less than 1,200 m in elevation.
   Conclusions: Climate and geographic barriers and the ecological niche models supported the population differentiation of Q. elliptica.

AB  - The world has become a noisier place due to the increase in urbanization. Noise is generally considered an impediment, altering an animal's behavior through masking or distraction. But noise can also provide useful information about the environment. For animals that rely on natural environmental noise as an indicator of favorable foraging conditions, increasing levels of anthropogenic noise might mislead informed decision-making. Bats use rain noise, a natural environmental cue, to delay their emergence from the roost, presumably to avoid sensory and metabolic costs associated with foraging in heavy rain. Here we tested the "misleading cue hypothesis," asking whether traffic noise is mistaken for rain noise by bats. Given the acoustic similarity between rain noise and traffic noise, we predicted that bats would confuse the two. We conducted a playback experiment using rain, traffic, and ambient noise at natural roosts of common big-eared bats (Micronycteris microtis, Phyllostomidae) and recorded bat emergence behavior. In contrast to their response to rain noise, the bats did not delay roost emergence in response to traffic noise. Thus, we found that bats were able to discriminate between traffic noise and rain noise and were not misled by similarity in acoustic parameters in the two noise types, when emerging from their roost. Emerging bats did show more exploration flights during traffic noise than during rain noise, but not during ambient noise, suggesting that they perceive traffic noise as a novel acoustic cue. Our data provide new insights into perception of traffic noise by bats.

AB  - The relative contribution of environmental and spatial drivers of community structure has been the focus of many ecological studies. In the context of metacommunity theory, diatoms have been associated mainly with local environmental factors, but in some cases spatial factors have also been identified as important drivers. This study aimed to determine the relative importance of environmental and spatial drivers as predictors of surface sediment and water column diatom assemblages in tropical reservoirs. Sampling was carried out in 33 reservoirs in southeast Brazil, which range in trophic state from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic, and span five hydrological basins. We performed a partial RDA between the predictor matrices (environmental and spatial predictors) and the response matrix (either surface sediment or water column diatom assemblages) to identify the main environmental drivers, and used variation partitioning to assess the relative contribution of environmental and spatial predictors of diatom assemblages. In general, diatom assemblages were structured by a combination of environmental and spatial drivers. Comparisons of results between surface sediment and water column ordinations demonstrated that the assemblages were structured by similar environmental variables (productivity-related variables such as total phosphorus, water transparency and pH) and by a similar set of diatom species, mainly centric diatoms like Aulacoseira granulata var. granulata, A. tenella, Discostella stelligera and Spicaticribra kingstonii. Overall, surface sediment diatoms were more strongly associated with environmental factors than were water-column assemblages, probably because they integrate information in space and time, confirming that surface sediment assemblages are robust indicators of environmental conditions.

AB  - The present study was carried out to determine the contamination levels of heavy metals in road dust of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT), India and its consequent effect on human and environment. The levels of heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, Mn, and Fe) in 9 districts (Z1-Z9) of NCT were monitored and the corresponding human health risk was estimated. District-wise evaluation of heavy metal pollution in the road dust was performed. The mean concentrations of Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, Mn, and Fe in the road dust samples over the study area were 164.2 +/- 53.2, 200.7 +/- 45.3, 99.9 +/- 64.8, 24.7 +/- 5.7, 57.7 +/- 25.9, 241.4 +/- 39.8, and 11113.9 +/- 1669.7 mg kg(-1), respectively. PLI showed a high pollution load in the monitored nine locations, indicating an alarming condition and the urgent need for immediate remedial actions. Ecological risk assessment depicted that a 74% risk was attributed to Pb. Hazard quotient (HQ) values indicated that ingestion was the major pathway of road dust heavy metal exposure to human beings. Hazard index values showed that there was no probable non-carcinogenic risk of the heavy metals present in the road dust of the area. Children were found vulnerable to the risks of road dust metals. The findings of this study showed the alarming status of heavy metal contamination to road dust in NCT and the associated risk to human health.

AB  - The long-term fertilization results in accumulation of phosphorus especially in the top layer of the soils. Inundation of agricultural lands leads to a switch to anaerobic soil condition, causing reduction of iron and leaching of phosphate simultaneously. From the ecological and environmental perspective, high nutrients flux especially phosphorus will increase the possibility of eutrophication in aquatic system. The fern Azolla had a good potential to adsorb phosphorus, it also has distinctive nitrogen-fixing capacity. We conducted a 10-week aquarium experiment to investigate the phosphorus release capacity from two agricultural soils in the Netherlands with different Fe and P concentrations but comparable Fe/P ratios. Besides, the research questions rose to whether Azolla could use the mobilized phosphate released from the soils for growth. We also tried to find an effective indicator to estimate the actually phosphate mobilization from sediment to water layer. Results showed that the soils with high Fe and P concentrations had higher phosphate release rate compared with the soil with low Fe and P concentrations. Pore water Fe: PO43- ratios were valid to identify P release to surface water, when the Fe: PO43- ratios less than 8 mol mol(-1) substantial phosphorus mobilization occurred. The conclusions showed that the actual mobilization of phosphate is more important than the phosphorus retained in the sediments for the internal PO43- fluxes. From 10-week experimental results, we found that Azolla can reuse the phosphate retained in soils thus removed the mobilized phosphate in a moderately low surface water nutrient loading.

AB  - Aim. The environmental-epidemiological monitoring of socially significant pathology and its forecasting for the development of effective preventive measures and environmental quality management methods in the Republic of Dagestan
   Material and Methods. An epidemiological analysis of public health indicators was carried out in 41 municipalities and 10 urban districts of the Republic of Dagestan. This was carried out through current and retrospective analysis of regional health indicators, medical-geographical and mathematical statistical analysis. The data sources for the main indicators reflect the epidemiological situation in the Republic of Dagestan from 1997 to 2016.
   Results. An understanding of the status of the main epidemiological indicators of the condition of public health of the region's rural and urban population was obtained and future dynamics predicted. An integrated assessment of the well-being of the territory of the republic revealed areas and cities with adverse trends in public health in the main groups of socially significant and environmentally-related pathologies.
   Conclusions. An integrated assessment of the state of well-being in the Republic of Dagestan by groups of epidemiological indicators of general morbidity, general morbidity of various age groups of the population, socially significant and environmentally-caused morbidity, as well as a forecast of their dynamics, revealed adverse trends in public health in rural populations of Tsuntinskiy, Akhtynskiy, Gunibskiy, Kulinskiy, Tabasaranskiy, Nogayskiy, Novolakskiy, Suleiman-Stalskiy, Khasavyurtskiy, Tarumovskiy districts and of the cities of Kaspiysk, Dagestanskie Ogni, Makhachkala and Kizilyurt. An analysis of the sources of supplies of drinking water revealed a positive correlation between heavy metals content and adverse trends in socially significant pathology in the regions of Northern Dagestan.

AB  - The isozyme variability and morphometric analysis were examined in three populations of the fiddler crab, Austruca sindensis. The crab samples were collected from the three populations of A. sindensis (Sandspit, Sonari, and Sonmiani) along the coast of Pakistan. Three different enzymes, Catalase (CAT), Carbonate dehydratase (CD), Amylase (Amy) and a general protein pattern were investigated. Two isozymes were identified to be useful for the populations differentiation of A. sindensis along the coast of Pakistan. POPGENE software was used for the analysis of banding pattern, polymorphic loci, allelic frequency, heterozygosity and genetic distance of three populations of A. sindensis; while, Minitab and MS-Excel was used for the analysis of morphometric analysis. Four polymorphic loci, CAT-I, CAT-II, CD-I and CD-II were interpretable in muscle with Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE), the allele frequency differs significantly, detected in population of the Sonmiani Bay as compared with Sonari and Sandspit. The morphometric analysis showed low level of variability among the three studied populations when total 8 selected morphometric traits were analyzed (wet weight (WW), carapace length (CL), carapace width (CW), abdominal length (AL), abdominal width (AW), enlarged chela length (EL), enlarged chela width (EW), pleopode length (PL)). Multiple statistical approaches applied; regression analysis, ANOVA and Discriminant function analysis (DFA). Among all the statistical analysis used total three traits, showed significant variations among three populations (CW, EL and AL). The result of this study indicated that not only the morphological difference reflects the environmental conditions of habitat, but also the biochemical variations can be considered as the indicator of specific population dispersal.

AB  - Following the pre-accession to the European Union (EU), significant changes have taken place in the agricultural policy and practice in Romania, with implications in the productivity and management of the agricultural landscape. After the EU-accession, the implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) provided support for both rural development and sustainable agriculture. At the same time, the increasing demand of consumers for high quality products on the one hand, and the need to protect and improve the quality of the environment as a result of organic land management practices, on the other, provided the perfect frame for the development of organic farming. The current study aims at providing an insight into the organic agriculture in Romania, with a special focus on the southern part of Romania (Romanian Plain and Dobrogea Plateau), an area which enjoys favourable natural conditions for this type of sustainable agriculture. The key findings of the paper are the identification of the linkages between EU/national policies and organic farming; building up a large geodatabase and providing spatial and statistical assessments of up-to-date records on organic farming based on data provided by the National Institute of Statistics, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and the EUROSTAT statistics and reports, as well as by the inspection and certification bodies. Based on the data gathered from the 720 organic operators at LAU 2 level in southern Romania. various indicators (e.g. cultivated area with different crops, organic farms by size class of agricultural area used, number of organic operators) were computed and represented spatially using GIS techniques.

AB  - Monitoring is increasingly recognised as a key instrument for effective nature conservation. It attempts to provide quantitative knowledge to implement conservation actions upon scientific evidence. However, science studies have shown that monitoring is not only a simple technical choice but also carries a cognitive representation of the world and plays a social role. Based on a socioethnographic approach involving 94 semi-structured interviews in seven national parks in tropical Africa and Indonesia, the objective of this study is to analyse the different dimensions of the relation between expertise and power, in the context of postcolonial environmental policies. Drawing on the limitations of monitoring programmes to guide management, this paper shows their unexpected roles and indirect effects. Monitoring appears as a means to provide parks with an effective existence following two dimensions. First, it enacts and contributes to convey a cognitive representation of nature conservation in those areas. Overall, monitoring programmes concentrate predominantly on long term scientific knowledge rather than on pragmatic and action driven knowledge. The majority ofprogrammes focuses on conserving charismatic species and banning illegal activities inside the park rather than on fostering sustainable human activities around the park. Second, the implementation of monitoring programmes gives the parks a material dimension. It provides human, financial, and logistical resources, it controls the parks' activities and structures the parks' governance and administration. Therefore, the day-to-day use of indicators and technical instruments relies less on their ability to drive action than on their capacity to shape power relationships and to produce a social reality. Our findings question the predominant place given to quantitative science and technique in nature conservation and the social conditions under which an evidence based policy can be implemented.

AB  - Social systems can be defined based on their degree of fission-fusion dynamics, which depends on party characteristics (i.e., spatial cohesion, party size, and sex-age composition). Although the ecological and ethological causes of fissionfusion dynamics are still under revision, fruit availability seems to be a main factor in party formation in primates. We therefore explored ecological (i.e., fruit availability as an indicator of food competition) and ethological factors (i.e., travel distance) related to fission-fusion dynamics using our own agent-based simulation model. We compared the simulation results from the model with field data obtained from the movement patterns of a wild group of red-capped mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus) (Dolado et al. 2016, Folia Primatol 87: 197-212) and found that they were consistent with field data obtained on C. torquatus in that they showed similar patterns of seasonal fission-fusion dynamics. Moreover, the results suggest that the fission-fusion dynamics observed in simulations can match patterns of travel distance of arboreal species subject to food competition that reflects behavioral flexibility to adapt to environmental conditions shown by C. torquatus in the field.
   Significance statement
   We have developed an agent-based model that reproduces the seasonal fission-fusion dynamics shown by a wild group of C. torquatus on the Atlantic coast of Gabon. The results of our simulations suggest that fission-fusion dynamics are an emergent behavior and that agent-based models are a good tool for exploring emergent behaviors in silico. Moreover, the agentbased simulation approach provides helpful new insights for future field studies on fission-fusion dynamics.

AB  - Heat stress in hot seasons is a major problem in poultry production, particularly in humid areas. The aim of this study was to determine the pharmacodynamics of betaine on the blood and cecal short chain fatty acid profile in meat-type ducks exposed to heat stress. Three-hundred-sixty meat-type ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) were randomly allocated into 4 treatments: C (heat stress control without betaine), T1 (700 ppm betaine), T2 (1,000 ppm betaine), and T3 (1,300 ppm betaine). Each treatment had 6 replicated pens with 15 meat-type ducks per pen. The study was conducted for 42 days. Our findings revealed that the betaine group had higher body weight gain compared to the control group under heat stress (P < 0.05). Betaine supplementation resulted in more significant improvement in hematological indicators such as RBCs and platelet counts than the heat stress control group (P < 0.05). Under the heat-wave environment, supplementation of betaine manifested a significant decrease in blood pH (P < 0.05) but not in electrolytes (Na+, K+ and Cl-) and gas concentration. The concentration of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) in the cecum was higher than the control under heat stress conditions. The total SCFA, acetic acid, and propionic acid production was higher in the betaine supplemented groups compared to the heat stress control group (P < 0.05). Results showed that betaine supplementation has beneficial effects in meat-type ducks under heat stress on short chain fatty acid levels, blood biochemical parameters, and body weight.

AB  - Transformation of coppices to high forests has caused fundamental changes in site conditions and a decline of many species across Central Europe. Nevertheless, some formerly coppiced forests still harbour a number of the declining species and have become biodiversity hotspots in the changing landscape. We focused on the best-preserved remnant of formerly grazed and coppiced subcontinental oak forest in the Czech Republic - the DAbrava forest near the town of Hodonin. To improve our understanding of the ecology of declining species, we studied local habitat requirements of vascular plants most endangered at the national level. We recorded vegetation composition and sampled important site variables in plots with the largest populations of endangered species and in additional plots placed randomly across all major forest habitats. We demonstrated that sites with endangered species have a highly uneven distribution in ecological space and that their species composition is often similar to open-canopy oak forests. Within this habitat, the endangered species are concentrated in places with a high light availability and high soil pH. Light-demanding species characteristic of subcontinental oak forests are the best indicators of these sites, while broadly distributed shade-tolerant and nutrient-demanding species avoid them. These results support the view that the occurrence of many endangered species in the DAbrava forest is a legacy of the long history of traditional management that kept the canopies open. Light-demanding species are now threatened by ongoing successional changes. Therefore, active conservation measures are recommended, including opening up the canopies, early thinning of young stands, control of expansive and invasive species and understorey grazing or mowing.

AB  - Cultural ecosystem services, many of which depend on biodiversity, are recognized as important but seldom quantified biophysically across landscapes. Furthermore, many ecosystem service models are static, and the supply of cultural ecosystem services may be misrepresented if seasonal shifts in biotic communities are ignored.
   We modeled landscape dynamics of wildflower blooms in a temperate montane landscape to determine (1) how floral resources (wildflower species richness, abundance, timing, and presence of charismatic species) changed over the growing season, (2) how projected wildflower viewing hotspots varied over space and time, and (3) how spatial shifts in floral resources affected potential public access to wildflower viewing.
   Data were collected at 63 sites across a rural-to-urban gradient in the Southern Appalachian Mountains (USA). Generalized linear models were used to identify factors affecting floral resources at two temporal scales. Floral resources were projected across the landscape and hotspots of wildflower viewing were quantified using overlay analysis.
   Floral resources were affected by topoedaphic conditions, climate, and surrounding building density and changed seasonally. Seasonal models revealed locational shifts in ecosystem service hotspots, which changed the proportion of hotspots accessible to the public and identified wildflower-viewing opportunities unnoticed by static models.
   Relationships between landscape gradients, biodiversity, and ecosystem service supply varied seasonally, and our models identified cultural ecosystem service hotspots otherwise obscured by simple proxies. Landscape models of biodiversity-based cultural ecosystem services should include seasonal dynamics of biotic communities to avoid under- or over-emphasizing the importance of particular locations in ecosystem service assessments.

AB  - Polyploid species generally occupy harsher habitats (characterized by cold, drought and/or high altitude) than diploids, but the converse was observed for Chamerion angustifolium, in which diploid plants generally inhabit higher altitudes than their polyploid derivatives. Plants at high altitudes may experience cold-induced water stress, and we therefore examined the physiological responses of diploid and hexaploid angustifolium to water stress to better understand the ecological differentiation of plants with different ploidy levels. We conducted a common garden experiment by subjecting seedlings of different ploidy levels to low, moderate, and severe water stress. Fourteen indicators of physiological fitness were measured, and the anatomical characteristics of the leaves of each cytotype were determined. Both cytotypes were influenced by drought, and diploids exhibited higher fitness in terms of constant root:shoot ratio (R:S ratio) and maximum quantum yield of PS II (F-v/F-m), less reduced maximal photosynthetic rate (A(max)), transpiration rate (E), intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i) and stomatal conductance (gs), and higher long-term water use efficiency (WUEL) under severe water stress than did hexaploids. Analysis of leaf anatomy revealed morphological adjustments for tolerating water deficiency in diploids, in the form of closely packed mesophyll cells and small conduits in the midvein. Our results indicate that diploid C. angustifolium is more tolerant of drought than hexaploid plants, ensuring the successful survival of the diploid at high altitudes. This eco-physiological divergence may facilitate the species with different cytotypes to colonize new and large geographic ranges with heterogeneous environmental conditions.

AB  - Alpine tundra ecosystems have specific vegetation and environmental conditions that may affect soil phosphorus (P) composition and phosphatase activities. However, these effects are poorly understood. This study used NaOH-EDTA extraction and solution P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine soil P composition and phosphatase activities, including acid phosphomonoesterase (AcP), phosphodiesterase (PD) and inorganic pyrophosphatase (IPP), in the alpine tundra of the Changbai Mountains at seven different altitudinal gradients (i.e., 2000 m, 2100 m, 2200 m, 2300 m, 2400 m, 2500 m, and 2600 m). The results show that total P (TP), organic P (OP), OP/TP, NaOH-EDTA extracted P and AcP, PD, and IPP activities over the altitude range of 2500-2600 m are significantly lower than those below 2400 m. The dominant extracted form of P is OP (73%-83%) with a large proportion of monoesters (65%-72%), whereas inorganic P is present in lower proportions (17%-27%). The activity of AcP is significantly positively correlated with the contents of soil OP, total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), and TP (P < 0.05), indicating that the AcP is a more sensitive index for responding P nutrient storage than PD and IPP. Soil properties, P composition, and phosphatase activities decrease with increased altitude and soil pH. Our results indicate that the distribution of soil P composition and phosphatase activities along altitude and AcP may play an important role in P hydrolysis as well as have the potential to be an indicator of soil quality.

The chronology of the related depositional events is provided from C-14 dating of tree trunks buried at depths of ca. 9 m and organic matter from the underlying horizons.
   Results and discussion The data indicate that (1) the upper part of the sequence (down to depths of 9 m) includes sediments characterized by low nickel-chromium (Ni-Cr) concentrations ascribed to the alluvial deposits of the river Reno, deposited in the last 400 years; (2) buried soils (depths of 9-10.5 m) developed on Ni-Cr-rich sediments related to the river Po; and (3) the deeper facies (depths of 10.5-13 m) are CaCO3-free and characterized by higher amounts of organic carbon, sulphur and arsenic, reflecting episodic lacustrine/marsh environments. These wetlands probably developed in the area during the Iron and Roman ages, persisting up to the Middle Ages.
   Conclusions The data provide a contribution to the understanding of the evolution of the river network during the last 3,000 years and provide insights on the related paleohydrological framework that can be useful for geographical and historical reconstructions of the area. Results highlight the importance of investigating alluvial sediments to elucidate (1) fluctuations of environmental conditions and (2) anthropogenic impacts on the natural landscape.

AB  - Unnecessary school bus idling increases children's exposure to diesel exhaust, but to what extent children are exposed to ultrafine particles (UFPs, diameter < 100 nm) in and around idling school buses remains unclear. This study employed nine school buses and simulated five scenarios by varying emissions source, wind direction, and window position. The purpose was to investigate the impact of idling on UFP number concentration and PM2.5 mass concentration inside and near school buses. Near the school buses, total particle number concentration increased sharply from engine off to engine on under all scenarios, by a factor of up to 26. The impact of idling on UFP number concentration inside the school buses depended on wind direction and window position: wind direction was important and statistically significant while the effect of window positions depended on wind direction. Under certain scenarios, idling increased in-cabin total particle number concentrations by a factor of up to 5.8, with the significant increase occurring in the size range of 10-30 nm. No significant change of in-cabin PM2.5 mass concentration was observed due to idling, regardless of wind direction and window position, indicating that PM2.5 is not a good indicator for primary diesel exhaust particle exposure. The deposition rates based on total particle number concentration inside school bus cabins varied between 1.5 and 5.0 h(-1) across nine tested buses under natural convection conditions, lower than those of passenger cars but higher than those of indoor environments.

AB  - Water is scarce in Mediterranean countries: cities are crowded with increasing demand; food is produced with large amounts of water; ecosystems demand more water that is often available; drought affects all. As climate change impacts become more noticeable and costlier, some current water management strategies will not be useful. According to the findings of CIRCE, the areas with limited water resources will increase in the coming decades with major consequences for the way we produce food and we protect ecosystems. Based on these projections this paper discusses water policy priorities for climate change adaptation in the Mediterranean. We first summarise the main challenges to water resources in Mediterranean countries and outline the risks and opportunities for water under climate change based on previous studies. Recognising the difficulty to go from precipitation to water policy, we then present a framework to evaluate water availability in response to natural and management conditions, with an example of application in the Ebro basin that exemplifies other Mediterranean areas. Then we evaluate adaptive capacity to understand the ability of Mediterranean countries to face, respond and recover from climate change impacts on water resources. Social and economic factors are key drivers of inequality in the adaptive capacity across the region. Based on the assessment of impacts and adaptive capacity we suggest thresholds for water policy to respond to climate change and link water scarcity indicators to relevant potential adaptation strategies. Our results suggest the need to further prioritise socially and economically sensitive policies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Two humic acids (HAs) were isolated from contaminated river sediments present under comparative conditions in the Pearl River Basin, China. YFHA (the HA extracted at an open pyrite mining area in Yunfu) exhibited a lower absorption intensity for certain bands in the Fourier transform infrared spectra, a lower E-4/E-6 value (the UV absorbances at 465 nm (E-4) and 665 nm (E-6)), a lower apparent molecular weight, a lower polarity and a lower oxygen functionality in comparison with GZHA (the HA isolated at an urban living area in Guangzhou). All these differences indicated a higher degree of humification of YFHA than GZHA. Overall, the enrichment patterns of permanent heavy metals in the studied HAs were similar to those in corresponding sediments. In particular, YFHA exhibited high enrichment of trace element Tl, a characteristic concomitant from the mining of the pyrite minerals. The adsorption isotherms of two HAs for goethite and pyrolusite, two representative geological materials, conformed to the Langmuir equation. Based on the qualitative relationships between the Langmuir constants of the adsorption isotherms and the chemical characteristics of HAs, the main mechanism of HA adsorption on these materials was suggested to be hydrophobic interaction. This study highlighted the promising use of HA as a peculiar bio-indicator of uncommon trace metal contaminations. The HA adsorption mechanism on representative geological materials further provided a theoretical basis for the study on the unusual metal behavior in complex environmental settings.

AB  - Questions: 1. Does flood pulsing drive metacommunity dynamics and provide insurance against catastrophic flooding in desert southwestern riparian ecosystems? 2. Do upland and wetland species in the floodplain differ in their dynamics?
   Location: Southwestern USA.
   Methods: We sampled vegetation and propagule banks in four communities along a floodplain hydrogradient. Plant species were classified as wetland or upland and community wetland indicator scores were calculated. ANOVA tested for differences between data categories amongst communities ( extant vegetation and propagule banks) and soil depths. Sorensen's similarity coefficient was calculated to determine compositional similarity between vegetation and propagule banks.
   Results: Community propagule banks had high similarity indicating broad dispersal by flood waters. Wetland propagules were present in soils from channel bars to floodplain edges, despite declines in wetland vegetation with distance from channel. Wetland communities in propagule banks were dissimilar from those in vegetation except on channel bars. Upland species ( vegetation and propagule banks) increased with distance from channel. Propagules of upland species were most abundant in the litter, and were compositionally similar to upland species in most communities.
   Conclusions: Flood pulsing is one mechanism that drives spatiotemporal metacommunity dynamics in dynamic desert riparian ecosystems. The homogenized regional propagule bank created by flood pulsing provides wetland species with a mechanism to escape local extinction by allowing for recolonization after flooding creates suitable establishment conditions. Upland species are able to germinate from in-situ sources after small-scale flooding or rainfall moistens soil. In fluctuating environments, these dynamics sustain biodiversity in the face of ongoing environmental change.

AB  - We compiled salt marsh monitoring datasets from 36 complete or imminent restoration projects in the Gulf of Maine to assess regional monitoring and restoration practices. Data were organized by functional indicators and restoration project types (culvert replacement, excavation works, or ditch plugging) then pooled to generate mean values for indicators before restoration, after restoration, and at reference sites. Monitoring data were checked against the regional standards of a voluntary protocol for the Gulf of Maine. Data inventories showed that vegetation and salinity indicators were most frequently collected (89 and 78% of sites, respectively), whereas nekton, bird, and hydrologic measures were collected at only about half of the sites. Reference conditions were monitored at 72% of sites. Indicators were analyzed to see if project sites were degraded relative to reference areas and to detect ecological responses to restoration activities. Results showed that compared to reference areas, prerestoration sites had smaller tidal ranges, reduced salinity levels, greater cover of brackish plants species, and lower cover of halophyte plants. Following restoration, physical factors rebounded rapidly with increased flood and salinity levels after about one year, especially for culvert projects. Biological responses were less definitive and occurred over longer time frames. Plant communities trended toward recovered halophytes and reduced brackish species at 3+ years following restoration. Nekton and avian indicators were indistinguishable among reference, impacted, and restored areas. The protocol was successful in demonstrating restoration response for the region, but results were limited by regional inconsistencies in field practices and relatively few multiyear datasets. To improve future assessment capabilities, we encourage greater adherence to the standard protocol throughout the Gulf of Maine salt marsh restoration community.

AB  - Ocean chemistry is affected by pCO(2) in the atmosphere by increasing the dissolution of solid calcium carbonate and elevating the dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations in seawater. Positive feedbacks between the ocean and atmosphere can maintain high atmospheric pCO(2) and affect global climate. We report evidence for changes in the oceanic carbon cycle from the first high-quality organic carbon (C-org) data set of Eocene sediments beneath the equatorial Pacific upwelling region (Leg 199 of the Ocean Drilling Program). Eocene C-org mass accumulation rates (MARs) are 10 times lower than Holocene rates, even though expected C-org MARs estimated from biogenic-barium MARs (an indicator of biological production) equal or exceed modern fluxes. What happened to the missing C-org? Recent advances in ecology and biochemical kinetics show that the metabolism of nearly all animals, marine and terrestrial, is positively correlated by first principles to environmental temperatures. The approximately 10 degrees C abyssal temperature difference from Eocene to Holocene should have radically reduced pelagic C-org burial, as we observe. We propose that higher basal metabolism and nutrient utilization/recycling rates in the Eocene water column and surface sediments precluded C-org sediment burial in the pelagic ocean. Increased rates of metabolism, nutrient utilization, and lowered C-org sedimentation caused by increased temperature may have acted as a biological feedback to maintain high atmospheric pCO(2) and hothouse climates. Conversely, these same parameters would reverse sign to maintain low pCO(2) when temperatures decrease, thereby maintaining "icehouse'' conditions during cold climate regimes.

AB  - Accumulation and depuration kinetics in the samples of mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis L. 1758) and sea snail (Rapana venosa (Valenciennes, 1846)) exposed to Cs-137 radioisotope via seawater exposure were investigated under laboratory conditions. Accumulation and depuration kinetics were monitored for 49 and 59 days, respectively. Concentration factor and biological half-life values were calculated from the accumulation and depuration kinetics of mussel and sea snail samples. Concentration factors at equilibrium were 16.25 +/- 4.41 and 19.50 +/- 1.17 for large and small mussels, respectively, while 16.34 +/- 0.70 and 14.31 +/- 0.63 for large and small snails, respectively. The biological half-lives at slow components were 38.50 and 77.00 days for large and small mussels, respectively, while 49.50 and 57.75 days for large and small snails, respectively. Compared to the literature, the slightly higher concentration factor and biological half-life values obtained in this study for both mussel and snail samples may help to identify these species as bio-indicators of the Cs-137 radioisotope in the marine environment. In addition, it was statistically determined that body size is an important parameter for both living organisms in bioaccumulation experiments unlike the depuration experiments. In the light of all these results, it has been determined that mussel and sea snail organisms are extremely valuable indicators in terms of reflecting radioactive pollution in the sea in monitoring the Cs-137 radioisotope for possible inputs of any radioactive pollution in the marine environment.

AB  - Due to widespread manipulation of nitrogen (N), much research has focused on processes controlling the fate of anthropogenic N in streams. Yet, in a variety of oligotrophic systems, N fixed by periphyton is a significant driver of ecosystem metabolism. Due to difficulties partitioning allochthonous and autochthonous sources, there is limited information regarding how the latter is processed. Autochthonous N may be particularly important in alpine, arid, or polar environments. We test the hypothesis that the availability of remineralized autochthonous N is controlled by connectivity between the hyporheic zone and main channel due to the contrasting biogeochemical functions of benthic autotrophs (including N-fixing Nostoc) and hyporheic heterotrophs in an intermittent Antarctic stream. There, we collected surface water and hyporheic water concurrently at 4-6 h intervals over a 32.5 h period during one flow season and opportunistically throughout a second. Hyporheic water had 7 to 30 times greater nitrate-N concentrations relative to surface water across all flow conditions. In contrast, ammonium concentrations were generally lower, although similar among locations. Additionally, nitrate in hyporheic water was positively correlated with silica, an indicator of hyporheic residence time. A laboratory assay confirmed prior inferences that hyporheic microbial communities possess the functional potential to perform nitrification. Together, these findings suggest that remineralized autochthonous N accumulates in the hyporheic zone even as streamflow varies and likely subsidizes stream N availability, which supports prior inferences from N stable isotope data at this site. These results highlight the importance of hyporheic connectivity in controlling autochthonous N cycling and availability in streams.

AB  - Northern building envelopes must provide efficient indoor-outdoor connections based on photobiologicalpsychological needs of occupants for positive relationships with the sub-Arctic nature, particularly daylighting and day/night cycles. Envelope configurations of Northern Canada's buildings have not yet considered such requirements. Potentials of adaptive systems are also still limited. This research develops a fundamental model of adaptive multi-skin envelopes for sub-Arctic buildings based on main biophilic and photobiological indicators which characterize efficient indoor-outdoor connections. Biophilic indicators characterize the state of connections among occupants and outdoors which could stimulate biological-psychological responses. Photobiological indicators determine human-centric lighting adaptation scenarios for hourly lighting qualities and sufficient darkness in relation to local day/night cycles and daylighting. Biophilic performance of the proposed envelope was evaluated through 18 numerical models in terms of impacts of window and shading sizes on occupants' field of views. Photobiological lighting performance was evaluated by experimental methods using 23 physical models at 1:10 scale. Surface characteristics of dynamic shading panels, including color, reflectance, orientation, and inclination, were studied for potential photobiological impacts in terms of melanopic/photopic ratios and color temperatures. Results show that the proposed envelope could (i) offer acceptable direct visual connections with the outdoor nature through efficient window sizes for biophilia, and (ii) modify daylighting qualities to address hourly/seasonal photobiological needs of sub-Arctic occupants. Challenges of the proposed envelope to implement under sub-Arctic climatic conditions are underlined especially in terms of energy issues. The research outcomes help architects and decision-makers to improve occupants' wellbeing and healthy buildings in subArctic climates.

AB  - Through binding of mineral particles and elements, glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) plays a critical role in sustaining terrestrial soil quality and contributes to the fate of elements from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems. There is little knowledge, however, of the metal sequestration patterns of GRSP in both terrestrial and aquatic soils, and this limits progress in understanding how environmental conditions influence GRSP characteristics. Here, we employed microcosm experiments to determine the molecular composition of original GRSP derived from three arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Glomus intraradices, Glomus versiforme and Acaulospora laevis. To gain insight into the metal sequestration patterns of environmental GRSP, we investigated major subtropical and tropical mangrove wetlands in southern China. GRSP-bound metals were significantly and positively correlated with total metals, and the metal binding contributed to the metal sequestration of mangrove soils. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy results showed that original- and environmental GRSP fractions contained hydroxyl, carboxyl, amide and carbonyl functional groups, which enhanced metal binding. Environmental process had no effect on the type of functional groups of the GRSP, while it significantly changed the relative content of the functional groups. The infrared fingerprint analyses of original- and environmental GRSP revealed field-specific, however, no taxon-specific characteristics of GRSP. Biostatistical analysis of the GRSP molecular composition further revealed that the soil pollution sources regulated the ratios of functional group contents associated with hydrocarbons, proteins, polysaccharides and nucleic acids. By GRSP infrared fingerprints coupled with multivariate analyses, we developed a technique for source identification of heavy metal pollution, giving more reliable evidence about contributing sources.

AB  - Theory and empirical findings predict that individuals in a negative affective state are more sensitive to unexpected reward loss and less sensitive to unexpected reward gain compared to individuals in a neutral or positive affective state. We explore the use of sensitivity to reward shifts measured during successive contrast tasks as an indicator of affect in zebrafish (Danio rerio). In line with the assumption that exposure to rewarding stimuli induces a relatively positive affective state compared to exposure to stimuli that they do not prefer, we confirmed that zebrafish prefer enriched over barren environments, suggesting that the enriched environment is associated with positive affective states. We trained individuals to swim down a channel for food rewards of differing value and then presented them with unexpected increases or decreases in reward value. Contrary to our hypothesis, individuals conditioned to a high-value reward continued swimming at the same speed when reward value was downshifted, thus showing no successive negative contrast effect and appearing insensitive to reward loss. Individuals whose rewards were upshifted gradually increased their speed, but did not display successive positive contrast effects typical of sensitivity to reward gains. In both cases, housing type did not result in differences in swim time. One potential explanation is that goal-directed control of behaviour is necessary for an animal to show a successive contrast response to unexpected reward gain or loss, and the behaviour of zebrafish in this task was under habitual control, perhaps due to over-training. If so, refinements to task design and training procedures will allow further progress with this assay.

AB  - The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model is recognized as one of the top hydrological models applied for addressing hydrologic and environmental issues. This is the first review on the SWAT model studies in Southeast Asia, with an emphasis on its applications, current challenges and future research directions. A total of 126 articles were identified since 2006; roughly 50% of these studies were conducted in Vietnam or Thailand. About 16% of the studies were performed at a transnational scale, which included Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Vietnam. Model capability assessment, land use, and climate change assessment are the main SWAT applications that have been reported for the region. Most of the SWAT calibration and validation results for these studies were classified as satisfactory to very good results based on widely recognized performance indicators. However, the parameterization, calibration and validation procedures are not well reported in some articles. Availability of reliable data is one of the main problems that SWAT users are confronted with, as these data are either not freely available or restricted from public access in some countries. Hence, future studies should be considered on identification and development of reliable input data for SWAT modeling. SWAT model modification based on the SEA climate, geographical and land use conditions is another research direction to be considered in the future. Moreover, application of SWAT for extreme events simulation requires more attention in this region.

AB  - The Laptev and East Siberian seas which are generally viewed as terrestrial organic matter (TerrOM)-dominated seas, are among the least biologically understood regions in the Arctic Ocean. During the summer of 2013, however, the TerrOM signature was negligible in our samples. We investigated the biochemical composition (carbohydrates [CHO], proteins [PRT], and lipids [LIP]) of phytoplankton-dominated particulate organic matter in order to improve our understanding of the physiological status of resident phytoplankton. Our chlorophyll-a values and the presence of SCMs and resting spores were associated with a cessation of the phytoplankton bloom. Despite the low inorganic nitrogen nutrients in the water column, the cellular PRT (39%) were comparable to CHO (42%) contents and the inorganic (dissolved nitrogen:dissolved phosphate) and organic (PRT:CHO) indices did not indicate a nitrogen stress of phytoplankton metabolism. Altogether, the phytoplankton were likely in a growth transition from the exponential to the stationary phase, resulting in CHO-dominated cells with moderate PRT. By comparing our biochemical analyses with the LIP-dominated (>50%) ones in the Chukchi Sea (the summers of 2011 and 2012), we conclude that more severe nitrogen-limited conditions occurred in the Chukchi Sea. In a quality aspect, we suggest that consumers which feed on LIP-rich phytoplankton could have an advantage to overwinter while those feeding on CHO-rich phytoplankton will gain energy efficiently in a short term. Therefore, the biochemical composition of phytoplankton could be a valid integrator of surrounding environments in which phytoplankton grow and can be a good indicator of their nutritional value.

AB  - Effective and efficient assessments of the site conditions are required for the sustainable management of landfills. In this study we propose an evaluation method to determine the degree of environmental contamination by the contest of heavy metals (HM) concentrations in soil and plants (Tanacetum vulgare L., Carduus L., Plantago major L.). We compared HM concentrations in the soil, leaves, stem and roots of those native plants. Content of HM in samples was at the same level in all localities, except content of Zn. These values confirm that the area is not naturally burdened by increased HM content in the soil, and also that the deposited municipal waste or the material used for reclamation and composting does not contain risk elements. The content of selected HM was monitored in plants naturally occurring in the area of interest. We can state that the content of individual HM was in the plant biomass at the same level. The measured values confirmed that the largest number of HM was in roots, then in stem and the least in leaves. In addition, specific indexes were determined: BAC, TF, CF, PLI and I-geo. The BAC values confirmed that the individual plants had the ability to accumulate Pb and Cd (BAC> 2) but were limited to bind Mn and Zn (BAC <1). TF values confirmed that plants had a different ability to transport HM from roots to aboveground biomass. Potential soil contamination was detected using CF, PLI and I-geo indexes but contamination by HM was not confirmed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Functional diversity can be defined as the distribution of trait values within a community. Hence, functional diversity can be an indicator of habitat filtering and a reliable environmental predictor of ecosystem functioning. However, there is a serious lack of studies that test how functional diversity indices change depending on the environmental conditions. The aim of this study is to provide such evidence by analyzing the distribution and variation of continuous body-mass values (i.e. functional diversity) and related shifts in body length and width in a nematode community.
   We used a large online dataset on nematode traits to analyze: (i) the distribution of body mass using three functional diversity indices, i.e. functional richness, functional divergence and functional evenness; (ii) the shifts in body-size traits (length and width); and (iii) the body-mass distributions of five trophic groups and of the entire nematode community.
   Managed grasslands exhibited the widest range of body-mass values while body-mass distribution in arable fields covered the greatest area in comparison to the other ecosystem types. The shift in body size revealed environmental filters that could not have been identified by the study of functional diversity indices per se. We found low values of functional evenness to be associated with high values of functional richness. We provide novel empirical evidence that body-mass distribution within a trophic group mirrors the effects of habitat filtering more than the distribution in the community as a whole. Hence, our trait-based approach, more than functional diversity itself, disclosed soil food-web structure and identified community responses. (C) 2018 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

AB  - The impacts of Conservation Agriculture (CA) practices on soil characteristics have been largely studied. However, changes in soil electrical properties induced by CA cropping systems have been rarely studied for soil electrical conductivity (EC), and have never been reported for soil redox potential (Eh). Electrical conductivity is a key parameter and is largely used in precision agriculture to characterize various soil properties. Conversely, soil redox potential (Eh) has been overlooked by agronomists despite its being able to provide essential information to characterize soil conditions. This study set out to characterize the changes in soil electrical properties (Eh, pH and EC) induced by CA practices. For four contrasting soil types, varying in texture, pH and organic matter content, we showed that CA alters soil electrical activity (characterized by Eh corrected to pH(7) or pe + pH) and soil electrical conductivity. Fields under CA or conventional practices displayed reversed soil profiles for electrical activity: surface soil (0-5 cm) was found to be more oxidized under conventional systems than under CA practices, while the lower horizon (15-25 cm) was more oxidized in CA systems than in conventional systems. CA systems also decreased electrical conductivity when it was initially high, and increased it when it was low, especially in the surface horizon (0-5 cm). We discuss the possible mechanisms explaining such changes, the possible implications in the global functioning of soil/plant/microorganism system, and the interests and opportunities to use soil Eh-pH-EC as an indicator of soil health.

AB  - The Vercelli district is one of the most technologically advanced rice cultivation areas in the world, but the sector is causing serious environmental problems. This study aimed to acquire information on the ecological impact during conversion from conventional to organic farming, using the nematode community as an indicator of soil quality. An organic farming system managed with a 5-year crop rotation, based on rice (4-years) and soybean (1-year), was compared, during the fourth and fifth year after conversion, with conventional and integrated farming systems, both based on monoculture of rice. The relationship between soil biology and the type of farming system was explored by examining the nematode community, assessing maturity, plant parasitic, basal, enrichment, structure, channel indices and diversity-weighted abundance. No significant differences in total soil organic C, total N and C/N ratio were found between the management systems. Total nematode abundance was not strongly affected by the conversion, but the response of the nematodes to change varied with the trophic groups, year by year. The conversion from conventional to organic farming represented a disturbance factor. The introduction of the soybean crop determined a marked change in nematode composition; the persistent nematode population was only 20%, while the colonizer reached 80%. The indices showed that the nematode community varied between the farming system; in both years maturity index was lower in organic than in other management systems. Higher values of pH, C/N ratio and available P favoured basal and channel indices, while total N was negatively correlated.

AB  - Research on urban climates has been an important topic in recent years, given the growing number of city inhabitants and significant influences of climate on health. Nevertheless, far less research has focused on the impacts of light pollution, not only on humans, but also on plants and animals in the landscape. This paper reports a study measuring the intensity of light pollution and its impact on the autumn phenological phases of tree species in the town of Zvolen (Slovakia). The research was carried out at two housing estates and in the central part of the town in the period 2013-2016. The intensity of ambient nocturnal light at 18 measurement points was greater under cloudy weather than in clear weather conditions. Comparison with the ecological standard for Slovakia showed that average night light values in the town centre and in the housing estate with an older type of public lighting, exceeded the threshold value by 5 lux. Two tree species, sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and staghorn sumac (Rhus typhina L.), demonstrated sensitivity to light pollution. The average onset of the autumn phenophases in the crown parts situated next to the light sources was delayed by 13 to 22 days, and their duration was prolonged by 6 to 9 days. There are three major results: (i) the effects of light pollution on organisms in the urban environment are documented; (ii) the results provide support for a theoretical and practical basis for better urban planning policies to mitigate light pollution effects on organisms; and (iii) some limits of the use of plant phenology as a bioindicator of climate change are presented.

AB  - Arsenic and Cadmium concentrations in Todarodes pacificus (4 males and 4 females), Sepia longipes (1 male and 3 unknown), five Sepia madokai caught in 2012 (1 male and 4 females) and five S. madokai caught in 2014 (5 females) were collected from the East China Sea (ECS) during intervals from 2010 Oct. through to 2014 Oct. The internal organs were vacuum dried and the elements were measured by ICP-MS. Among the toxic elements, As, Cd, and Hg in the digestive gland, gonads and bronchial hearts of squids and cuttlefishes were measured separately. The squid T. pacificus practically inhabits offshore, whereas cuttlefishes, such as S. longipes and S. madokai, inhabit bottom coastal waters in the ECS. Cd concentration in digestive gland of T. pacificus and S. madokai is higher than similar species from other regions. This high concentration seems to be derived from anthropogenic activities and geological conditions present in the ECS. The squid and cuttlefish also accumulate high amounts of As, not only in their digestive gland but also in other organs. Arsenic could be derived from high volcanic activities. In the case of Hg, the muscles were reported to contain the highest concentration in the species studied, but unlike concentration of Cd in digestive gland, it was high compared to other studies. These elements can be utilized as indicators for environmental pollution in marine systems. For monitoring of harmful elements in squids and cuttlefish, for example Cd and As in the digestive gland and Hg in mantle should be measured.
