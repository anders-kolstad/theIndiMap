AB  - The present study simulated large-scale indoor mold damage in order to test the efficiency of air sampling for the detection of microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs). To do this, a wallpaper damaged by condensation was stored in a climate chamber (representing a hypothetical test room of 40m3 volume) and was inoculated with 14 typical indoor fungal strains. The chamber ventilation conditions were adjusted to common values found in moldy homes, and the mold growth was allowed to continue to higher than average values. The MVOC content of the chamber air was analyzed daily for a period of 105 days using coupled gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). This procedure guarantees MVOC profiling without external factors such as outdoor air, building materials, furniture, and occupants. However, only nine MVOCs could be detected during the sampling period, which indicates that the very low concentrated MVOCs are hardly accessible, even under these favorable conditions. Furthermore, most of the MVOCs that were detected cannot be considered as reliable indicators of mold growth in indoor environments.

AB  - In order to test the viability of oil sands aquatic reclamation techniques, yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were stocked into three experimental ponds. Pond substrates consisted of either oil sands fine tailings or clay and lean oil sands deposited by the mining operations. Yellow perch were stocked immediately postspawning and subsamples were sacrificed at 5 and 11 months to measure indicators of energy storage and utilization. These indicators included survival, age, spawning periodicity, condition factor, gonad size, fecundity, and liver size. Indicators generally showed patterns consistent with improved energy storage and utilization in the experimental pond yellow perch as compared with yellow perch in the lake from which the stocked fish originated. This was evidenced by increased gonad size, condition factor, and Liver size and the disappearance of spawning periodicity. The patterns observed in experimental ponds suggest improved resource availability and (or) reduced intra- and interspecific competition. Yellow perch physiological indicators were also compared with those measured at several remote natural lakes in the area. Fisheries parameters measured in yellow perch from the experimental ponds generally fell within the range of those found in natural lakes.

AB  - Hydrogen isotopic composition of n-alkanes was measured in sediments from an excavated profile of the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation in Liaoning Province, NE China, aiming to assess the significance of the delta D value of n-alkanes in ancient lacustrine sediments as the indicator for determining the source inputs of organic matters and paleoclimatic conditions. The delta D values of n-alkanes are in the range of -250% to -85% and display an obvious three-stage variation pattern through the profile, which is consistent with the distribution of the dominated n-alkanes and the profile of their delta C-13 values. The delta D and delta C-13 values of n-alkanes suggest that short-chain n-alkanes are primarily derived from photosynthetic bacteria and algae; n-C-29 and n-C-31 are mainly originated from terrestrial higher plants; n-C-28 and n-C-30 may be derived from the same precursor but via the different biological mechanism of hydrogen isotopic fractionation; while the source inputs of medium-chain n-alkanes are more complicated, with n-C-23 being derived from some specific algae or biosynthesized by various aquatic organisms. The paleoclimatic conditions are reconstructed via two approaches. The reconstructed hydrogen isotopic values of lake water and meteoric water (expressed as delta D-LW and delta D-MW, respectively) were at the intervals of -51.8% to 17.0% and - 118.1% to -43.5%, respectively, indicating a general climate transition from semi-arid to arid. The calculated Delta delta DLW-MW values vary from 37.0% to 89.1% and display a similar but a significant large-scale variation trend with the Delta delta DC23-long (-28.8% to 85.0%; long represents long-chain n-alkanes) and Delta delta Dmid-long (-15.4% to 43.4%; mid represents medium-chain n-alkanes) values. The discrepancy may be attributed to the source input overlap for n-alkanes and the uncertainties of ewater/lipid values. The coupling of Delta delta DC23-long, Delta delta Dmid-long and Delta delta DLW-MW values with the paleoclimatic evidence indicates that the delta D values of n-alkanes could be more sensitive to the change of paleoclimatic conditions.

AB  - To assess the current status of surface waters, it is necessary, as a first step, to have a system that includes a set of criteria for classifying and describing each existing surface water body. In this article, a new river typology system for Chile based on the Water Framework Directive of the European Union is shown. This system was created following a top down and a priori approach and was based on an accurate review of scientific literature, interviews and workshops with experts in Chilean aquatic ecosystems. The system consisted of five ecoregions (large areas with homogenous hydrological and climatic conditions) and a set of abiotic criteria with their classes. It was assumed that each abiotic criterion was a control factor for freshwater ecosystems. It is expected that this system will organise knowledge about the biocenosis distribution of the Chilean freshwater ecosystem and also provide an operative tool for water quality monitoring based on biological indicators.

AB  - To study the relationship between zooplankton community structure and environmental factors and water quality in the Harbin Section of the Songhua River, investigations were carried out in June, August, and October 2011. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and saprobic indices were used to process and analyze the data. Seasonal variability was identified as a significant source of variation, which explains the fluctuation in zooplankton density. In autumn, the dry season, water residence time increased and zooplankton biomass and abundance accumulated in the slow flowing waters. Zooplankton abundance increased when food conditions improved. Therefore, the total zooplankton abundance in autumn is much higher than that in spring and summer. According to the saprobic indices, all the sample sites had mesosaprobic water and water quality was worse in autumn. CCA revealed that temperature accounted for most of the spatial variation in the zooplankton community. Moreover, pH, dissolved oxygen saturation, and turbidity were important factors affecting zooplankton community distribution.

AB  - We aimed at evaluating the effect of low-level air pollution on leaf area fluctuating asymmetry (FAA) and specific leaf area (SLA) of Salix alba L, taking into account other environmental factors. Cuttings were grown in standardized conditions in the near vicinity of air quality measuring stations in Belgium. Variability of SLA and FAA between measuring stations explained 83% and 7.26%, respectively, of the total variability. FAA was not influenced by air pollution or environmental factors such as shading, herbivory, air temperature and humidity. SLA was increased by an increase in shadow, while NOx and O-3 concentrations had only a marginal influence. The influence of SO2 concentration was negligible. Although our data analysis suggests a relationship between SLA and NOx/O-3 concentration, the absence of a straightforward relationship between FAA and SLA and air pollution still questions the usefulness of these bio-indicators for monitoring air pollution.

AB  - The tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) fluorophore is a useful platform for fluorescence probes, being applicable, for example, to biological investigations utilizing fluorescence microscopy, owing to its excellent photochemical properties in aqueous media. We have developed new TMR derivatives that show different dependences of their behavior upon the environment. Among them, HMTMR showed unique characteristics, and its putative spirocyclic structure was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Utilizing this discovery, we have established a strategy to modulate the fluorescence of TMR by regulating the spirocyclization, and we have obtained a new fluorescence probe that can detect hypochlorous acid specifically. This probe, HySOx, can work in 99.9% aqueous solution at pH 7.4 and was confirmed to be able to detect hypochlorous acid being generated inside phagosomes in real time. HySOx is tolerant to autoxidation and photobleaching under bioimaging conditions. Regulation of the spirocyclization of rhodamines, as we describe here, provides a new approach to the rational development of novel fluorescence probes.

AB  - Sediment quality assessments for regulatory purposes (i.e. dredged material disposal) are characterized by linking chemical and acute ecotoxicological data. The design of chronic bioassays that incorporate more sensible endpoints than acute tests is discussed to address sediment quality for environmental quality assessment and regulatory proposes. The chronic tests use juveniles of commercial species of fish Spar-us aurata and Solea senegalensis, to assess sediment toxicity in samples collected along different littoral areas in the North and the South of Spain. The organisms were exposed during 60 days and sublethal endpoints were selected including biomarkers of exposure to metals (metallothioneins-MTs) and to organic contaminants (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity - EROD activity) and biomarkers of effect (histopathology in different tissues, gill and liver). A Multivariate Analysis Approach was conducted in order to associate these biological responses with sediment metal concentration from the ports and with chemical residues in biological tissues exposed to sediments under laboratory conditions.

KW  - GISP2
AB  - Pollen analyses of 85 samples from the Sanjiaocheng section well along the margin of a palaeolake at the end of the Shiyang River, NW China, show that Picea and Sabina dominate the pollen assemblage. Together they reach as high as 40%-60%, with the percentage of Picea varying inversely with that of Sabina. Similar results were obtained from another section in the Shiyang River drainage. Using modern ecological habitat relationship analogues, pollen transport characteristics, and the overall pollen assemblage, we propose that both Picea and Sabina pollen were transported by the river from the mountains at the upper reaches of the Shiyang River, and that the assemblage is more indicative of changes in upland vegetation than of local conditions near the section. This interpretation is supported by pollen data derived from surface samples, water samples, and riverbed samples. Using a moisture indicator (the Picea to Sabina ratio) and calculated pollen concentrations, we identify a series of palaeoenvironmental changes during the early Holocene (10-6.3 C-14 kaBP).

AB  - We have generated microbial sensors for analyzing the presence of various metals or metalloids by recombinant DNA technology. The strains are based on strictly regulated promoters controlling the expression of the firefly luciferase gene in microbial cells. The regulator-reporter constructs are located in shuttle plasmids capable of replicating in gram-negative or -positive microbial organisms. The sensors developed are real-time indicators of metal responsive gene expression giving results in approximately 30 min, with optimal induction times ranging from 60 to 240 min. We describe here the performance of these metal sensing bacteria for the assessment of different water samples spiked with lead, arsenic, mercury or cadmium. We show that these bacteria are sensitive detectors of metal bioavailability, which is difficult or even impossible to measure by traditional analytical chemistry methods. All measurements were done using freeze-dried bacteria, which makes these sensors reagent-like and also easy to use in field conditions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Phototransformation of the widely used benzodiazepine pharmaceuticals diazepam and human metabolites nordiazepam, temazepam and oxazepam under simulated sunlight in water was investigated. Photolysis experiments were conducted in the presence and absence of humic acids. Half-lives for each of the benzodiazepine pharmaceuticals were <200 h (under all conditions) suggesting that phototransformation is an important process for such chemicals in the photic zone of receiving waters. Due to the observed phototransformation of the benzodiazepines, significant emphasis was placed on identification of the photoproducts. A total of fourteen photoproducts, including benzophenones, acridinones and quinazolinones or quinazolines was identified and measured by liquid chromatography-multistage mass spectrometry (LC-MSn). Phototransformation studies were also undertaken on authentic samples of two of the identified photoproducts, 5-chloro-methylaminobenzophenone and 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone, in order to establish the phototransformation pathways. Interestingly, these two photoproducts showed relatively higher persistence than some of the benzodiazepines, suggesting that the fate and effects of photoproducts should also be incorporated into future risk assessments and environmental models of the fate of benzodiazepines.

AB  - The membrane lipid ergosterol is found almost exclusively in fungi, and is frequently used by environmental microbiologists as an indicator of living fungal biomass, based on the assumption that ergosterol is labile, and therefore rapidly degraded after the death of fungal hyphae. We studied the degradation of ergosterol in environmental samples without living fungi. Under the conditions used in this Study, ergosterol was very stable both when added as a pure compound and when associated with dead fungi. The decrease of ergosterol was at most 34% during 2 months when protected from sunlight. Presence of a natural bacterial assemblage did not enhance degradation over this time period, as compared to sterile controls. However, photochemical degradation was significant, and led to a 43% decrease of in ergosterol content during 24 h. These results suggest that ergosterol should be used cautiously as a biomarker for living fungi. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Intense research is being carried out on climate variability and change and the estimation and detection of anthropogenic effects. In addition to statistical methods, the use of plants, as biological indicators is becoming more popular as they are sensitive to environmental conditions. In this article we compare maps of the flowering dates of the locust tree (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) for three different time intervals between 1851 and 1994. The maps revealed noticeable shifts of dates, of approximately 3-8 days, towards earlier flowering. This change is related to the average temperature of spring (15 March-15 May), via a simple statistical model that is accurate enough to be able to quantify phenological changes and to calculate the corresponding warming. The model developed can estimate spring mean temperature using phenological data from R. pseudoacacia L. with an accuracy of 0.2 degrees C. Estimates of mean temperature based on phenological changes are compared to climatic series. This comparison emphasizes the possibility of using R. pseudoacacin. L. as a bio-indicator. Estimates of temperature changes are also given.

AB  - The optimisation of water purification with biological activated carbon (BAG) is described. Procedures are suggested to control biofilm growth and to use bio-indicators to predict TOC (total organic carbon) and COD (chemical oxygen demand) removal efficiencies. Empty bed contact time (EBCT) was a major physical control parameter. Dissolved oxygen (DO), pH and nutrients of the influent were controlled according to the abundance of bacteria, protozoa and rotifers. Numbers of micro-organisms in BAC beds were determined. Certain genera of ciliated protozoa, representing healthy environmental conditions, were employed as biological indicators for system performance during biological regeneration of exhausted granular activated carbon (GAG). There was a strong positive correlation between the abundance of some protozoa in the liquid phase of the BAC bed and COD concentration in the effluent. Mathematical spreadsheet models were constructed to estimate COD removal efficiency of BAC filters with different loading rates, DO, pH, nutrient requirements and populations of micro-organisms.

AB  - The walls of many deep-sea foraminiferal tests contain abiogenic and biogenic, precipitated and agglutinated, components. Both environmental and genetic factors can contribute to the great diversity in test form and composition in benthic foraminifera. Yet, small specimen size and the remoteness of the deep-sea environment have limited our ability to describe the relative influence of these biological and chemical factors. The use of fossilized foraminiferal tests as paleo-indicators requires that we understand the controls on test composition. Test wall morphology and composition were examined in foraminifera that colonized experimental substrates deployed on a seamount in the central North Pacific. Three types of agglutinated forms were identified. A triserial (Eggerella-like) and two-chambered (Hyperammina-like) form contained a Ca-rich (CaCO(3)) precipitate and the chamber walls of an encrusting two-chambered form was Ba-rich (BaSO(4)). We discuss the composition of these biologically precipitated minerals in the context of the environmental conditions during the life of these foraminifera.

AB  - Punta de Piedras Lagoon is a coastal lagoon located south of Margarita Island, in the Venezuelan Caribbean Sea. This lagoon has ecological and economic importance for the inhabitants of nearby communities. Currently, the urban and industrial development in its surroundings represents a potential source of pollutants, providing concentrations of nutrients that could affect the ecological balance of the area. The trophic status of Punta de Piedras Lagoon was evaluated using various trophic indices. The concentrations of chlorophyll -a and nutrients (ammonium, nitrites, nitrates, and orthophosphates) were estimated in 10 stations with a monthly frequency from February 2005 to January 2006. These data were used to estimate the trophic condition based on the Karydis and TRIX trophic indices, and by comparison with Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development reference values. It was found that Punta de Piedras lagoon presented mesotrophic conditions in most of the water body having considerable differences between indices. The values of the closest station to Paseo Esther Gil corresponded to eutrophic waters. However, the circulation and residence time of water allow an exchange with the adjacent sea, which prevents the eutrophication process in the lagoon.

AB  - The main objectives of this study were to develop a Water Quality Index (WQI) model based on the physicochemical parameters in Daecheong reservoirs by using datasets of 1995-2016. The parameters included total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), chlorophyll (CHL), electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO) and hydrogen ion concentrations (pH). The results had showed that physicochemical parameters varied spatially and temporarily as well as were correlated. TP was the most important key regulating factor for chlorophyll growth in the reservoirs. Seasonal summer TP influenced the autumn algal growth. The concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) was highest during the summer season (36 +/- 2 mu gL(-1)) while it was lowest in the winter season (15 +/- 1 mu gL(-1)). Summer monsoon directly influences the concentrations of total phosphorus in the reservoirs. Overall, the calculated WQI value suggested that site 1 (129.44) was in poor condition whereas sites 2 (116.06), 3 (103.51), 4 (89.3), 5 (82.007) and 6 (90.22) were in fair condition.

AB  - In the way to reduce costs in the poultry production, high densities of birds are adopted in the production systems. Such high densities can lead to an inappropriate environment, compromising the welfare and decreasing the animal performance. In this work we aimed to evaluate the effects of different densities on the productive yield, egg quality and immunological aspects of Japanese quails. It was used 816 Japanese quails, during egg production phase, in a random design, with four treatments (121.43 cm(2)/bird; 106.25 cm(2)/bird; 94.44 cm(2)/bird and 85.00 cm(2)/bird) with six repetitions each. Results indicate density did not interfere on egg quality and all treatments can be considered excellent, once the Haugh Unit was 88.03. Therefore, higher densities decline the yield, decreasing the eggs weight (10.35 g), the laying percentage (88%), egg mass (9.16 g) and the week average feed consumption (157.35 g). IgY values were higher at smaller cage density, suggesting birds in this condition presented better immunological condition, related to welfare and stress factors, all linked to immunoglobulins IgY.

AB  - The exposure of plants to multiple stress conditions can cause over production of reactive oxygen species promoting an imbalance in the redox system. The aim of this study was to examine the antioxidant response from varieties of sugarcane under adverse conditions, to understand the defense mechanisms of tolerant and sensitive genotypes. Micropropagated sugarcane of six genotypes, RB966928, RB98710, RB855453, RB99395, RB867515, and RB855156, were subjected to isolated action of high-temperature stress and a combination of water and saline stress, and effects were evaluated. Activities of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), as well as stress indicators such as lipid peroxidation (MDA content) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content were evaluated. The RB867515 variety showed synchrony between the enzymatic activity and ROS regulation and detoxification, in the plant cell under environmental stress situations, thereby ensuring the maintenance of the relative water content without increment of lipid peroxidation; and consequently, the maintenance of physiological processes and plant growth. These results indicated that lipid peroxidation associated with relative water content can be good biochemical markers of sensitivity to multiple stresses in sugarcane.

AB  - Tape cycling experiments were performed with a Travan(TM) linear tape system using metal particle (MP) media. The effects of various environmental conditions, particularly water content, on the tribology of the head/tape interface were studied. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to characterise the chemical and physical surface changes that occurred at the head surfaces. Transfer of material from the media to the head was observed at each condition. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to identify the chemical changes that occurred at the media surface. This showed that in all areas of the tape, the amount of detected iron had increased, while the nitrogen (binder indicator) signal had decreased. Significant differences in elemental concentrations were also detected between areas directly in contact with the cartridge drive belt compared to those not in contact. Pole tip recession (PTR) was around 50-65 nm after 5000 passes, but increased at the higher water contents. AES results showed that stain is a function of water content, not relative humidity. It was noted that a larger ceramic grain size seemed to increase PTR. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We review the conditions under which cross-sectional family data (e.g., data on twin pairs or adoptees and their adoptive and biological relatives) are informative about direction of causation. When two correlated traits have rather different modes of inheritance (e.g., family resemblance is determined largely by family background for one trait and by genetic factors for the other trait), cross-sectional family data will allow tests of strong unidirectional causal hypotheses (A and B are correlated ''because of the causal influence of A on B'' versus ''because of the causal influence of B on A'') and, under some conditions, also of the hypothesis of reciprocal causation. Possible sources of errors of inference are considered. Power analyses are reported which suggest that multiple indicator variables will be needed to ensure adequate power of rejecting false models in the presence of realistic levels of measurement error. These methods may prove useful in cases where conventional methods to establish causality, by intervention, by prospective study, or by measurement of instrumental variables, are infeasible economically, ethically or practically.

AB  - We combined fatty acid ( FA) and stable isotope (SI) analyses to investigate the trophic ecology of different stages of European eels (Anguilla anguilla) across seawater (SW), brackish water (BW), and freshwater (FW) habitats. Salinity was the main driver of differences in the biochemical composition, and the greatest variation occurred between SW and FW eels. SW eels had a higher content of the FA indicator of carnivory, as well as the highest stable isotope ratios (C, N). In contrast, FW eels exhibited the highest lipid content and omega-6 polyunsaturated FA, but the lowest stable isotope ratios, suggesting major dietary differences between the eels in these two habitats. While the biochemical composition of BW eels was closer to those of SW eels, BW eels had the largest SI range, indicating higher dietary plasticity. FW individuals had better overall condition compared to SW eels. Independent of habitat, larger individuals were in the best condition, and had higher lipid content and monounsaturated FA. These findings suggest a biological advantage for eels to maintain a catadromous life history strategy.

AB  - The requirement for environmental risk assessment (ERA) of genetically engineered (GE) plants prior to large scale or commercial introduction into the environment is well established in national laws and regulations, as well as in international agreements. Since the first introductions of GE plants in commercial agriculture in the 1990s, a nearly universal paradigm has emerged for conducting these assessments based on a few guiding principles. These include the concept of case-by-case assessment, the use of comparative assessments, and a focus of the ERA on characteristics of the plant, the introduced trait, and the receiving environment as well as the intended use. In practice, however, ERAs for GE plants have frequently focused on achieving highly detailed characterizations of potential hazards at the expense of consideration of the relevant levels of exposure. This emphasis on exhaustive hazard characterization can lead to great difficulties when applied to ERA for GE plants under low-exposure conditions. This paper presents some relevant considerations for conducting an ERA for a GE plant in a low-exposure scenario in the context of the generalized ERA paradigm, building on discussions and case studies presented during a session at ISBGMO 12.

AB  - A carbon-paste electrode for dicyclomine hydrochloride (DcCl) was prepared and fully characterized in terms of composition, life span, usable pH range and temperature. The electrode was applied to the potentiometric determination of dicylominium ion in its pure state and in pharmaceutical preparations in batch and flow injection conditions and in biological fluids using standard additions method. The electrode is based on a mixture of two ion-exchangers, namely, dicyclominium-phosphomolybdate and dicylominium-tetraphenylborate, dissolved in dioctyl phthalate as pasting liquid. The modified electrode showed a near-Nernstian slope of 58 +/- 2 mV over the concentration range of 1.2 x 10(-5) - 1.6 x 10(-2) M with an average recovery of 97 - 102% and a RSD of 0.090 - 1.00. The electrode exhibits good selectivity for DcCl with respect to a large number of inorganic cations, sugars, amino acids and organic substances of biological fluids. Potentiometric titrations of DcCl with several titrants have been monitored using this modified carbon paste electrode as an end-point indicator electrode.

AB  - The lower mid-littoral and shallow subtidal communities were studied in the district of Vlora (Albania), three years after the establishment of a Marine Protected Area, with particular attention to the long-lived species. The bioconstructions built in the mid-littoral zone by the calcified rhodobiont Lithophyllum byssoides were in poor condition and sometimes even dead. In contrast, the brown alga Cystoseira amentacea constituted lush stands. For assessing the ecological status of the studied area, the CARLIT method, based upon macroalgal communities, was applied. The observed range of ecological status was wide ('high' through 'bad') and was overall among the lowest assessed to date in the Mediterranean Sea. The occurrence of extensive sea-urchin barren grounds, though not taken into consideration by the CARLIT index, confirmed the poor condition of large sectors of the study area. Overall, the CARLIT index is well correlated with anthropogenic pressures, as assessed by the LUSI index. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The study deals with an outcrop of the Pabdeh Formation (Paleocene-Oligocene) in Bangestan Anticline, southern part of the Zagros orogcnic belt. The work on hand is an attempt to understand the formation of the Pabdeh boundary based on chemical changes in Zagros sedimentary basin area. Twelve fresh samples from Gurpi, Pabdeh, and Asmari were selected and chemically analyzed. Variation on both major and trace elements generally reveal high peaks of their frequencies in the lower and upper borders of the Pabdeh Formation. This border is different from the border which was determined from the earlier studies. These variations illustrate that the stratigraphic age reduction in the boundary of expected deposition time is based on the present data that the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (K-T) had started lower than the stratigraphic limit. Geochemical ratios, including Ni/Co, V/Cr, and V/(V+Ni) were used to diagnose the Palco-environmental conditions of Pabdeh Formation in comparison to Gurpi and Asmari formations. These chemical indicators suggest variable pal eoredox conditions for the Pabdeh Formation.

AB  - Hsp70 protein in three tissue types (gill, liver, and muscle) from black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri) collected in a highly variable estuarine environment was investigated to determine which tissue provides better intersite discrimination. The usefulness of hsp70 expression to identify anthropogenic stress under field conditions was evaluated. Intersite differences were detected in hsp70 levels in gill and white muscle of black bream while liver showed no spatial difference. There was high interfish variability in hsp70 levels in each tissue group. A post hoc power analysis of the datasets for each tissue found that in black bream, white muscle provided the best discriminatory power to elucidate spatial variability. Only 11 fish per site are required to identify significant intersite differences in white muscle whereas for gill and liver tissues 14 and 21 fish per site, respectively, would be required. Because of high intertissue and interindividual variability, field measurement of hsp70 should be complemented by evidence of changes in other biomarkers of fish health.

AB  - The rehabilitation of contaminated sites is becoming a rising preoccupation which requires the knowledge of their past before realization of a suitable remediation. Physicochemical analysis must be realized jointly with the use of bioindicator organisms, which, owing to their bioaccumulation capacities, will reveal the bioavailability of metals in soils. Among terrestrial invertebrates, gastropods like Helix aspersa aspersa possess an important organotropism for metals in their digestive gland and they can be used in active biomonitoring. During in situ monitoring, two parameters are tested: growth and accumulation of Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cd, Ni, Pb, and Cr in viscera of snails. Environmental conditions, like humidity or autochthonous vegetation, are able to modify growth or bioaccumulation. In order to remove the variation of these factors, microcosms previously used must be improved: they were equipped with porous candles, which continually humidify soil. Concerning vegetation, an experimental plan was realized to determine the combination of food with the best compromise between growth and bioaccumulation: the combination clover-snail feed was chosen. Thus, in situ, the experimental environment will be repeated in all investigated sites and used to allow-follow up of their contamination levels and intercomparison between different sites.

AB  - Analyses of organic carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and iron have been performed in order to understand sources and preservation of organic matter in black shale of the Buxin Formation (Early Paleogene) from the Sanshui Basin. The ON ratios show that the organic matter is characterized by a mixture of terrestrial and phytoplanktonic contributions. The relative importance of different sources depend on climate conditions and most of organic matter is of terrestrial origin. The relationships between C, S and Fe indicate that the brackish environment with alternation of anoxia and low-O-2 developed in the bottom waters during the deposition of these organic-rich sediments as a result of a mixed setting of thermal stratification and salinity stratification, the latter being the consequence of intermittent sea water incursion. Bacterial sulfate reduction is the most effective early diagenesis affecting the preservation of organic matter. The intensity of sulfate reduction is related to the relative proportion of metabolizable organic matter supplied to sediments.

AB  - Sound environmental management relies on scientific evidence to indicate whether action is warranted and, if so, which actions will be most effective. We discuss conceptual model diagrams that schematically describe how sources or human activities lead to specific stressors and ultimately to biotic effects. They are useful for describing how undesirable effects are produced and identifying where management actions may be most effective in preventing unwanted effects or improving existing conditions. We illustrate the use of conceptual model diagrams in a literature -based assessment of the impacts of mountaintop removal mining on downstream aquatic systems. The diagram-development process combined extraction and evaluation of research results with iterative refinement of diagrams depicting source-to-stressor-to-effect causal pathways. Conceptual -model diagrams provided a useful scaffold for organizing and synthesizing multiple individual pieces of evidence extracted from different studies and an effective way to summarize and present the evidentiary foundation of the assessment's conclusions. Key words: conceptual models, evidence, environmental assessment, evidence synthesis, literature -based, mountaintop removal mining.

AB  - Flow difficulties during handling, storage, and processing are common in cereal grain-based powder industries. The many studies that focus on the flow properties of powders can be classified as flow indicators, shear properties, and dynamic flow properties. The non-uniformity of physical and chemical characteristics of the individual particles that make up the bulk solid of cereal grain-based powders adds complexity to the characterization of flow behavior. Even so, knowledge of flow behavior is critical to the design of productive and cost-effective equipment for handling and processing of these powders. Because many factors influence flow, a single property/index value may not satisfactorily quantify the flow or no-flow of powders. For powders of biological origin, chemical composition and environmental factors such as temperature and relative humidity complicate flow characterization. This review focuses on the specific flow characteristics that directly affect powder flow during handling, processing, and storage. (c) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Biodiversity is frequently seen as an indicator of ecological health. Therefore a survey of the macroinvertebrates of the Olifants River, one of the most polluted rivers in South Africa, was conducted in 2010-2011. Four surveys were conducted at a total of seven sampling sites in four ecoregions, Highveld-Upper, Highveld-Lower, Lowveld-Lower and Eastern Escarpment mountain range, using sweepnets to sample vegetation and substratum. Conductivity, pH and temperature were measured in situ. Macroinvertebrates were identified to family level and counted. Ninety-four taxa were collected, of which 12 were each represented by more than 1% of the total number specimens collected. The influence of abiotic factors on biodiversity was assessed through canonical correspondence analysis, species richness, Shannon-Wiener index and Pielou's evenness index. Ecoregion and associated temperatures played dominant roles in the distribution of families. Although the level of organic enrichment at some sites could benefit families tolerant to, or with a preference for, such conditions, this proved insufficient to exclude the less-tolerant families from those sites.

AB  - Hard data alone are not sufficient to evaluate local police effectiveness in the new age of community policing. Citizens can provide useful feedback regarding strengths and weaknesses of police operations. However, citizen satisfaction indicators typically fail to accurately convey the multidimensional nature of local policing and account for characteristics that are non-controllable for the local police departments. In this paper, we construct a measure of perceived effectiveness of community oriented police forces that accounts for both multidimensional aspects of local policing and exogenous influences. In specific, this paper suggests the use of a multivariate conditional, robust order-m version of a non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis approach with no inputs. We show the potentiality of the method by constructing and analyzing perceived effectiveness indicators of local police forces in Belgium. The findings suggest that perceived police effectiveness is significantly conditioned by the demographic and socioeconomic environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The chestnut gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus is a global pest of chestnut (Castanea spp). Established as a pest in the mid-twentieth century in Japan, Korea and North America, this species was first reported in Europe in 2002. Following the successful release of a biological control agent Torymus sinensis in Japan, this parasitoid species has been released in Italy since 2005. Here we discuss the potential of T. sinensis as a viable management option for the biological control of D. kuriphilus in central Europe. We suggest that more consideration should be given to determining, (i) the conditions under which T. sinensis may attack alternative native gall wasp hosts and (ii) the likelihood of hybridization of this species with native Torymus. Both issues are central to predicting unassisted range expansion by released T. sinensis, and to assess the environmental risks associated with a more widespread release of this species in Europe.

AB  - The survival of faecal and total coliform bacteria and Streptococcus faecalis (indicator bacteria) were monitored in experimental plots receiving various amounts of biological or dephosphatation municipal sewage sludge. Biological sludge was applied on coniferous and mixed regenerative forest soils. The results show that except for total coliforms, there was little significant treatment effect on the indicator bacteria numbers in all of the sires. In most cases, there was a significant time effect, indicating that bacterial populations vary over time, according to environmental factors such as temperature, moisture or nutrient level conditions. In total coliform bacteria, populations varied over time but also in function of treatment levels. The present study suggests that even if the standards of Quebec (Canada) for sludge application are respected, there may be some risk for bacterial contamination depending on the types of sewage sludge and forest habitat. Although there is only a short-term effect, high slopes can influence the movement of the indicator bacteria and may potentially cause some contamination problems.

AB  - Simple Summary Obesity and its associated complications, such as metabolic syndrome, are an increasing problem in both humans and horses in the developed world. Adipose tissue is a key endocrine organ that communicates with other organs by multiple endocrine substances called adipokines. There is evidence to suggest that adipokines may contribute to the regulation of biological processes, such as metabolism, immunity, and inflammation. The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of one of these adipokines in horses, resistin, and its relationship with insulin dysregulation (ID) and inflammation. Seventy-two horses, included in one of the four following groups, were studied: healthy controls, horses with inflammatory conditions, horses with mild, and horses with severe ID. Plasma resistin concentrations were significantly different between groups, and the highest values were recorded in the inflammatory and severe ID groups. The lack of correlation of resistin with basal insulin concentration and the significant correlation of resistin with the inflammatory marker serum amyloid A suggest that, as is the case in humans, plasma resistin concentrations in horses are predominantly related to inflammatory conditions and not to ID. Obesity and its associated complications, such as metabolic syndrome, are an increasing problem in both humans and horses in the developed world. The expression patterns of resistin differ considerably between species. In rodents, resistin is expressed by adipocytes and is related to obesity and ID. In humans, resistin is predominantly produced by inflammatory cells, and resistin concentrations do not reflect the degree of obesity, although they may predict cardiovascular outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of resistin and its relationship with ID and selected indicators of inflammation in horses. Seventy-two horses, included in one of the four following groups, were studied: healthy controls (C, n = 14), horses with inflammatory conditions (I, n = 21), horses with mild ID (ID1, n = 18), and horses with severe ID (ID2, n = 19). Plasma resistin concentrations were significantly different between groups and the higher values were recorded in the I and ID2 groups (C: 2.38 +/- 1.69 ng/mL; I: 6.85 +/- 8.38 ng/mL; ID1: 2.41 +/- 2.70 ng/mL; ID2: 4.49 +/- 3.08 ng/mL). Plasma resistin was not correlated with basal insulin concentrations. A significant (r = 0.336, p = 0.002) correlation was found between resistin and serum amyloid A. Our results show that, as is the case in humans, plasma resistin concentrations in horses are predominantly related to inflammatory conditions and not to ID. Horses with severe ID showed an elevation in resistin that may be secondary to the inflammatory status associated with metabolic syndrome.

AB  - Public institutions purpose to provide public products and services in order to meet the social needs of natural and legal persons, on conditions of economic efficiency. The fair performance evaluation, on a given model, with a well-determined evaluation system was accepted as a large requirement, both by researchers and practitioners. The research aims to develop a theoretical framework for evaluating the performance of the local public sector (municipalities) from the end users point of view, in accordance with the new tendencies, respectively of replacing the classical approach, oriented towards the service providers, by orienting towards the beneficiaries' needs, who are the citizens and the business environment. The paper introduces an evaluation system that includes indicators identifying the extent to which the public sector responds to the needs of citizens, indicators through which it is determined the degree to which the public services provided by the municipality meet the citizens' requirements, in various sectors, as well as a set of indicators used to measure the performance, employed in companies, accommodated to the specific nature of the public sector.

AB  - Most of the hypersaline lakes located in the arid part of the Crimea have been undergoing anthropogenic transformations. We concentrate on the impact of the established water storage reservoir on the marine Kyzyl-Yar Lake (Western Crimea) over the period from 1985 to 2017. As a result of water seepage from the reservoir, the lake salinity decreased from 162 g/L in 1985 to 2-3 g/L in 2005 and subsequently remained steady at this level. Over 20 years, the lake changed from a hypersaline to freshwater lake. The accompanying changes included an altered ratio of ion concentrations in the water column and interstitial waters and increased Ca2+/Na+ and indicators. Substantial shifts occurred in the structure of the biological diversity and conditions of the bottom deposits, such as the disappearance of branchipoda crustaceans of the genus Artemia, which had been practically the only representative of the local fauna before, and the dominance of new species Cladocera and Cyclopoida in plankton.

AB  - Complex social-ecological systems models typically need to consider deeply uncertain long run future conditions. The influence of this deep (i.e. incalculable, uncontrollable) uncertainty on model parameter sensitivities needs to be understood and robustly quantified to reliably inform investment in data collection and model refinement. Using a variance-based global sensitivity analysis method (eFAST), we produced comprehensive model diagnostics of a complex social-ecological systems model under deep uncertainty characterised by four global change scenarios. The uncertainty of the outputs, and the influence of input parameters differed substantially between scenarios. We then developed sensitivity indicators that were robust to this deep uncertainty using four criteria from decision theory. The proposed methods can increase our understanding of the effects of deep uncertainty on output uncertainty and parameter sensitivity, and incorporate the decision maker's risk preference into modelling-related activities to obtain greater resilience of decisions to surprise.

AB  - There is an extensive literature on chrysophyte stomatocysts from diverse habitats and their use as paleolimnetic indicators of past environmental conditions in lakes. The majority of these cysts are unidentified, and more laboratory studies are needed to link stomatocyst morphotypes to vegetative stages. A laboratory procedure that resulted in stomatocyst production in the chrysophyte alga Ochromonas pinguis (Chrysophyceae) was tested to determine if the protocol would also stimulate the production of stomatocysts in six other chrysophytes. Chrysolepidomonas dendrolepidota, Chrysosaccus cf. sphaericus, Dermatochrysis sp., Synura cf. americana, Synura cf. macropora and a second species of Ochromonas all produced stomatocysts within two to three weeks. Morphology of the stomatocyst was described using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This was the first report of stomatocysts from Chrysosaccus and the first SEM description of O. pinguis cysts. These autecological studies provide a greater linkage between sediment stomatocysts and their biological origin, strengthening the interpretive value of these microfossils and broadening our understanding of chrysophyte biogeography.

AB  - Fluorescent protein-based indicators for intracellular environment conditions such as pH and ion concentrations are commonly used to study the status and dynamics of living cells. Despite being an important factor in many biological processes, the development of an indicator for the physicochemical state of water, such as pressure, viscosity and temperature, however, has been neglected. We here found a novel mutation that dramatically enhances the pressure dependency of the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) by inserting several glycines into it. The crystal structure of the mutant showed that the tyrosine near the chromophore flipped toward the outside of the beta-can structure, resulting in the entry of a few water molecules near the chromophore. In response to changes in hydrostatic pressure, a spectrum shift and an intensity change of the fluorescence were observed. By measuring the fluorescence of the YFP mutant, we succeeded in measuring the intracellular pressure change in living cell. This study shows a new strategy of design to engineer fluorescent protein indicators to sense hydrostatic pressure.

AB  - Land ecological suitability refers to the land-use suitability of ecological conditions for a particular area. This paper introduced the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to assess ecological suitability for urban land use, to increase the assessment reasonableness and accuracy by solving the continuity interrupt of the evaluation data and reflecting the fuzziness of the evaluation classification levels. Two sample sets were applied to verify the accuracy and validity of the proposed ecological suitability assessment model. The results demonstrated that the ecological suitability level obtained by the SVM model was stricter than that by the traditional model, which was conducive for environment protection. Additionally, the SVM model could effectively eliminate the adverse effect caused by the long evaluation classification interval and the phase step of the two sides of the cut-off point, which improved the rationality of the assessment results for land use. The SVM model can provide sound management decisions for urban land-use planning and ensure the sustainable usage and development of land resources.

AB  - An inventory of the current Balearic plants occurring in mesophyllous environments, with climatic conditions similar to those in the first half of the Holocene, was compiled. The presence of these floristic elements, extending mainly into the postglacial time, has been related to pollen records of different localities in the Balearic Islands. GIS techniques have been applied in order to map the past and the present-day vegetation suitability of some of these mesophyllous species using pollen surface samples, forest inventory data and Digital Climatic Models. We integrated the information provided by field survey, pollen records and suitability mapping in order to discuss the vegetation dynamics of different habitats. We focused on the nature and the possible causes of the vegetation landscape change that occurred approximately 5000-6000 uncal. years BP, when Fagus, Corylus and Buxus formations were replaced by xeric-type formations with Olea dominance.

AB  - Background and objective: One of the main causes of bacterial resistance to antimicrobials is multidrug resistance induced by the increased efficiency of the efflux pumps. In this study we analyzed how the conditions of assay affect the efflux of indicator substrates ethidium (Et+) and tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) in Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium cells. Impact of the outer membrane permeability barrier, composition and temperature of the medium on accumulation of the indicator compounds also was analyzed.
   Materials and methods: The fluorescence of Et+ and Nile Red was measured using 96-well plates and a plate reader. In parallel to traditional studies of fluorescence we applied a constructed selective electrode to follow the accumulation of Et+ in S. enterica cells. Simultaneously with monitoring of Et+ concentration in the cell incubation medium, electrochemical measurements of TPP+ accumulation were performed. Furthermore, Et+ and TPP were used within the same sample as agents competing for the interaction with the efflux pumps. An inhibitor phenylalanyl-arginyl-beta-naphtylamide (PA beta N) was applied to evaluate the input of RND-family pumps in the total efflux of these indicator compounds.
   Results: S. enterica cells with the intact outer membrane (OM) bound very low amounts of Et+ or TPP+. Cells with the permeabilized OM accumulate considerably higher amounts of the indicator compounds at pH 8.0, but only Et+ was considerably accumulated at pH 6.5. At conditions of electrochemical monitoring accumulation of Et+ by the permeabilized cells at 37 degrees C was considerably faster than at 23 degrees C, but at the higher temperature most of the cell accumulated Et+ was extruded back to the medium. The fluorescence of Et+ in suspension of cells incubated in 400 mmol/L Tris buffer was about twice higher compared to 100 mmol/L one. The inhibitory action of TPP+ on Et+ efflux was evident only in 400 mmol/L Tris although PA beta N effectively increased Et+ fluorescence at both buffer concentrations.
   Conclusions: Results of our experiments indicate that ionic strength of the incubation medium influence the selectivity, the medium temperature and the assay conditions impact the kinetics of efflux. The lower accumulated amount and the weaker fluorescence of Et+ registered in slightly acidic medium indicate that Delta Psi plays a role in the accumulation of this indicator cation. The bound amount of Et+, to the de-energized or permeabilized cells considerably varies depending on the conditions and methods of de-energization or permeabilization of cells. Tris/EDTA permeabilization of the cells does not inhibit the efflux. (C) 2017 The Lithuanian University of Health Sciences.

AB  - An 1180-cm long core recovered from Lake Lyadhej-To (68 degrees 15' N, 65 degrees 45' E, 150 m a.s.l.) at the NW rim of the Polar Urals Mountains reflects the Holocene environmental history from ca. 11,000 cal. yr BP. Pollen assemblages from the diamicton (ca. 11,000-10,700 cal. yr BP) are dominated by Pre-Quatemary spores and redeposited Pinaceae pollen, pointing to a high terrestrial input. Turbid and nutrient-poor conditions existed in the lake ca. 10,700-10,550 cal. yr BP. The chironomid-inferred reconstructions suggest that mean July temperature increased rapidly from 10.0 to 11.8 degrees C during this period. Sparse, treeless vegetation dominated on the disturbed and denuded soils in the catchment area. A distinct dominance of planktonic diatoms ca. 10,500-8800 cal. yr BP points to the lowest lake-ice coverage, the longest growing season and the highest bioproductivity during the lake history. Birch forest with some shrub alder grew around the lake reflecting the warmest climate conditions during the Holocene. Mean July temperature was likely 11-13 degrees C and annual precipitation-400-500 turn. The period ca. 8800-5500 cal. yr BP is characterized by a gradual deterioration of environmental conditions in the lake and lake catchment. The pollen- and chironomid-inferred temperatures reflect a warm period (ca. 6500-6000 cal. BP) with a mean July temperature at least 1-2 degrees C higher than today. Birch forests disappeared from the lake vicinity after 6000 cal. yr BP. The vegetation in the Lyadhej-To region became similar to the modem one. Shrub (Betula nana, Salix) and herb tundra have dominated the lake catchment since ca. 5500 cal. yr BP. All proxies suggest rather harsh environmental conditions. Diatom assemblages reflect relatively short growing seasons and a longer persistence of lake-ice ca. 5500-2500 cal. yr BP. Pollen-based climate reconstructions suggest significant cooling between ca. 5500 and 3500 cal. yr BP with a mean July temperature 8-10 degrees C and annual precipitation-300-400 mm. The bioproductivity in the lake remained low after 2500 cal. yr BP, but biogeochemical proxies reflect a higher terrestrial influx. Changes in the diatom content may indicate warmer water temperatures and a reduced ice cover on the lake. However, chironomid-based reconstructions reflect a period with minimal temperatures during the lake history. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - We analyzed Al, Ti, Fe, Mn, Cu, Ba, Cd, U, Mo, V, and Re in water column, settling particulate, and sediment (0 to 22 cm) samples from the intense oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) of the eastern tropical North Pacific near Mazatlan, Mexico. The goal was to determine how the geochemistry of these elements was influenced by suboxic water column conditions and whether the sediments have a unique "suboxic" geochemical signature.
   The water column was characterized by a Mn maximum, reaching similar to8 nmol kg(-1) at 400 m. Concentrations of Cu, Ba, Cd, Mo, Re, U, and V were unaffected by the low 02 conditions and were comparable to those of the open ocean. Sinking particles were composed of lithogenic particles of detrital origin and nonlithogenic particles of biogenic origin. Al, Ti, and Fe were mostly (at least 79%) lithogenic. About 75% of the Mn was nonlithogenic. Significant amounts (at least 58%) of Cu, Ba, Cd, and Mo were nonlithogenic.
   Sediment geochemistry varied across the continental shelf and slope. Cadmium. U, and Re have prominent maxima centered at 310 in, with 12.3 ppm, 10.9 ppm, and 68.3 ppb, respectively, at the core top. High values of Mo (averaging 6.8 ppm) and V (averaging 90 ppm) are seen in OMZ surface sediment. Additional down-core enrichment occurs for all redox-sensitive elements in the top 10 cm. For U. Mo. V, and Re, surface sediments are a poor indicator of metal enrichment. Comparison of the nonlithogenic composition of sediments with sinking particles suggests that direct input of plankton material enriched in metals makes a significant contribution to the total composition, especially for Cd. U. and Mo.
   We evaluated Re/Mo and Cd/U ratios as tracers for redox environments. Rhenium and Mo concentrations and Re/Mo ratios do not lead to consistent conclusions. Concurrent enrichments of Re and Mo are an indicator of an anoxic depositional environment, In contrast, high Re/Mo ratios are an indicator of suboxic conditions. Cadmium is enriched in surface sediments, while U has considerable down-core enrichment. The concentrations of Cd and U and the Cd/U ratio do not follow patterns predicted from thermodynamics. Though the water column is suboxic, these four redox-sensitive elements indicate that the sediments are anoxic. The implication for paleostudies is that a trace metal sediment signature that indicates anoxic conditions is not necessarily attributable to an anoxic water column.

AB  - The modulation of some immunological and/or physiological parameters, as a response to stressful conditions, may function as an important indicator of health status especially in cultivated animals such as shrimps, where a rapid and precise assessment of health conditions is crucial to ensure the success of culture programs. In this study, we investigated the alteration of some hematoimmunological parameters in the shrimp Farfantepenaeus paulensis after exposure to one of the following stressful conditions: (a) low salinity (22parts per thousand and 13parts per thousand), (b) unilateral eyestalk ablation in females and (c) spermatophore extirpation in males. The investigated parameters were: the total hemocyte count (THC), total serum protein concentration (PC), phenoloxidase (PO) activity and agglutinating activity of the serum. At low salinity, the shrimp hemograms (THC) were systematically lower (up to 40% in shrimps maintained for 2 weeks at a salinity of 13parts per thousand) than in control animals (47,312 +/- 5510 cells/mm(3)). Also, in destalked females and spermatophore-extirpated males, the THC was 56.3% and 63% lower, respectively, than that of control animals (52,159 +/- 12,692 cells/mm(3) for females, 48,241 5236 cells/mm(3) 3 for males). Similarly, PC was approximately 50% lower in destalked females and spermatophore-extirpated males, when compared with control shrimps (125 23 mg/ml for females, 151 +/- 16.6 mg/ml for males). On the other hand, the PC of shrimps maintained in low salinity did not show such a pronounced decrease. The specific PO activity, after trypsin treatment, increased significantly in the serum of spermatophore-extirpated males (43.3 +/- 4.2 and 26.5 +/- 2.1 U/min/mg in extirpated and control males, respectively), but not in destalked females. On the other hand, a clear correlation between PO activity and water salinity was not observed in this study. Interestingly, PO activity (total and specific) markedly decreased in all tested salinities in the last 2 weeks, suggesting a partial suppression of the prophenoloxidase (proPO) system probably due to the stress caused by captivity. The agglutinating activity of F. paulensis serum against sheep erythrocytes was extremely variable, even within treatments, and there was no apparent correlation with the stress agents. Among the investigated hemato-immunological parameters, THC and PC were the most sensitive parameters to stress conditions and could be virtually incorporated in shrimp cultivation programs, following technique standardization.

AB  - Hydrological methodologies are the most efficient approaches for environmental flow (eflow) assessments. This paper presents a hydrological methodology for determining eflows in rivers with scarce development to promote proactive environmental water allocations that limit flow alteration and unsustainable water use. The analysis includes the natural intra-annual and inter-annual ranges of flow variability. Eflows are determined based on four hydrological low-flow conditions and a flood regime. The main contribution is that the flow regime components are adjusted to a four-tiered environmental objective class system based on a novel "frequency-of-occurrence" approach. The method is applied in three rivers in western Mexico with highly variable flow regimes. The eflows are largely (96%) within the central range of previous implementations, and the outcomes reveal an overall good and acceptable level of the method's performance (for 83% of the cases R (2) >= 0.84, slope = 1 +/- <= 0.2), consistent with supporting indices of flow variability.

AB  - Lake Sanabria is a Spanish lake that holds the largest volume of water in the country. It is a terminal moraine, monomictic, acidic lake that is typically oligotrophic to oligo-mesotrophic. The current situation of the lake was assessed using phytoplankton data from the growing seasons of 2013. In addition, data from the 1980s were used to evaluate any variation from former conditions. The planktonic communities were analyzed using biomass measurements (Chlorophyll-a and biovolume) and several composition metrics (IGA, PTSI, PTI and IGA2). Considering the applicable Spanish legislation for ecological quality assessment, the ecological status in 2013 was High. According to both the biomass and composition metrics, no change in the trophic status was apparent, although there was some evidence of a shift in species contribution to biomass from the 1980s samples to the current ones. The shift from cyanobacterial taxa to diatoms was one of the changes observed, but this does not necessarily imply a change in the trophic status.

AB  - In this paper an identification and selection of Environmental Performance Indicators (EPIs) in port areas has been conducted. A comprehensive inventory of existing EPIs in use in the seaport sector has been identified for monitoring performance of operational (e.g. dust, noise, dredging, and waste), managerial (e.g. certification, compliance, and complaints) and environmental condition (e.g. air, water, sediment and ecosystems). These indicators have been filtered against specific criteria and have been assessed and evaluated by port stakeholders in order to obtain a final set of indicators suitable to be implemented at EU level. A user friendly tool has been developed specifically to assist port authorities in calculating and reporting the proposed indicators. This study has drawn on major research projects to blend academic research with input from marine professionals in order to identify, select, evaluate and validate EPIs that are acceptable and feasible to the sector, and practicable in their application and implementation.

AB  - The coastal waters at many beaches in California and the United States are afflicted with fecal pollution, which poses a health risk for people exposed to the water through recreational activities such as swimming, surfing, and diving. Identifying sources of pollution is complicated by oceanographic transport/mixing processes and the nonconservative behavior of microorganisms exposed to sunlight and hostile marine conditions. This article investigates the variation of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations in the surf zone and the adjacent coastal marsh by applying autocorrelation and cross-correlation analyses that illustrate solar and tidal modulations. A steady state bioreactor model was developed to explain solar inactivation in the surf zone, whereas a dynamic model was applied to explain tidally influenced disturbances in the coastal marsh. These models applied to intensive monitoring datasets on FIB and environmental variables have provided insights into the biologic and physical processes controlling coastal water quality, specifically the influence of sunlight and tides on bacterial levels.

AB  - Topographic and meteorological conditions make the Columbia River Gorge (CRG) an 'exhaust pipe' for air pollutants generated by the Portland-Vancouver metropolis and Columbia Basin. We sampled fog, bulk precipitation, throughfall, airborne particulates, lichen thalli, and nitrophytic lichen distribution. Throughfall N and S deposition were high, 11.5-25.4 and 3.4-6.7 kg ha(-1) over 4.5 months at all 9 and 4/9 sites, respectively. Deposition and lichen thallus N were highest at eastern- and western-most sites, implicating both agricultural and urban sources. Fog and precipitation pH were frequently as low as 3.7-5.0. Peak NOx, NH3, and SO2 concentrations in the eastern CRG were low, suggesting enhanced N and S inputs were largely from particulate deposition. Lichens indicating nitrogen-enriched environments were abundant and lichen N and S concentrations were 2 x higher in the CRG than surrounding national forests. The atmospheric deposition levels detected likely threaten Gorge ecosystems and cultural resources. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Over the past 20 years there has been a concerted effort to define and limit the impacts of anthropogenic contaminants in aquatic environments.  There are essentially two philosophies that can be employed to regulate and to assess the effects of toxic chemicals in these systems.  The first is the water quality objectives research.  Under this protocol, laboratory research is used to set an objective, the concentration of a substance or condition that is considered to have no effect on the organisms in an aquatic environment based on a review of the pertinent research.  The second approach, environmental health assessment, uses the in situ responses of free-living organisms in contaminated environments to determine the overall impacts of the environment on those organisms.  In this review paper we will attempt to compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches, and to outline a system whereby they can be used together to enhance our degree of confidence in legislation directed at reducing contaminant impacts.

AB  - The lower Cambrian black rock series in eastern Yunnan province is a high-quality shale gas reservoir with great prospect for oil-gas exploration. However, the depositional conditions and mechanisms of organic matter enrichment are not well understood. In this study, geochemical characteristics of total organic carbon (TOC) and major and trace elements of fourteen black rock series samples from Dahai outcrop in eastern Yunnan province are systematically investigated to analyze the paleoenvironment and their effects on organic matter enrichment and established the accumulation model of organic matter. Results show that TOC contents of the four lithologic units of Qiongzhusi Formation black rock series are 0.70, 0.34, 1.77, and 0.27, respectively, which suggests that TOC content is generally low (mean = 0.51%). The main elements show that P2O5, CaO, and MgO are relatively rich, whereas other elements depleted. The enrichment factors (EFs) of trace elements showed that Pb and Zn are highly enriched in all samples, and Cu, Sr, Ba, U, Mo, V, Be, and Mo are also enriched in different lithofacies units. The elemental anomalies may be related to hydrothermal activities, which may lead to the distortion of some paleoenvironmental indicators to some extent. The Rb/Sr and Sr/Cu values show that the palaeoclimate gradually changed from dry to humid. Al concentrations indicate a gradual increase in terrigenous detritus supply. The hydrodynamic conditions and sedimentation rates implied by Zr/Al and Ti/Al values correspond well with lithology and grain size. Based on the comprehensive analysis of B/Ga and Sr/Ba ratios, it is considered that the black rock series in Qiongzhusi Formation was mainly formed in brachial water. Multiple paleoredox indicators (e.g., Ni/Co, V/Cr, U/Th, and V/(V+Ni) ratios) suggest that the sedimentary environment is mainly oxidized, which is usually considered unfavorable for organic matter preservation, and it also forms carbonaceous shale (unit 3) in a dysoxic environment. The Mo/TOC ratios suggest that the sedimentation during Qiongzhusi Formation period was under restricted conditions. The paleoproductivity indicated by P/Ti, Ni/Al and Ba-bio values decreased gradually from medium level to low level. In summary, relatively high paleoproductivity is a prerequisite for organic matter accumulation and less terrigenous debris supply, and relatively arid climate and reductive conditions are favorable for the preservation of organic matter.

AB  - Practice shows that professional adaptation is adaptation to the content, conditions and nature of a specific professional activity through the organization of professional applied physical training. According to the federal state educational standards of higher education, applied physical training is taught in the last semester of the discipline; universal competencies are formed as the goals and results of education. However, at present, it can be stated that, first, adolescents have a slow physical development. Second, physical conditions are different in terms of performance. Third, there is a decrease in the number of students with an average physical condition. In such conditions, it is necessary to update the existing system of applied training for a most specific increase in the range of adaptive capabilities of the body, for the formation of professionally important qualities, and, as a result, of professional adaptation. To achieve this aim, the author has developed the concept of applied physical education (APE), a pedagogical process of professional applied physical training towards the development of professionally important physical and personal qualities using a set of interrelated principles, approaches, and methods of physical culture within the modern federal state educational standards of higher education. A hypothesis has been put forward: professional adaptation to the future professional activity of students will be more successful if we use the APE methodology with the inclusion of applied training in each even (2, 4, 6) semester to reduce the period of adaptation. Taking into account that the formation of adaptation, including professional adaptation, goes through three stages: (1) urgent "initial" - adaptation to physical activity; (2) long-term - structural changes in the body due to the accumulation in the body of the effects of repeated urgent adaptation; and ( 3) stable adaptation. The indicators characterizing each of the stages were compared. The author compared the indicators of 40 students of South Ural State University (experimental group) and 39 students of South Ural State Institute of Arts (control group). At the first stage, the methods of functional tests were used: Serkin's Test and the Martine-Kushelevsky test; at the second stage, the stabilometry method was used; at the third stage, the PWC170 and VO2max express method was used. The study clearly demonstrates that, if the pedagogical process of professional applied physical training uses the author's methodology of applied physical education in accordance with the methodological principles (systematicity, complexity, practical orientation, graduality, accessibility, unity, and interconnection), the experimatal group sufficiently (p<0.05) increase the range of adaptive capabilities of the body and better form professionally important qualities.

AB  - Fisheries compete with seabirds for vanishing marine resources, but also produce fishery waste consumed by seabirds. Marine birds may therefore avoid or seek fishing vessels, and have evolved complex, plastic behavioural responses to vessel presence. Understanding these responses is essential to the conservation of a globally declining seabird community. We studied Cape gannets (Morus capensis), which compete with fisheries for reduced sardine (Sardinops sagax) resources in the Benguela upwelling region off South Africa. Using bird-borne GPS trackers coupled with newly-developed ship-radar detectors we show that foraging gannets seldom attended fishing vessels. Rather, they switched from eating scarce sardines or energetically-poor fishery waste to targeting locally abundant saury (Scomberesox saurus). This pelagic fish is brought into the seascape by warm water influx, and is not commercially exploited by fisheries. Cape gannets thereby show dietary plasticity, allowing them to maintain adult body condition and chick growth rates. This diet switch is a strong indicator that Cape gannets forage in an ecologically perturbed marine environment.

AB  - Stylasterids are azooxanthellate lace corals, which may show an unusual colouration in coral reef ecosystems, ranging from red to purple on the light-exposed side of their colonies. In the present study, it was discovered that the calcareous skeletons of such corals are actually invaded and eroded by cryptic carbonate boring algae that represent Conchocelis phases in the life cycle of bangialean rhodophytes. For the first time, the shape, organisation and distribution of Conchocelis filaments within the skeletons of two different genera of lace corals are reported and documented by light and electron microscopy. Such description and characterisation of Conchocelis can help to distinguish between morphologically and taxonomically different endolithic microorganisms penetrating coral skeletons, including their recognition in fossil borings as indicators of depositional depth, i.e. of the extent of the photic zone and light conditions in ancient marine environments. The results are discussed in the light of a possible symbiotic or parasitic relationship between Conchocelis phases and their stylasterid host corals.

AB  - Euglena gracilis (E. gracilis) has been proposed as one of the most attractive microalgae species for biodiesel and biomass production, which exhibits a number of shapes, such as spherical, spindle-shaped, and elongated. Shape is an important biomarker for E. gracilis, serving as an indicator of biological clock status, photosynthetic and respiratory capacity, cell-cycle phase, and environmental condition. The ability to prepare E. gracilis of uniform shape at high purities has significant implications for various applications in biological research and industrial processes. Here, we adopt a label-free, high-throughput, and continuous technique utilizing inertial microfluidics to separate E. gracilis by a key shape parameter-cell aspect ratio (AR). The microfluidic device consists of a straight rectangular microchannel, a gradually expanding region, and five outlets with fluidic resistors, allowing for inertial focusing and ordering, enhancement of the differences in cell lateral positions, and accurate separation, respectively. By making use of the shape-activated differences in lateral inertial focusing dynamic equilibrium positions, E. gracilis with different ARs ranging from 1 to 7 are directed to different outlets.

AB  - A simple experiment designed to study mixing of a material of complex rheology in a stirred tank is described. Non-Newtonian suspensions of blue maize flour that naturally contain anthocyanins have been chosen as a model fluid. These anthocyanins act as a native, wide spectrum pH indicator exhibiting greenish colors in alkaline environments, blue tones in neutral conditions, and pink violet colors in acid environments. Students used a continuous injection of a basic solution in an initially acidic environment to reveal mixing patterns and flow structures and to follow their evolution over time in a typical stirred tank configuration. These experiments aim to demonstrate, in a laboratory setting, basic concepts related to mixing: (i) the existence of mixing pathologies in laminar-stirred tanks; (ii) the complex rheology of some real suspensions; (iii) the effect of tank geometry on mixing performance; and (iv) the quantitation of mixedness and mixing evolution using digital color analysis.

AB  - Forest ecosystems are the source of multiple goods and services to humans, the provision of which is deemed to be conditioned by biodiversity. If so, the value of biodiversity has to become apparent to society and, especially, decision makers. The aim of this study was to demonstrate this value. Biodiversity changes were investigated along different stages of forest disturbance in the National Park "Fruska Gora". Both quantitative (structural diversity, species diversity) and qualitative aspects (functional traits of species) have been observed. Parallel analysis of the provision level of certain forest products, resulting from the given forest state, was performed and monetarily expressed. The results indicate that biodiversity lowers with higher disturbance. Moreover, benefits accrue with higher biodiversity. The approach also proved useful in estimating the ecosystem's ability to maintain its functionality; however, further exploration of these links will be needed. This is necessary in future work if biodiversity conservation incentives are to be created.

AB  - Due to economic importance of Guanabara Bay, a multidisciplinary approach was adopted to investigate 88 surficial sediment samples in order to use the benthic foraminifera as indicators for the characterization of environmental variations. Grain-size analyses indicate that bottom sediments of the inner part of the bay are mainly muddy while those close to the entrance of the bay are sandy. Geochemical data show high concentration of heavy metals mainly in the northern region of the bay. Micropalaeontological analyses indicate the boundaries of the areas with the highest concentration of heavy metals. The dominant benthic foraminifera in the bay are Ammonia beccarii and Buliminella elegantissima, taxa capable of differentiating the presence of pollutants of different sources. B. elegantissima, in particular, has shown to be an indicator of anthropogenic pollution. The study highlights the worsening of environmental conditions since 2000 and those areas of the bay in need of a priority recovery. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - During last years the sturgeon stocks from natural environment considerably diminished. re-establishing sturgeons stock through propagation and rearing in favourable conditions have become the objective of our researches. The experiment was conducted in a pilot scale recirculating system situated in the 'Recirculating aquaculture system engineering" laboratory of the 'Aquaculture and Fisheries' Department. The overall period of this experiment was 30 experimental days. Sturgeon growth performances were evaluated through analysis of various technological indicators: W (weight gain), FCR (food conversion ratio), SGR (specific growth rate), PER (protein efficiency ratio). The body profile was evaluated through allometric factor. Growth spore of the total biomass (the second variant) showed higher values - 532 g compared with the first variant - 350 g, values confirmed doubling of growth spore in personal growth variant (V2) - 13.14 g/ex from the original version (V1) - 7 g/ex, which can be explained by high growth rate greed feeding of beluga compared with the hybrid - bester.

AB  - Increasing coastal urbanization and shipping activity-related environmental pollution advocate the importance of assessment of port ecosystems. Fatty acid biomarkers, elemental components, and biopolymers were used to evaluate the composition of sedimentary organic matter and benthic trophic status of Kolkata (freshwater, enclosed docks) and Kandla (seawater, macrotidal) ports of India. The sediment fatty acid composition indicated relatively fresh and energy-rich organic matter of phytoplankton and bacterial origin inside Kolkata port than the outside riverine station and Kandla port. Biopolymeric carbon (BPC), used as an indicator of trophic status, revealed eutrophic condition in Kolkata port with high accumulation of organic matter of autochthonous origin, attributed to poor water flushing and input of anthropogenic wastes. In contrast, Kandla port was meso-oligotrophic, rich in bacteria, and terrestrial plant-derived materials. Such an assessment of ports' trophic status helps to evaluate the health of the ecosystem and in management practices.

AB  - Chrysophytes are sensitive to environmental changes in alpine peatlands, within which acidic and oligotrophic conditions favour the proliferation of chrysophytes. Previous investigations of chrysophyte stomatocysts in temperate and boreal regions provide basic knowledge on their morphology and distribution; however, subtropical areas have been less thoroughly explored. Twelve Sphagnum samples collected from three subtropical montane peatlands (central China) were analysed to reveal the morphotypes of stomatocysts in this less investigated region. Twenty-three morphotypes of chrysophyte stomatocysts were identified in these samples following the International Statospore Working Group (ISWG) guidelines, and illustrated by SEM and LM micrographs. They include nineteen previously described cysts and four newly described stomatocysts. The results of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that the cyst assemblage was related to depth to water table (DWT), pH, oxidation reduction potential (ORP) and electrical conductivity (EC). These results improve our knowledge of the taxonomy and autecology of stomatocysts, highlighting the potential of stomatocysts as bioindicators in peatlands.

AB  - Ecological suitability evaluation for hydropower development is effective in locating the most suitable area for construction and emphasizes a clear direction for water resources governance. In this paper, water footprints and transportation connectivity were introduced to improve the existing ecological suitability evaluation application for hydropower development by revising the defects of the traditional indicator system. The following conclusions were reached. (1) Tibet was in a state of water use surplus; the prospect of further hydropower development is positive. (2) Chamdo, Lhasa and Nyingchi excelled in water use efficiency, and Ali was placed last. Nakchu was slightly superior to Ali, but it lagged behind the southern regions. Lhasa, Chamdo, Nyingchi, Xigaze and Shannan were suitable for hydropower development, which could further meet local needs and benefit other regions of China. (3) The evaluation results were in accordance with the actual eco-environmental conditions of the built hydropower projects, indicating that current hydropower development planning was basically reasonable.

AB  - Stereotypic behavior is treated as an essential indicator of animals' welfare. The occurrence of this behavior stems from the dissonance between the conditions in which they are kept and those preferred by the animals and fulfilling their biological needs. The contemporary studies concerning this behavior involve both definitions and classifications of basic concepts associated with these types of disorders. The majority of those definitions characterizes stereotypic behaviors as being invariant, repetitive and with no obvious goal or function. The criteria are often equivocal or their meaning imprecise. The variety of forms and types of this behavior indicates that different types of stereotypes are the result of different disturbances in interactions between an animal and its environment. Difficulties to classify the types of stereotypical behaviors are the result of the equivocality of the criteria, thus one form can often be classified to many types. Some among the few classifications focus more on the frequency and intensity of symptoms, others on causes. Here we present a review of various definitions with the criteria being used to describe this abnormal behavior.

AB  - Prolonged dormancy (hereafter dormancy), a phenomenon in which a perennial herbaceous plant does not sprout for one or more years, is examined. The phenomenon may be more frequent than stated so far and discovery of its role in plant life history and performance is still underway. Data from published papers was reviewed and all known species exhibiting dormancy were analysed from the aspect of species ecological values. Adaptation to environmental factors (light, moisture, pH and nitrogen as estimated by Ellenberg indicator values) influences the maximum duration of dormancy. A higher proportion of plants are dormant in species that prefer to grow in good light conditions, dry sites and infertile soil. The duration of dormant period is longer in species that prefer to grow in dry sites and/or calcareous soils. A range of factors, we believe, control plant behaviour, however, it is suggested that environmental stress is the principal factor inducing dormancy.

AB  - The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) has implemented a phased approach to ecological risk assessment (ERA). The first step in this process is a screening-level ERA at each facility. Basic to this approach was the development of ecologically based screening levels (EBSLs), defined as concentrations of chemicals in soil (or other media) that are not expected to produce any adverse effects on selected ecological receptors under chronic exposure conditions (analogous to preliminary remediation goals or soil screening levels). EBSLs are calculated by rearrangement of standard exposure equations to solve for soil concentration when chemical intake rate is set at a developed toxicity reference value (TRV). A TRV is defined as a chronic dose that is likely to be without appreciable risk of deleterious effects, This definition was extended to define TRVs and ultimately EBSLs for the functional groups used in the INEEL screening-level ERAs.

AB  - A two-dimensional hydrodynamic model that couples hydrology and water quality processes was developed to simulate the concentrations of PAH in water phase and sedimentation rates of PAHs in marine environment. The kinetic processes of the model included atmospheric exchange, transportation, deposition, etc. Taking Liaodong Bay as an example, the pollution level, spatial distribution of PAHs in sediments were analyzed and the transport, transformation and sedimentation processes of PAHs were simulated. The results show that PAHs concentrations in sediments are at a "moderate risk" level, and the distribution has a conspicuous spatial variation. According to the results of simulation, the PAHs in sediments are easily accumulated with weak hydrodynamic conditions. Thus, hydrodynamic is one of the important factors affecting the spatial distribution characteristics of PAHs in the sediments. The PAHs numerical calculation model established in this paper and its evaluation results have important research value for PAHs pollution prevention and control.

AB  - Meiobenthic nematodes are well-known bioindicators in aquatic ecosystem health programs. However, the explored taxa are still limited and practically devoted to the community level. The present study provided a new method of experimental isolation of a species from a pristine nematofauna. In our method, the nematofauna faced two types of sediment, namely, the leaves ofPosidonia oceanicaand shells ofMytilus galloprovincialis, under controlled laboratory conditions, and several changes in species composition occurred through gradual selection of the most adaptable nematode taxa to the new environments, which were previously defaunated. We used the selected nematode taxon,Marylynnia puncticaudata(Cyatholaimidae), to examine the possible effects of organic enrichment, and the results clearly showed that the body size of the nematodes significantly increased and they became fat when after enrichment using a powder made of marine agar (1200 mg l(-1)) and cuticles ofCrangon crangon(900 mg l(-1)), but their relative body growth showed no discernible changes.

AB  - Biotic interactions shape the community structure and function of ecosystems and thus play an important role in ecosystem management and restoration. To investigate how water temperature (related to the season) and water depth (related to spatial patterns of river morphology) affect macrophyte-bacterioplankton interactions in a groundwater-fed river, we conducted the structural equation modeling on datasets grouped by hydrological conditions. In addition to direct effects on macrophyte growth and/or bacterioplankton development, water temperature and water depth could both regulate the role of different nutrients (inorganic and organic) on affecting these biological indicators. Deeper water depth intensified the positive relationship between macrophytes and bacterioplankton, while higher temperature switched the relationship from being positive to negative. Our study provides empirical evidences that abiotic variables, even with relatively low fluctuations, play a critical role in regulating the patterns and strengths of interaction between macrophytes and bacterioplankton.

AB  - Lichens have been used as biomonitors for multiple purposes. They are well-known as air pollution indicators around urban and industrial centers. More recently, several attempts have been made to use lichens as monitors of climate change especially in alpine and polar regions. In this paper, we review the value of saxicolous lichens for monitoring environmental changes in Antarctic regions. The pristine Antarctica offers a unique opportunity to study the effects of climate change along a latitudinal gradient that extends between 62 degrees and 87 degrees S. Both lichen species diversity and thallus growth rate seem to show significant correlations to mean annual temperature for gradients across the continent as well as to short time climate oscillation in the Antarctic Peninsula. Competition interactions appear to be small so that individual thalli develop in balance with environmental conditions and, as a result, can indicate the trends in productivity for discrete time intervals over long periods of time.

AB  - As well as companies that compete in market, in public health system organizations compete to satisfy customer's need, and therefore identifying those needs and delivering the value is critical in success. Return to Scale and Damage to Scale are measures. In this study data envelopment analysis is developed to measure the Return to Scale and Damage to Scale in public health organization. Two new assumptions for production possibility set are proposed as Weak Natural Disposability and weak managerial disposability. Then three types of models including efficiency evaluation, Return to Scale determination, and Damage to Scale determination are proposed based on radial and non-radial models. A case study is handled using real data of 33 hospitals in Tehran. Each hospital is assumed as a decisionmaking unit with 4 inputs, 2 desirable outputs, and 2 undesirable outputs. The proposed approaches are straightforward and applicable for real world problems.

AB  - As the primary producer in streams, periphyton plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling processes, and has been widely used as an indicator for stream assessment and management. This study examined altitudinal patterns of stream periphyton biomass and their relations to environmental variables in three tributaries of the Lancang-Mekong River. Total dissolved solids, conductivity, and water temperature related negatively with elevation in the three streams. Periphyton biomass showed distinct responses to environmental variables in three streams, and no environmental variables had significant relationship with periphyton biomass in all streams. Altitudinal patterns of periphyton biomass in three streams were uniform: it had a positive relation with elevation, showing a consistent trend with the anthropogenic impact. The altitudinal pattern of stream periphyton biomass could be an ideal indicator to assess stream ecological condition, and monitor anthropogenic impact on mountain streams in the Lancang-Mekong River system.

AB  - We investigated the effects of pharmaceuticals and pesticides detected in a Mediterranean river, on fluvial biofilms by translocation experiments performed under controlled conditions. Water was sampled from three sites along a pollution gradient. Biofilms grown in mesocosms containing relatively clean water were translocated to heavily polluted water. Several biofilm descriptors were measured before and after translocations. Fifty-seven pharmaceuticals and sixteen pesticides compounds were detected in river waters. The translocation from less to more polluted site was the most effective. Autotrophic biomass and peptidase increased while phosphatase and photosynthetic efficiency decreased. Multivariate analysis revealed that analgesics and anti-inflammatories significantly affected biofilm responses. Ibuprofen and paracetamol were associated with negative effects on photosynthesis, and with the decrease of the green algae/cyanobacteria ratio, while diclofenac was associated with phosphatase activity. The effects of these emerging compounds on biofilms structure and function may cause important alterations in river ecosystem functioning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A study was conducted to identify soil ecosystem metrics for use in monitoring soil ecosystem health in tropical montane cloud forest habitats, and to establish a baseline of soil community characteristics. This work was performed in six unique forested habitats on the Caribbean and Pacific slopes of the Monteverde Reserve in Costa Rica. Comparisons were made of the soil moisture, nitrogen fixation activity, microbial biomass, fungal and bacterial abundance and diversity, and the abundance of key functional genes laccase (for lignin degradation by basidiomycete fungi) and nifH (for bacterial N- fixation). Differences were found in these metrics between habitats, which were correlated with soil moisture. The results of this work show that these metrics can be used as part of a program to monitor the soil ecosystems for early indicators of shifts in conditions in response to environmental change within this part of a fragile ecosystem.

AB  - If no data are available for a specific radionuclide its analogue could be used in radioecological models. They might be used not only in the frame of screening modelling. Relevant processes and features have to be known, such as time scales of these processes, physical, chemical and biological properties of the environment and relevant media. An analogue could only be proven to be valid by comparing its behaviour in the conditions of interest, while confidence in the validity of an analogue will increase as the quality of the justification increases, there will always be some residual uncertainty. Several main types of analogy can be used when measured or recommended values are not available: the same parameter obtained for another isotope of the same element; the same parameter obtained for another element: a different parameter obtained for the same element. There are several cases, when analogues might be applied as indicators of the determining processes in the radioecological studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Microcosm studies have been carried out to find out the relative survival of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium in a tropical estuary. Survival has been assessed in relation to the important self-purifying parameters such as biotic factors contained in the estuarine water, toxicity due to the dissolved organic and antibiotic substances in the water and the sunlight. The results revealed that sunlight is the most important inactivating factor on the survival of E coli and S. typhimurium in the estuarine water. While the biological factors contained in the estuarine water such as protozoans and bacteriophages also exerted considerable inactivation of these organisms, the composition of the water with all its dissolved organic and inorganic substances was not damaging to the test organisms. Results also indicated better survival capacity of E coli cells under all test conditions when compared to S. typhimurium. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Freshwater mussels are one of the most endangered groups of animals and live in some of the fastest changing ecosystems in the world. Unfortunately, very little is known about how their life history and ecology are influenced by their environment, especially for lake-dwelling populations. In this study, we paired similar to 30 y of extensive environmental data to lifetime and annual growth rates of a population of Fatmucket mussels (Lampsilis siliquoidea) living in a cool-water oligotrophic lake in northern Wisconsin, USA. This population displayed one of the slowest growth rates and longest lifespans within its phylogenetic tribe (Lampsilini). Growth rates were highly variable between individuals and, in contrast to studies in other systems, not related to temperature, growing season, or any indicators of primary production. However, growth rates were positively correlated with changes in lake level. We hypothesize that mussel growth in this system is linked to landscape-level environmental conditions and allochthonous resource limitation.

AB  - In many lakes and reservoirs, Microcystis aeruginosa is one of the dominant bloom species. Five environmental factors, including nutrients and physical factors, were selected to evaluate their effects and interactions on the growth of M. aeruginosa (FACHB-905) by joint analysis in a laboratory batch culture. The results indicated that all five factors affected the growth rate alone or in combination, and that their interactions were complex. This cyanobacterium strain preferred higher water temperature and alkaline conditions, while not requiring high illumination or high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus. Owing to these features the bloom of this cyanobacterium appears easily in nature. The form of nitrogen (nitrate or ammonium) also affected the assessment of M. aeruginosa bloom. The possibility of M. aeruginosa bloom would still exist even if the phosphorus concentration in the water column was very low. The result provided a good basis for the analysis and prediction of M. aeruginosa blooms in terms of environmental assessment, because the joint analysis of multiple factors would offer more valuable information than a univariate analysis.

AB  - Sportfishing is a growing segment in the fishing sector, which requires the supply of marine shrimps to meet the demand for live baits; however, the extraction of white shrimp from their natural habitat results in overfishing depleting natural stocks. Intensive cultivation in water recirculation system is a worldwide trend for shrimp farming, which, in addition to increasing productivity, minimizes the impact of effluent emission on the environment, reinforcing sustainability. This study analyzed the economic viability of establishing farms for the cultivation of white shrimp (Litopenaeus schmitti) in water recirculation system to meet the market demand of sportfishing for live baits. The indicators were used: internal rate of return (IRR), net present value (NPV) and payback period (PP). The best scenario, with 90 % survival rate and unitary selling prices of US$ 0.50, showed IRR 11.74 %, NPV (10 %) US$ 1,241.88 and PP 5.71 years, demonstrating financial risk for the production of live baits in the conditions proposed in this study.

AB  - Current aquatic environmental risk assessment of plant protection products or biocides does not consider effects on organisms involved in leaf litter breakdown, a fundamental ecosystem process in streams. Therefore, direct ecotoxicological implications of tebuconazole, a frequently used triazole fungicide, on the leaf-shredding amphipod Gammarus fossarum, were assessed. While acute toxicity was low (96h-LC50 = 1347 mu g/L), feeding rate, a sublethal endpoint, was significantly reduced after seven days of exposure to 600 mu g/L. At the same concentration, but during a three week exposure under semi-static conditions, gammarids showed significant reductions in feeding, but also in assimilation and growth. At 200 mu g/L, however, only assimilation was significantly affected. As these endpoints can be used to evaluate the ecotoxicity of a broad range of chemicals and to deduce possible implications in the functioning of ecosystems, the inclusion of similar experimental set-ups might further improve aquatic environmental risk assessment.

KW  - REGIONS
KW  - TM
AB  - Current approaches to mapping submerged coral ecosystems by remote sensing techniques are largely confined to the identification of general reef features in shallow tropical waters, Technical difficulties in compensating for the attenuation of radiance through the water column, as well as an incomplete understanding about the specific spectral features of coral and other substrates under normal and stressed conditions, have limited mapping and assessment procedures, This paper reports on recent developments in mapping submerged coral assemblages in Fiji using remotely sensed imagery and in situ field measurements. Preliminary results indicate that the spectral response of corals can be determined up to a depth of 10 m. An accurate and replicable procedure is proposed to quantify the spectral response of various corals and other submerged substrates to determine biodiversity and stress indicators for mapping and assessing coral ecosystems at site-specific and regional locations. Applications of the approach in establishing baseline information, assessing environmental change and managing linked systems within an integrated coastal management framework are high-lighted.

AB  - Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) provides new opportunity for China to enhance the security of natural gas but with potential challenges. The objective of this study was to scientifically assess China's natural gas investment (NGI) along BRI so as to improve its investment performance. We used the super slacks-based measurement of efficiency (SE-SBM) method to construct a linear programming model for NGI performance considering the resource status, political situation, eco-tech environment, social conditions, market quality, and international cooperation. The mean value of NGI from 2003 to 2013 was used to classify countries along BRI into three clusters, namely high, middle and low efficiency zones. Combined with scale of returns and the dual price analysis of input factors, we put forward the improvement path of NGI in target countries in different zones.

AB  - The definition of sustainable forest management ISM in Israel is unique, because the majority of its forests are constructed and the availability of natural or historical forest references to serve as benchmarks is very limited. The aim of this article is to propose a definition and a suitable framework for the sustainable management of Mediterranean planted coniferous forests (MPCF) in Israel. We consider the unique historical and ecological characteristics of the MPCF and discuss their implications for SFM. We propose a list of indicators specifically designed to suit the MPCF and a framework for evaluating sustainability according to forest objectives. We discuss the possibility of adopting a more extensive management scheme based on natural processes of regeneration and succession. Our approach, which is based on the definition of forest objectives, on one hand, and the understanding of the local ecological and socioeconomical conditions, on the other hand, may be appropriate for SFM in other constructed forests throughout the world.

AB  - Landscape structure of Slovakia was assessed by application of CORINE land cover database. Inner heterogeneity of the individual land cover classes was analyzed by representation and nature of vegetation formations. This indicator along with natural, and especially geo-relief conditions made possible to estimate eco-stabilizing properties of the individual types of landscape structure in the context of their harmonious functioning. Landscape structure was divided by share of self-regulating properties and demand of societal regulation to three basic groups. Comparison of satellite data from the 1970's and 1990's brought information about landscape changes. Analysis of changes of landscape structure presented the the development and assessment of key landscape types in the context of sustainability. From the viewpoint of strategic decision-making and planning it is necessary to control the landscape changes and to plan the inputs into the environment and regeneration of renewable resources. This contribution was part of the information source for the preparation of the National Strategy of Sustainable Development in the Slovak Republic.

AB  - Background Psychopathology research is changing focus from group-based "disease models" to a personalized approach inspired by complex systems theories. This approach, which has already produced novel and valuable insights into the complex nature of psychopathology, often relies on repeated self-ratings of individual patients. So far, it has been unknown whether such self-ratings, the presumed observables of the individual patient as a complex system, actually displaycomplexdynamics. We examine this basic assumption of a complex systems approach to psychopathology by testing repeated self-ratings for three markers of complexity:memory, the presence of (time-varying) short- and long-range temporal correlations;regime shifts, transitions between different dynamic regimes; andsensitive dependence on initial conditions, also known as the "butterfly effect," the divergence of initially similar trajectories. Methods We analyzed repeated self-ratings (1476 time points) from a single patient for the three markers of complexity using Bartels rank test, (partial) autocorrelation functions, time-varying autoregression, a non-stationarity test, change point analysis, and the Sugihara-May algorithm. Results Self-ratings concerning psychological states (e.g., the item "I feel down") exhibited all complexity markers: time-varying short- and long-term memory, multiple regime shifts, and sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Unexpectedly, self-ratings concerning physical sensations (e.g., the item "I am hungry") exhibited less complex dynamics and their behavior was more similar to random variables. Conclusions Psychological self-ratings display complex dynamics. The presence of complexity in repeated self-ratings means that we have to acknowledge that (1) repeated self-ratings yield a complex pattern of data and not a set of (nearly) independent data points, (2) humans are "moving targets" whose self-ratings display non-stationary change processes including regime shifts, and (3) long-term prediction of individual trajectories may be fundamentally impossible. These findings point to a limitation of popular statistical time series models whose assumptions are violated by the presence of these complexity markers. We conclude that a complex systems approach to mental health should appreciate complexity as a fundamental aspect of psychopathology research by adopting the models and methods of complexity science. Promising first steps in this direction, such as research on real-time process monitoring, short-term prediction, and just-in-time interventions, are discussed.

AB  - Stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope (SI) values of sedimentary organic matter (SOM), seston and two dominant bivalves, Mytilus spp. and Macoma balthica, were studied at 18 stations along the European coast in spring and autumn 2004. Three main regions, the Baltic Sea (BS), the North Sea and English Channel (NS), and the Bay of Biscay (BB), were tested for possible geographic (latitudinal) differences in the SI values. In spring, only BS showed lower delta C-13 values of seston and Mytilus spp., and higher delta N-15 values of SOM, than NS and BB. No significant differences between the 3 regions were found in autumn. Irrespective of season and regions, Mytilus spp. was more C-13-depleted than M. balthica. delta C-13 values of M. balthica, but not those of Mytilus spp., were significantly correlated with SOM. These results are consistent with differences in feeding behavior of Mytilus spp. and M. balthica, as the two species are known as obligatory-suspension and facultative-deposit feeders, respectively. In contrast, no differences in the delta N-15 values of Mytilus spp. and M. balthica were found at individual stations, indicating the same trophic level of the two bivalves within the food webs. At some stations, irrespective of geographic location, both bivalves showed delta N-15 values up to 18-20 aEuro degrees. These were two trophic levels higher than those found at the other stations, indicating local and/or episodic eutrophic conditions, probably due to waste water discharge, and the effectiveness of both Mytilus spp. and M. balthica as bio-indicators of anthropogenic eutrophication. Overall, our results suggest that pathways of energy flow from OM pools to dominant bivalves is more related to local environmental conditions than to geographic regions across the European coastline. This has implications for food web studies along the Atlantic coast because most of the values are consistent over a large area and show no significant differences. Therefore, the present study can be used twofold for the determination of trophic baselines and for the correction of the trophic position of consumers higher up in the food web in the case of differences in waste water discharge.

AB  - Multivariate dispersion has proven to be a broad beta-diversity measure that shows the heterogeneity of environmental conditions. The dispersion patterns of pelagic ciliate communities were investigated at eight water depths in the northern Bering Sea of the western Arctic Ocean and Chukchi Sea. Multivariate analysis indicated that (1) pelagic ciliates showed significant variability in multivariate dispersion on a vertical scale, (2) dispersion patterns were shaped by both the species composition and individual abundance, (3) vertical variation in species occurrence was significantly related to nutrients and chlorophylla, and (4) the dispersion measures at both species occurrence and species abundance resolutions were significantly negatively related to salinity and dissolved oxygen. This suggests that multivariate dispersion measures driven by both species composition and the individual abundance of pelagic ciliates may be a useful indicator of environmental heterogeneity in marine ecosystems.

AB  - The feasibility of biomarkers to accurately detect pollution in estuaries and coastal areas appears to be overestimated in the scientific literature, and is likely stemming from a bias towards publishing only positive results. Herein, we test the applicability of antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxidation to detect potential in situ sewage impacts on a subtropical estuary. We experimentally assessed variation in malondialdehyde (MDA, an indicator of lipid peroxidation) and total antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) through transplantations of the worm Laeonereis culveri from control to sewage-polluted areas. Variations in biomarkers were more related to natural environmental variability and small-scale heterogeneity among areas than to experimental exposure to sewage. Use of oxidative stress biomarkers is promising but further experimental work under real-life conditions is necessary to further validate and establish their accuracy and feasibility for practical purposes.

AB  - An environmental assessment of the estuarine waters of Guaratuba bay, Parana State, Brazil, is provided through the analysis of physical-chemical, biological and hydrographic dynamics. Twelve stations with a bi-monthly frequency (from October/2002 until August/2003) were sampled during spring and neap tides for the determination of pH, Secchi depth, CO2 saturation, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, suspended particulate matter and dissolved inorganic nutrients (nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, phosphate and silicate). Based on the evaluation of six parameters (chlorophyll, Secchi depth, CO2 saturation, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus and dissolved oxygen), Guaratuba Bay shows a low to medium trophic status, i.e. from meso- to oligotrophic, and a predominant heterotrophic metabolism, meaning that respiration overcomes primary production. Horizontal stratification was observed during the rainy season, while during the dry season the system showed more homogeneous conditions. Inorganic and/or organic matter in Guaratuba Bay seem to be controlled mainly by the seasonality of precipitation and/ also by ebb and flood tidal phase variations.

AB  - P>Robust critical systems are characterized by power laws which occur over a broad range of conditions. Their robust behaviour has been explained by local interactions. While such systems could be widespread in nature, their properties are not well understood. Here, we study three robust critical ecosystem models and a null model that lacks spatial interactions. In all these models, individuals aggregate in patches whose size distributions follow power laws which melt down under increasing external stress. We propose that this power-law decay associated with the connectivity of the system can be used to evaluate the level of stress exerted on the ecosystem. We identify several indicators along the transition to extinction. These indicators give us a relative measure of the distance to extinction, and have therefore potential application to conservation biology, especially for ecosystems with self-organization and critical transitions.

AB  - In recent years, significant efforts have been made to accelerate the economic development of the Arctic zone, leading to intense environmental pollution of this region, accompanied by the significant impact of accumulated environmental damage in the region. The solution to these problems is difficult due to the remoteness of these areas and severe climatic conditions. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the potential for restoration of arctic soils. For this purpose, various indicators are used, including biological ones.
   In the analyzed arctic soil samples, high concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons (up to 47,000 mg/kg) and chloride-ions (0.10-0.14 wt %) were established. Microbioassay demonstrated a presence of hydrocarbon-oxidizing microorganisms: Penicillium, Azotobacter chroococcum, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas oleovorans.
   A low enzymatic activity and specific Arctic climate point out a low self-restoration ability of the soil, demonstrated the need for its remediation.
   The microbioassay with microbial strains identification and soil remediation methods suitable for the Arctic zone were recommended.

AB  - A comparative analysis of five environmental flow assessment methods was performed on the example of the Yaselda River in its Selets section. The significant difference in their results was revealed. The threshold methods provide a uniform environmental flow values along the year. The values vary among the methods. It is explained that the methods were developed in different economic and social conditions. Practically identical results were obtained with the methods used in Belarus and Ukraine. However, the other method would assume the environmental flow value above the natural flow in some periods of the year. The method of exceedance probability transfer appears to be the most promising one. Partial zoning of probability transfer parameters would make the method more efficient. For management purposes it is proposed to introduce yearly adjustments of environmental flow rates taking into account the discharges of previous years. This would allow to re-water floodplains overdried in dry years and recover habitats for biota. (C) 2018 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The importance of gulls as bioindicators, reservoirs and vectors of Escherichia coli strains resistant to the older generation of antibiotics, broad spectrum cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones is reviewed in the following paper. The aim is to highlight the fact that they could be a hot spot for the development of new resistance types. Even though gulls do not naturally come into contact with antibiotics, they are omnivorous and they often eat food in agricultural, rural and urban areas so they can be infected with resistant strains from livestock or human sources which they can spread again into the environment. They may then come into contact with poultry kept under free range conditions. More intensive investigations of this subject are required, as well as the need to find accurate and reliable preventive measures, are demonstrated in the present paper.

AB  - Nothing is known about how plant populations chronically exposed to radiation adapt to a new anthropogenic stressor as engineered nanoparticles (ENP). A set of ecotoxicity tests was conducted with five types of ENP to investigate seed response of Leonurus quinquelobatus populations growing naturally under low-dose irradiation and background conditions. Five day toxicity tests detect the combined stimulation positive effects of irradiation stress with two types of ENP on seed germination. All of these effects are smoothed in 21 day old seedlings or reveal the significant adverse effects in three of the ENP. The commonly increased mutation load at the radiation pollution area synergistically increases fourfold to eightfold after TiO2 nanoparticle suspension exposure at 0.5-10 mM. These findings highlight the response on the combined nanoparticle and ionizing radiation influence on plant systems in the wild indicating that the environmental risk assessment of 4 of 5 ENP needs to be carried out.

AB  - The quality of the reported accounting data and the way these data are used are becoming more and more risky aspects of business management. Many instruments are already used to identify the creative accounting and the frauds and new ones are still being searched for. One of the suitable approaches is the use of the database Farm Accountancy Data Network (FAND) and environmental indicators. Monitoring of material balances and wastes in the form of environmental costs and also parts of the material balances can be a basis for the creation of the model for the detection of the material flow cost accounting. The model uses other balance areas as well: financial, energy-related and legislative. The paper presents a proposal of the model and its possible use for the discussion. The proposed model was applied to the real conditions of two real production companies with trading activities. Its strengths and weaknesses are evaluated.

AB  - In this article we evaluate a US Forest Service plan to mitigate damages from an invasive insect on public, forested land. We develop a dynamic model of infestation and control to explicitly account for biological interactions, baseline conditions, and uncertainty, thus creating a more complete picture of policy impacts than a static cost benefit analysis could provide. We combine the results of the dynamic model with an empirical study of nonmarket forest benefits to create a bioeconomic model of ecosystem management. Estimating the empirical model in a Bayesian framework allows us to treat the economic coefficients of the dynamic model as random variables. We specify distributions for the biological parameters and examine the effects of both biological and economic uncertainty on the predictive distribution of net benefits. We find that the net benefits of the program are positive, and that uncertainty in the biological model contributes substantially more to the variance of our estimate than does uncertainty over the valuation of the resource.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the abundance and the spatial distribution of fecal pollution indicators and pathogenic microorganisms in the lagoon. The relationships between microbial groups and abiotic measurements were also determined to evaluate the influence of environmental conditions on bacterial distribution and to identify the capability of coliforms and Enterococcus to predict the occurrence of Vibrio, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella. Surface water samples were collected monthly, from December 1999 to October 2000. Analyses were performed by traditional culture techniques. A uniform spatial distribution was observed for all bacterial groups. The fecal pollution indicators occurred in low abundances while potentially pathogenic microorganisms were consistently found. Therefore, our study supported the use of counts of coliforms and Enterococcus to indicate only recent fecal contamination.

AB  - A process of urban regeneration of the former industrial dock area of east London by the tendon Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) recognised the importance of geotechnical and geoenvironmental information. A systematic programme of data collection was implemented and stored in a series of bespoke computer database systems and cartographic registers. These allowed retrieval and manipulation of the data to provide rapid site assessments. The understanding of the natural setting of the area was enhanced as a consequence of the collation exercise. The data stored included geotechnical and environmental information on soil and groundwater. The hydrogeological regime was modelled by computer to determine the consequences of development on groundwater movement, In addition, a cartographic register of historic land use was developed. This gave instant detail on the potential for contamination of a site and became a fundamental tool in the UK planning process of the area, The information from the separate systems was finally combined into a geographic information system.

AB  - To investigate potential causal relationships between contaminant exposure and biological responses in fish, a suite of bioindicators ranging from the biochemical to the community-level were measured in fish populations and communities downstream from a bleached kraft mill effluent discharge. Downstream gradients in responses were evident in elevated hepatic mixed-function oxygenase activity, several measures of condition and bioenergetic status, growth, the health assessment index, and several fish community-level parameters. A multivariate discriminant analysis procedure, which included many of the individual bioindicators, also demonstrated a gradient in integrated health status of a sentinel fish species in the contaminated river. These downstream response gradients were probably influenced to a greater degree by contaminant discharges than by natural or anthropogenic nutrient sources downstream. Establishing causal relationships between a specific contaminant source and responses in sentinel aquatic organisms becomes relatively more straightforward when downstream gradients in biological responses are observed at multiple levels of biological organization.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Horses' behavior is a good indicator of their welfare status. However, its complexity requires objective, quantifiable, and unambiguous evidence-based assessment criteria. As healthy, stress-free horses exhibit a highly repetitive daily routine, horses' time budget (amount of time in a 24 h period spent on specific activities) can assist in equine welfare assessment. A systematic review of the literature yielded 12 papers that assessed equine time budgets for eating, resting and movement for a minimum of 24 continuous hours. A total of 144 horses (1-27 years old), 59 semi-feral and 85 domesticated horses, are included in this review. The reported 24 h time budgets for eating ranged from 10% to 66.6%, for resting from 8.1% to 66%, for lying from 2.7% to 27.3%, and for movement from 0.015% to 19.1%. The large variance in time budgets between studies can largely be attributed to differences in age and environmental conditions. Management interventions (free access to food, increased space, decreased population density) in domesticated horses yielded time budgets similar to semi-feral horses. The data support the importance of environmental conditions for horses' well-being and the ability of time budgets to assist in monitoring horses' welfare.
   Horses' behavior can provide valuable insight into their subjective state and is thus a good indicator of welfare. However, its complexity requires objective, quantifiable, and unambiguous evidence-based assessment criteria. As healthy, stress-free horses exhibit a highly repetitive daily routine, temporal quantification of their behavioral activities (time budget analysis) can assist in equine welfare assessment. Therefore, the present systematic review aimed to provide an up-to-date analysis of equine time budget studies. A review of the literature yielded 12 papers that fulfilled the inclusion criteria: assessment of equine time budgets for eating, resting and movement for a minimum of 24 continuous hours. A total of 144 horses (1-27 years old), 59 semi-feral and 85 domesticated horses, are included in this review. The 24 h time budgets for foraging or eating (10-6.6%), resting (8.1-66%), lying (2.7-27.3%), and locomotion (0.015-19.1%) showed large variance between studies, which can largely be attributed to differences in age and environmental conditions. Management interventions in domesticated horses (ad libitum access to food, increased space, decreased population density) resulted in time budgets similar to their (semi-)feral conspecifics, emphasizing the importance of environmental conditions and the ability of time budgets to assist in monitoring horses' welfare.

AB  - Changes in agricultural practices have lead to pollination deficits in entomophilous crops, leading to a growing interest in supplementing farmlands with managed colonies of honey bee, Apis mellifera. However, the metrics of a colony as a pollination unit is controversial due to the wide range of adult population sizes encountered in a colony, especially in relation with the time of year and beekeeping management. Correctly measuring the number of adult honey bees per hive is critical for farmers to adjust the number of colonies they need to meet crop pollination demand. We tested a simple non-invasive method to estimate the adult worker population size of colonies based on common beekeeping handlings. This method consisted in counting the number of inter-frames covered with adult bees (called IFB thereafter) from above the hive body. Based on the monitoring of 181 colonies, we investigated the nature of the relation between IFB and the adult bee population size and its context dependence to the meterological conditions and hive type. We then evaluated the possible improvement of the method with additional IFB counted in the supers and from below the hive body. Finally, we analysed the robustness of the method by comparing estimates obtained from colonies observed by experimented and naive observers. We revealed a clear-cut logarithmic relation between the IFB and the adult population size, covering the effects of meteorological conditions and hive type. The counting of IFB from above the hive body were particularly sensitive to meteorological conditions, unlike those counted from below the hive body. Moreover, the counting of additional IFB from the supers slightly improved the estimates of adult population size. Interestingly, no difference of estimate was detected between experimented and naive observers, suggesting applied simplicity of the method. The IFB counting method thus provides a simple, non-invasive and robust indicator of the adult population size of a managed honey bee colony. The counting of IFB from below the hive body should be recommend due to the sensitivity to meteorological conditions of the counting of IFB from above the hive body. Beyond crop pollination, we also highlighted application perspectives of this method as an indicator of survival probability. This method can therefore be viewed as a standard for routine field monitoring (i) to help farmers to estimate rigorously the number of colonies they need to meet the crop pollination demand and (ii) to help beekeepers assessing the mortality risk of their colonies.

AB  - The sustainable management of weeds is one of the main challenges in agriculture. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of plant phytotoxins, such as ailanthone fromAilanthus altissima(Mill) Swingle, as bioherbicides. Since a complex extract may be more active than a single compound, we explored the phytotoxicity ofA. altissimaextracts obtained from the leaves, samaras, rachises, and secondary roots, and we evaluated their application potential for weed control in horticulture. The pre-emergence activity of all plant extracts was evaluated over varying concentrations on two indicator species (i.e.,Lepidium sativumL. andRaphanus sativusL.) under controlled conditions. As the leaf extract was able to be generated in sufficient quantities, it was therefore further evaluated in glasshouse experiments with seven common weed species as indicators, as well as in a nursery production system for the cultivation of three horticultural crops (i.e.,Salvia officinalisL.,S. rosmarinusSchleid., andDianthus caryophyllusL.). Following the application of the extract, the index of germination (IGe%), the index of biomass, and the density of weeds per pot were evaluated, along with the impact on crop growth and quality (i.e., plant growth index and leaf damage). Under controlled conditions, the extract from the secondary root was the most active in reducing the IGe%, with greater persistence across time in both indicator species. At 18 days following application, the lowest concentration of the leaf extract at 1.8 mg L(-1)ailanthone reduced the IGe%by up to 15% and 45% inR. sativusandL. sativum, respectively. InR. sativus, all of the extract types affected the IGe%, but extract activity was greater inL. sativum. Under glasshouse conditions, leaf extracts containing 50 and 200 mg L(-1)ailanthone showed strong inhibition (98%-99%) in the biomass of all treated indicator and weed species. Under nursery conditions, leaf extracts formulated at 100 and 200 mg L(-1)ailanthone performed similarly, and no weeds were observed in any of the treated pots ofS. officinalisandS. rosmarinusin the 60-day study period. Conversely, in theD. caryophylluspots, an increase in the percentage of weed presence per pot was observed after 40 days. A reduction in the growth index and an increase in leaf phytotoxicity were observed during the cultivation experimentation, especially inS. officinaliswhen the extract was applied post-emergence to the crop canopy. Phytotoxicity was alleviated by the application of the extract directly to the soil or growth media. These results provide new insights intoA. altissimaextracts and their phytotoxicity to support their additional use as a sustainable solution for weed management in horticultural crops.

AB  - Vertical distributions of fractional cloud coverage derived from the U.S. Air Force 3DNEPH satellite, aircraft, and surface-based analysis are compared with related standard meteorological observations over the eastern United States. Cloud cover and related observations are interpolated onto the identical three-dimensional grid consisting of 15 tropospheric levels at various horizontal resolutions ranging from (80 km)2 to (800 km)2 for five local noon periods during a springtime midlatitude cyclone. During the period analyzed, cloud cover maximizes new 900 mb at 35% cloud cover and decreases to near-zero cover at the surface. Above 900 mb, fractional cloudiness gradually decreases to 10% - 20% cover at 200 mb. Cloud cover is positively correlated with relative humidity and large-scale vertical velocity, and negatively correlated with wind shear and temperature lapse rate, except in the lowest 100 mb, where cloud cover is weakly correlated with relative humidity, vertical velocity, wind shear, and temperature lapse rate. Mean fractional cloud coverage observed at various relative humidities and pressures is derived from these observations, and resolution-dependent algorithms for estimating cloud coverage from relative humidity are suggested. This analysis suggests that there is considerable uncertainty in measuring or calculating cloud cover and other meteorological factors averaged over large areas, especially in the upper troposphere. However, cloud cover appears to decrease exponentially as humidity falls below 100%, and relative to other layers in the troposphere, the layers 2.5-5 km above the surface contain the highest cloud amounts at the lowest relative humidities, with mean cloud amounts of 30% near 50% humidity at 650 mb. In the upper troposphere, cloud amounts are greater under convectively unstable conditions relative to stable conditions at high relative humidities. In the lower troposphere, high humidity environments where convection is possible contain lower cloud amounts relative to stable conditions at the same relative humidity, which may result from cumulus-induced subsidence of dry air into the lower troposphere under convectively unstable conditions. Using relative humidity alone as an indicator of cloud coverage, cloud amount can be assessed only to within a root-mean-square difference of 15%-30% from the 3DNEPH cloud cover, depending on the resolution at which calculations are performed. Many meteorological, climate, and chemical models of the atmosphere specify cloud amounts less than reported by these observations when relative humidities are less than 90%-95% during this analysis period. This is especially true in the midtroposphere (850-600 mb), where most algorithms specify zero cloud amounts at relative humidities below 60%-80%, while observed cloud amounts range from 20% to 60% at these height and humidity ranges. At humidities close to saturation, current algorithms probably overestimate cloud coverage.

AB  - We examined food chain length and food web complexity as indicators for assessing shallow lake resilience from 18 lowland lakes, which included lakes in near-reference condition through to lakes that had undergone catastrophic regime shifts. We observed a trend of decreasing food chain length and food web complexity in lakes that had undergone regime shifts. Across the full trophic gradient, food web metrics were correlated with factors related to trophic status (e.g. chlorophyll-a) and macrophyte loss (e.g. exotic herbivorous fish), which have been previously associated with regime shifts in lakes. With increasing eutrophication, we identified a shift away from omnivory mostly in the lower trophic levels. Factors that impinge on macrophyte communities, such as nutrient loading and herbivory, reduce the resilience of shallow lake ecosystems, which is reflected in changes to lake food web structure. Thus, food web indicators can inform about the sensitivity of shallow lakes to eutrophication.

AB  - Protecting valued attributes of a river's socio-ecological system demands a more holistic approach to freshwater management. Effective communication is critical to convey the breadth of values and the state of water systems to decision-makers if they are to make meaningful decisions. Worldwide, environmental report cards are being used to define and measure progress towards environmental sustainability and promoted as an effective communication and engagement tool to galvanise commitment and action. This paper discusses the value of environmental report cards and contends that they can be a valuable integrative tool to support restoration strategies, as well as a way of conveying monitoring results to increase understanding about the health and well-being of catchments. We present two case studies from the Waikato and Waitaki River in New Zealand where report cards based on eco-cultural frameworks have been developed that explicitly link indicators that assess the state or condition of the catchment with the vision and goals articulated by iwi/hapu.

AB  - The ocean environment is filled with natural sound, but the last century has introduced many anthropogenic activities that have increased the levels of noise. Research on the impact of anthropogenic noise on marine fauna is now extensive. Levels of threat are well defined. Mitigation and monitoring guidelines exist in many parts of the world; especially for offshore petroleum exploration. In many jurisdictions, these guidelines rely on environmental impact assessments (EIAs) consideration by decision-makers, yet few jurisdictions stipulate what such assessments should contain. Sound propagation in the marine environment is complex, yet robust and defensible modelling is rarely conducted. Many impact assessments are inadequately checked. This stands in contrast to the equivalent process for land-based assessments. We argue that defensible EIAs should include modelling of the proposed noise impact in the region and under the conditions of planned activity. We articulate why clear guidelines about the content of EIAs are needed and propose a template for offshore petroleum exploration assessment.

AB  - Plants are considered as good bioindicators because of their significant role in food chain transfer. They are also easy to grow, adaptable to environmental stresses and can be used for assaying a range of environmental conditions in different habitats. Thus, many plant species have been used as bioindicators. In order to evaluate the genotoxic effect of cadmium, okra (Abelmoschus esculantus L.) seedlings were treated with different concentrations (30, 60, 120 mg l(-1)) of cadmium and investigated for their population parameters such as inhibition of root growth; total soluble protein content, dry weight and also the impact of metal on the genetic material by RAPD analysis. Root growth and total soluble protein content in okra seedlings were reduced with increased Cd concentrations. RAPD analysis indicated formation of new bands mostly at 60 and 120 mg l(-1) Cd treatments. Altered DNA band patterns and population parameters after Cd treatments suggest that okra could be used as an indicator to reveal the effects of genotoxic agents.

AB  - A challenging activity in the promotion of sustainable development is to synthesise indicators that can support decision-making. In developing countries such as Brazil, the use of information in support of the health and health-related environment of humans needs improvement. This paper presents a proposal for a system that can evaluate human health and urban environment sanitation in an integrated manner. The indicators selected for human health were child mortality rate, mortality rate due to acute diarrhoea for all ages and 1-4-year-old mortality rate due to acute respiratory tract infections. Environmental sanitation has been represented by indicators of sanitation coverage, such as sewerage. The paper describes the design of a fuzzy linguistic model that synthesises these indicators. The designed fuzzy rule-based system has proved to be a useful tool to integrate information and assist in the public planning of interrelated areas. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Local-scale surveys of ant communities have shown to be valuable tools for assessing environmental conditions in follow-up studies of forest areas. We have used ant species richness as a bioindicator to evaluate a rehabilitation project in an Atlantic Forest fragment of southeast Brazil. Eighteen sites were selected, including three different successional stages: early stage (3-5 years), intermediate stage (10-15 years), and intermediate stage under Myracrodruon urundeuva dominance (10-15 years). In total, 33 ant species were recorded in the whole studied area of Bulcao Farm. No significant differences in species richness were found between the successional stages; with 21, 30 and 23 species found, respectively, in the early, intermediate and intermediate under M. urundeuva dominance areas. Species richness in the ground was significantly higher than on vegetation. We believe that the greater environmental heterogeneity presented by the intermediate successional stages was not sufficient to generate differences in ant species richness.

AB  - Various methods have been proposed to calculate maximum sustainable yield, MSY, from biomass estimates, but the classical approach of Gulland, MSY = 0.5 M B-0 is still widely used, despite overwhelming theoretical and practical evidence pointing to its limited value, probably due to confusion as to the alternative methods available. A review of alternative methods is presented and their applicability to species with high values of M discussed. An extreme-value strategy is proposed for introducing considerations of risk and precaution into a management system based on precautionary reference points. We also focus on problems of estimating MSY and other reference points, review alternative estimators and discuss some of the ecological and life history criteria that affect how these estimators should be used: as targets or limits for exploitation, as indicators of conformity under sustainable harvesting conditions, or even for ecocertification of responsible or sustainable fisheries.

AB  - The composition of microbial communities varies considerably across ecological environments, particularly in extreme environments, where unique microorganisms are typically used as the indicators of environmental conditions. However, the ecological reasons for the differences in microbial communities remain largely unknown. Herein, we analyzed taxonomic and functional community profiles via high-throughput sequencing to determine the alkaline saline soil bacterial and archaeal communities in the Qarhan Salt Lake area in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The results showed that Betaproteobacteria (Proteobacteria) and Halobacteria (Euryarchaeota) were the most abundant in the soils of this area, which are common in high salinity environments. Accordingly, microbes that can adapt to local extremes typically have unique metabolic pathways and functions, such as chemoheterotrophy, aerobic chemoheterotrophy, nitrogen fixation, ureolysis, nitrate reduction, fermentation, dark hydrogen oxidation, and methanogenesis. Methanogenesis pathways include hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, CO2 reduction with H-2, and formate methanogenesis. Thus, prokaryotic microorganisms in high salinity environments are indispensable in nitrogen and carbon cycling via particular metabolic pathways.

AB  - Home to about 45% of the global population, rich in natural resources and ecosystems with a high value, rural areas play a key role in implementing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, some rural areas continue to face structural challenges, notably due to a combination of population loss and population ageing, making it more difficult to maintain their own living conditions. Enhancing the quality of life in rural areas is fundamental to reducing youth out-migration and ensuring that rural areas and communities remain attractive places to live and work. Based on Sen's capability approach, we propose an integrated and dynamic model able to perform a spatial-temporal analysis of the quality of life in rural areas. The model was implemented in order to perform evaluations at a municipality level, considered the most appropriate spatial scale to analyse sub-regional disparities and increase the efficiency of rural development expenditures.

AB  - The environmental history of the central Pantanal wetlands of western Brazil is inferred for the last 19 kyrs based on a multi-indicator paleolimnological analysis of a sediment core from Lake Negra. The core, dated by C-14 and OSL, shows variations in the abundance, diversity, and preservation of sponge spicules and phytoliths through time, consistent with changing aquatic environments. In the late Pleistocene, Lake Negra was influenced by a strong monsoon and fluvial depositional processes, whereas in the Holocene, there was a drier interval where the lake was more isolated on the floodplain. Hiatuses in the stratigraphy resulted from both wet and dry conditions, through fluvial channel scour or subaerial exposure of the lake floor, respectively. Data suggest that floodplain lakes in the Pantanal wetlands and similar riverine wetlands respond in a complex and, at times, indirect manner to climate change, and the dynamics of the adjacent fluvial system must be accounted for when interpreting paleohydrology and vegetation patterns.

AB  - We evaluated whether species with aquatic reproduction would be more dependent on environmental conditions than species with terrestrial reproduction, which we predicted to be more affected by factors that induce spatial patterns unrelated to known environmental predictors. An analysis of all the species combined indicated a stronger spatial pattern than that induced by the environmental factors. However, the observed pattern was highly dependent on the reproductive mode. The distributions of species with aquatic reproduction were more related to the environmental variables, while species with terrestrial reproduction showed strong spatial patterns. Species that are strongly influenced by environmental controls may be more sensitive to specific threats (such as conversion of riparian areas), whereas species that do not have restrictive reproductive requirements, but present strong associations with forests, could be better indicators of the general environmental degradation associated with climate change or selective timber harvesting.

AB  - In this paper we review research on eutrophication, acidification and climate change based on studies of lake sediments in the Alps. Studies on fossil diatoms, chrysophytes, plant pigments, Cladocera and carbonaceous particles in a number of high altitude lakes in Italy and Switzerland have been used to track environmental changes. We present an original study on fossil Cladocera in sediment cores from 29 lakes that have shown changes in biodiversity from the pre-industrial period (ca. pre AD 1850) to the present. These data show that altitude, ca. 60 years of acidification impacts and fish stocking are the most important factors that affect their distribution and abundance. We review further case studies from two morphometrically and chemically different lakes (Tovel and Paione Superiore). Their lake sediment records span 400 and 150 years, respectively; multi-core, multi-proxy analyses show their pH, trophic and climatic evolution over time.

AB  - Ghylls are linear valley features cut into the sandy beds of the Weald of south-eastern England. The ghyll's indigenous woodlands are highly species rich at the small scale, support distinctive assemblages of cryptogamic plants, and are unique to south-east England. Field surveys were carried out for 48 ghyll woodlands in the Weald with a GIS used to examine the ecology, landform and conservation status of the ghyll woodlands. The data were analysed using spatial and multi-variate techniques in order to identify sub-groups or ghyll woodland communities based upon species composition, topography and geology. The ghylls are shown to be reasonably uniform for canopy vegetation type and structure and for their geological and soil characteristics. However, analysis shows that geomorphology, understorey and field layer variability may act as stronger indicators of site conditions and character. Further analysis focused on the level and extent of nature conservation protection that these unique and ancient systems receive. The study concludes that despite their ecological importance and potentially international significance, ghyll woodlands are poorly understood and protected.

TI  - Towards the age of corporate responsibility? Emerging challenges for the business world
T2  - FUTURES
LA  - English
AB  - The article seeks to show how the issue of ethical corporations can be examined and challenged through the concept of corporate responsibility. Corporate responsibility first emerged as a term around 10 years ago with the rise of environmental reporting systems. At that time, the UNCED summit in Rio boosted the general level of consciousness concerning these issues and the first business-driven international organisation to tackle the field, Business Council for Sustainable Development, emerged. Globalisation, which by any indicators accelerated enormously during the 1990s, has challenged corporations to consider responsibility in a new light. The evolution and spread of a global network of finance have increased the need for transparency and responsibility, at the same time as the shift from 'international' to 'global' signified the gradual breakdown of old institutions and the emergence of new ones. This article evaluates how corporations have responded to this challenge and postulates, in the light of increasing pressures on human and natural conditions, a coming 'Age of Responsibility' that will set corporate responsibility a basis for any action in business world.

AB  - Benthic marine food webs, which recycle organic matter and sustain unique biodiversity, are an important component of estuarine Patagonian fjords; however, these may be heavily influenced by salmon farming activities. Under the above conditions, this study collected several food sources (sediment organic matter, suspended particulate organic matter, macroalgae) and 26 benthic invertebrate species, and analyzed them using a Bayesian mixing model. Briefly, carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes analyses revealed that the highly variable isotopic niche widths respond to food supplies from marine and terrestrial organic matter. In addition, particulate and dissolved waste from salmon farming activities were found to modify isotopic composition ratios in many suspension feeders. Particularly, our results indicate high delta N-15 values in the sponge Cliona chilensis and the encrusting coral Incrustatus comauensis, which appear to be potential ecological indicators for evaluating stoichiometry imbalances and trace organic pollution sources in fjord environments.

AB  - Wondrously elaborate weapons and displays that appear to be counter to ecological optima are widespread features of male contests for mates across the animal kingdom. To understand how such diverse traits evolve, here we develop a quantitative genetic model of sexual selection for a male signaling trait that mediates aggression in male-male contests and show that an honest indicator of aggression can generate selection on itself by altering the social environment. This can cause selection to accelerate as the trait is elaborated, leading to runaway evolution. Thus, an evolving source of selection provided by the social environment is the fundamental unifying feature of runaway sexual selection driven by either male-male competition or female mate choice. However, a key difference is that runaway driven by male-male competition requires signal honesty. Our model identifies simple conditions that provide clear, testable predictions for empirical studies using standard quantitative genetic methods.

AB  - Achieving multi-million-hectare commitments from countries around the world to restore degraded lands in resilient and sustainable ways requires, among other things, huge volumes of tree planting material. Seed systems encompassing all forest reproductive material (e.g., seeds, cuttings, stakes, and wildings), are key to ensuring that sufficient planting material with a diverse range of suitable species, adapted to local conditions and capable of persisting under a changing climate, is available for restoration projects. The ideal structure of a seed system integrates five components: seed selection and innovation, seed harvesting and production, market access, supply and demand, quality control, and an enabling environment. We propose 15 indicators to evaluate these key components and trial them by assessing national seed systems in 7 Latin American countries. We conclude that the indicators enable a straightforward assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of national seed systems, thus assisting governments to identify key areas for improvement and opportunities for horizontal learning.

AB  - Chironomid (Diptera: Chironomidae) larvae play an important role in a wide range of aquatic ecosystems. The study focuses on Chironomidae trophic guilds and morphological types as indicator traits in reconstructions of habitat changes in shallow water bodies. Mentum and ventromental plates are important mouthparts whose shape depends on food type and feeding behavior. Chironomidae larvae strongly vary in the mode of life and feeding habits, representing almost every feeding group. Here we classified the mentum types into 16 groups and tested if they indicated similar past habitat changes as the Chironomidae functional feeding groups (FFGs), and tribes/subfamilies. Paleoecological data of biotic and abiotic proxies were derived from short sequences from a Late Glacial oxbow and a nearby medieval moat located in Central Poland. The study revealed that the habitat substratum structure, vegetation and physicochemical conditions are associated both with the feeding types and morphological traits. This provides a valuable tool for future reconstructions of habitat changes.

AB  - This article examines representation of ecological crises in children's media. Children's media constitutes an important area of ecocinema critique due to the particular vulnerability of children to persuasive messaging. Using themes from ecocinema studies, we conduct a textual analysis of two animated motion pictures: Universal Pictures' The Lorax [(2012). The Lorax. Directed by Chris Renaud. Universal City, CA: Author)] and Pixar's Wall-E [(2008). Wall-E. Directed by Andrew Stanton. 2008. Emeryville, CA: Author]. We analyze these films in terms of: (1) anthropomorphic representations; (2) displacement of collective aspects of ecological crisis to the level of interpersonal conflict; (3) greenwashing; and (4) narratives of pastoralism and replenishment. We consider how these films discursively constitute ecological conditions, processes, and crises. We examine these representations as indicators of an underlying crisis in capitalism, of a struggle to come to terms with ecological destabilization. Ultimately, we conclude that a more speculative reimagining of the relationship between humans and the natural world is required to stave off the worst effects of global ecological destabilization.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the influence of spacing, species richness, and sampling time on accumulated litter in forest restoration areas in the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil. The experiment was conducted under a randomized complete block design, in a subdivided plot scheme. Six treatments were evaluated, consisting of a combination of spacing levels and species richness. Accumulated litter samples were weighed and chemically analyzed to obtain nutrient concentrations. The variables analyzed in the restoration process, in general, did not influence litter biomass and nutrient concentrations. The time elapsed between restoration implantation and data sampling for the present study may have been insufficient for the occurrence of differences in variables evaluated. Despite the small amount of accumulated litter, it is of great importance for soil physical protection and fertility improvement, generating conditions for the stabilization of new forest species in the restoration area.

AB  - Interest has increased over the last several years in using different methods for treating sewage. The rapid population growth in developing countries (Egypt, for example, with a population of more than 87 millions) has created significant sewage disposal problems. There is therefore a growing need for sewage treatment solutions with low energy requirements and using indigenous materials and skills. Gravel Bed Hydroponics (GBH) as a constructed wetland system for sewage treatment has been proved effective for sewage treatment in several Egyptian villages. The system provided an excellent environment for a wide range of species of ciliates (23 species) and these organisms were potentially very useful as biological indicators for various saprobic conditions. Moreover, the ciliates provided excellent means for estimating the efficiency of the system for sewage purification. Results affirmed the ability of this system to produce high quality effluent with sufficient microbial reduction to enable the production of irrigation quality water.

AB  - Public land management agencies have incorporated the concept of vulnerability into protocols for assessing and planning for climate change impacts on public forests and grasslands. However, resource managers and planners have little guidance for how to address the social aspects of vulnerability in these assessments and plans. Failure to assess social vulnerability to climate change during management planning could compromise land management agencies' adaptation strategies as well as public support for these strategies. We provide a framework for understanding and assessing social vulnerability to climate change in US public lands contexts. We describe types of information that can be used in social vulnerability assessments and ways this information can be gathered. The practical information that we provide is intended to help resource managers and planners meet current policy requirements for assessing potential impacts of climate change across diverse local social and ecological conditions for which one-size-fits-all approaches are not likely to be useful.

AB  - Plant-related inputs provide the resources for nematode communities. Sampling of nematode communities must be on appropriate temporal and spatial scales. Size, feeding types, food or host specificity, and chronology allow over 200 nematode species to coexist in a district. Relationships between nematode functional groups and ecological processes regulating decomposition processes have been found in field experiments. Pulse-labeling experiments have shown root-feeding nematodes to increase the flow of carbon from roots to soil microbial biomass. Soil texture is related to suitability for cropping and affects nematode communities through crop-specific infestations. Nematode diversity tends to be greatest in ecosystems with least disturbance, and bacterial-feeding nematodes make the greatest contribution to the decomposer food web in more intensively managed ecosystems. Indices of the nematode fauna reflect changes in the nematode community; these changes reflect soil and ecological processes. Understanding the role of nematodes in these processes is the key to understanding of the relationship between plants and soil nematode communities.

AB  - The limited knowledge on oil-ice interactions and on the ecological outcomes of oil spills in the Arctic represent sources of uncertainties for shipping and oil and gas activities in polar regions. The present work aims at the definition of the ecological risk posed by oil spills in the Arctic by the integration of an improved surface slick model to a fugacity-based food-web bioaccumulation model for icy waters. The model's outcomes are the representation of transport and weathering processes and the concentrations of a toxic component of oil, namely naphthalene, in the environmental media as a function of ice conditions. Given those concentrations, the associated ecological risk is defined in terms of the bioconcentration factor (BCF). Overall, the model predicted low bioaccumulation and biomagnification potential for naphthalene to a hypothetical Arctic food web, regardless of the ice concentration.

AB  - The present research aims to discuss with important governmental, scientific and technological authors the ways to revitalize an industrial pole related to a sector considered a priority. The methodology was of an empirical nature, of an exploratory nature, with bibliographical data collection. The discussion about the formation of the Local Productive Arrangement of Ilheus, BA, as well as analyzing the main authors of the innovation ecosystem of Ilheus and region, and finally proposes measures adjusted to the expectations of results of the new profile and characteristic of the region and of the parents. We researched the initiatives already carried out aiming at the recovery of the Pole between the years 2017 and 2018. The results of the research show two linear slopes, the first represented in a similar way to "punch in knife point" that levels down fundamental indicators of performance organizational structure. The second strand suggests actions of quantitative advances, figuratively represented by the "Phoenix", which can create conditions to guarantee the competitiveness and sustainability of the Ilheus Information Center and consequently the development of the region.

AB  - Soil contamination with total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) is widespread throughout the globe due to the massive production of TPH anthropogenically and its occurrence in the soil. TPH is toxic to beneficial soil organisms and humans and thus has become a serious concern among the public. Traditionally TPH toxicity in the soil is estimated based on chemical fractions and a range of bioassays including plants, invertebrates and microorganisms. There is a large inconsistency among ecotoxicology data using these assays due to the nature of TPH and their weathering. Therefore, in this article, we critically reviewed the weathered conditions of TPH, the potential fate in soil and the bioindicators for the assessment of the ecotoxicity. Based on the current research and the state-of-the-art problem, we also highlighted key recommendations for future research scope for the real-world solution of the ecotoxicological studies of hydrocarbons.

AB  - The paper examines the applicability of several desktop hydrology-based environmental flow assessment methods-Tennant, range of variability approach (RVA) and South African desktop reserve model (DRM)-in the specific context of Nepal. Some of these techniques are modified, following the discussion of their limitations. It is indicated that hydrology-based methods of environmental flow assessment represent a necessary first step in planning for environmental allocations in developing countries. It is shown that use can be made of complementary features of existing environmental flow assessment techniques to arrive at justified estimates of environmental flows, even in the conditions of limited basin-specific eco-hydrological knowledge. The methods described in the paper could also be used in other countries-by relevant departments, agencies and organizations, which are engaged in ecosystem management and preservation of aquatic environment. This research intends to promote the need for environmental water allocation planning in river basin development and to streamline the inclusion of environmental water demand assessments into relevant national policies.

AB  - We developed a simple method to measure feeding activity of Mytilus edulis using a camcorder placed inside an underwater housing, a plastic frame for holding mussels and time lapse videography. Exhalant siphon area. indicative of feeding activity, was monitored in laboratory mussels exposed to filtered seawater and various concentrations of microalgae, including Pavlova lutheri or Tetraselmis suecica. Exhalant siphon area increased as algal concentration increased from zero to similar to25-30 x 10(3) cells ml(-1), but declined again at higher concentrations. Advantages of this method include portability and relatively low cost, high resolution of data over short and long temporal scales, potentially large sample sizes, and minimum logistics required for deployment in a variety of different environments. Once relationships between exhalant siphon area and other indicators of feeding such as filtration rate have been established, this method could greatly improve our understanding of bivalve feeding in situ and how they respond in dynamic natural conditions.

AB  - The health and environmental effects of chemical processes can be assessed during the initial stage of their production. In this paper, the Chemical Screening Tool for Exposure and Environmental Release (ChemSTEER) software was used to compare the health and environmental risks of spray pyrolysis and wet chemical techniques for the fabrication of nano-structured metal oxide on a semi-industrial scale with a capacity of 300 kg/day in Iran. The pollution sources identified in each production process were pairwise compared in Expert Choice software using indicators including respiratory damage, skin damage, and environmental damages including air, water, and soil pollution. The synthesis of nanostructured zinc oxide using the wet chemical technique (with 0.523 wt%) leads to lower health and environmental risks compared to when spray pyrolysis is used (with 0.477 wt%). The health and environmental risk assessment of nanomaterial production processes can help select safer processes, modify the operation conditions, and select or modify raw materials that can help eliminate the risks.

AB  - It is the function of concrete to protect reinforcement against corrosion from environmental attack. However, reinforced concrete structures in most cases suffer from corrosion of steel reinforcement and their service lives get reduced. The steel in concrete is always prone to corrosion attack, and the reason being that concrete is porous in nature. Fluids and dissolved ions can impregnate through pore space or through cracks and come in contact with reinforcement. Preventive maintenance is the best corrosion control mitigation measure for reinforced concrete structures. This paper highlights the causes of corrosion in non-coastal areas case study is Kigali in Rwanda. Condition assessment of two reinforced concrete buildings in Kigali has been made based on structural survey. It was found that Crack width varies up to 2mm in column and beams. It is also suggested that to improve the life span of the columns and beams by retrofitting with advanced materials and the new structures are to be constructed with corrosion monitoring systems.

AB  - Rivers are typified by considerable seasonal flow variability. In rivers that flow through alluvial deposits, fine sediment (<63 m) is readily suspended, especially during periods of high discharge. Therefore, assessment of the effects on biota of anthropogenic stressors must occur within the context of dynamic turbidity and background flow conditions. We used the Qu'Appelle River in southern Saskatchewan as a study system for which we developed a model in which discharge is a principal determinant of in-stream suspended sediment. We explored this relationship with a case study showing that macroinvertebrate community structure was strongly correlated with suspended sediment gradients and, ultimately, predicted by discharge. Factors affecting sediment loads and ecosystem responses in managed systems should be considered so that in-stream water quantity and quality needs are met. This new understanding should enable development of improved ecosystem-based flow-management objectives.

AB  - We present a novel framework for estimating site-specific effects of pollutants on natural populations. Our method is based on fitness optimization and uses observed differences in tolerance (sensitivity) to a particular pollutant between populations at contaminated and uncontaminated sites (i.e., target and reference populations). In addition, the method uses laboratory estimates of the fitness cost of tolerance, that is, the reduction of population growth rate (fitness) of a target population compared to that of a reference population when both are maintained in uncontaminated conditions. As a case study, we applied this framework to analyze observed genetic differentiation in tolerance to the pyrethroid insecticide fenvalerate between Daphnia galeata populations in Lake Kasumigaura and an adjacent agricultural pond. The estimated exposure level at the contaminated site was about 0.015 mu g/L, and the population-level risk corresponded to about a 24 % reduction of the intrinsic rate of natural increase.

Enormous progress in audio signal processing and pattern recognition in recent years makes it possible to incorporate automated methods into the detection of bird vocalisations. These methods can be employed to support the census of population sizes. We report about a study testing the feasibility of bird monitoring supported by automatic bird song detection. In particular, we describe novel algorithms for the detection of the vocalisations of two endangered bird species and show how these can be used in automatic habitat mapping. These methods are based on detecting temporal patterns in a given frequency band typical for the species. Special effort is put into the suppression of the noise present in real-world audio scenes. Our results show that even in real-world recording conditions high recognition rates with a tolerable rate of false positive detections are possible. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The public, increasingly well-informed about the problem of excessive noise, is taking actions for the development of new transport infrastructure projects and improvement of existing infrastructure. In addition, many countries have implemented mandatory Environmental Impact Assessment procedures. As a result, the construction of sound barriers has become a common measure, which can be used by an agency to mitigate potentially significant noise impacts. A sound barrier, eventually, will become part of the surrounding landscape and could be a cause of impact for ecosystems, the road users and those who live alongside the road. Basically, this article discusses these potential effects in the context of environmental assessment procedures. In addition, results of a pilot survey conducted at a residential area affected by the construction of a barrier are presented. Although most residents felt that sleeping conditions improved after the barrier was built, most important negative reactions are the loss of sunlight and visual impact. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, we examined the impacts of small weirs on the parasite community of gudgeon and toxostome in a medium-sized river. We tested changes on parasite species diversity using indices that capture both richness and abundance characteristics, and we examined parasite community structure with null models (co-occurrence index C score) and a multiple discriminant function analysis (MDFA). Our results showed that parasite community diversity of gudgeon is strongly influenced by weirs with a maximum diversity upstream of the weirs. Weirs also induce change in abundance of gudgeon parasite species particularly during summer. Nevertheless, we obtained that weirs had no effect on the parasite co-occurrence patterns. In addition, similarity indices indicate that the parasite faunas of newly established limnophilic species (roach and bleak) are host-specific and are rarely transmitted to other fish species. We conclude that fish parasite communities responded in different ways to the presence of impassable weirs, but, in a general tendency, changing environmental conditions induced by weirs may represent an ecological risk.

AB  - Ecological risk assessment for bioaccumulative chemicals at hazardous waste sites like Rocky Mountain Arsenal (RMA) is challenging, particularly when the site is large and is characterized by heterogeneous environments and patterns of contamination. Because RMA is an National Priorities List site and a future wildlife refuge, an effective and practical risk assessment approach was required. This approach includes methods to estimate contaminant concentrations below detection limits, spatial and temporal integration, bioaccumulation, and toxicity criteria. Validation of the quantitative risk assessment approach was achieved through comparisons of observed versus predicted tissue concentration values, as well as evaluation of ecological endpoints relative to wildlife health. The results of the assessment based on this approach provide a realistic representation of observed conditions at RMA, and provide quantitative conclusions that are consistent with qualitative observations of the health and diversity of biota at RMA. In addition to supporting baseline risk assessment, the approach provides a useful framework for evaluation of future risk management alternatives.

AB  - Extreme weather conditions have caused difficulties in the Hungarian drinking water management many times in the past. High demand for drinking water in dry summer periods and the accompanying reduction in water resources lead to insufficiency in the availability of a number of water supplies, therefore causing limitations in water access. In some other cases, as a result of excessive precipitation, floods and flash floods evolved over karstic areas, and several water supplies had to be excluded from operation in order to avoid the risk of infections.
   The expected increase in the number of extreme weather conditions and further possible changes in future climate necessitates the analysis of the vulnerability of drinking water resources to climate change. Since 95% of the total drinking water supply in Hungary originates from subsurface layers, significance of groundwater resources is outstanding.
   Our work was carried out in the frames of the NAGiS (National Adaptation Geo-information System) project with the aim to devise a methodology for the study and determination of the vulnerability of drinking water supplies to climate. Methods have been chosen according to the CIVAS (Climate Impact and Vulnerability Assessment Scheme) model that has been developed in the frame of the international climate research project CLAVIER (Climate Change and Variability: Impact on Central and Eastern Europe). The CIVAS model, being based on the combined evaluation of exposure, sensitivity, impact, adaptability, and vulnerability provides a unified methodical scheme to quantitative climatic impact assessment.
   The investigation involves the analyses of climatic parameters primarily influencing drinking water supplies and hydrogeological characteristics of the geological media that significantly determines vulnerability. Apart from the expected environmental changes,societal and economic processes have also been taken into account. Climate vulnerability has been determined on the basis of the distribution and categorization of the chosen indicators.
   Further effects, independent of climate change and caused by anthropogenic activity, result in similar phenomena. It is often difficult to differentiate between natural and anthropogenic effects that occur simultaneously; therefore, anthropogenic activity is necessary to be taken into account.
   In the analyses we used data of two different climate models covering two separate future time periods. Results on the basis of both climate model projections suggest that a considerable number of regions in the area under investigation appear to be vulnerable to climate change to a certain extent, and vulnerability intensifies to the end of the 21st century.

AB  - The superlative environmental conditions in Southern Amazonia, i.e. high temperatures and annual rainfall, create ideal conditions for high soil organic matter turnover rates and therewith the soil-atmosphere exchanges of greenhouse gases. In this study, we present daily observations of soil-related carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) emissions from the dominant land use types in Mato Grosso (cerrado, gallery forest, cattle pasture, and cropland under soybean) and Para (rainforest and cattle pastures) during the early rain season. We followed the hypothesis that precipitation events provoke hot moments for CO2 and N2O, and lead to alternating uptake and emission for CH4, respectively. Observed fluxes differed significantly between land use types and underlying soil type. CO2 fluxes from soils under natural vegetation ranged from 101 mg m(-2) h(-1) in the cerrado to 160 mg C m(-2) h(-1) in the rainforest. Fluxes from cattle pastures varied between locations and were 79 mg C m(-2) h(-1) from the pasture in Mato Grosso and between 120 and 180 mg C m(-2) h-(1) from pastures in Para. For N2O, fluxes were highest from rainforest (16 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)) and lowest from cerrado soil (-0.05 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)). Similar to CO2, the pastures in Para emitted higher fluxes of N2O (2-8 mu g N m(-2) h-(1)) compared to the pasture in Mato Grosso (0.09 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)). CH4 fluxes were negative on all sites, except for two pasture sites in Para, where recorded fluxes amounted to 10 and 53 mu g C m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The dynamic behavior during the measurement period, as determined by an indicator function, was moderate for N2O, low for CO2 and CH4, and depended on the site and measurement chamber, respectively. Nevertheless, N2O fluxes from the cropland increased during the end of the vegetation period of soybean, likely as a result of increased nitrogen availability due to ceasing plant roots. At the same time cattle pastures showed an age-related decrease of N2O emissions, whereas they turned out to being considerable sources for CH4. Generally, the low dynamics and missing reactions to precipitation events demonstrate poor process understanding and need to be further investigated.

AB  - The Oliva-Pego marsh is an important rice and citrus growing area in the Spanish Levant. The marsh is situated in the area of maximal rainfall of the Autonomous Community of Valencia and has high temperatures year-round. This marsh presents a conductivity gradient that goes from fresh water to brackish in its main inflowing streams, which gives way to a large variety of macro and microalgae, that form characteristic groups in the different conditions. Several of these species show tropical affinity.
   The results of two samplings in 1999 are presented, which were carried out in the most contrasting environmental zones-those of minimum and maximum rainfall. In each sampling site (four water bodies: Bullent River, Ullal River close to the Bullent, Bassa Sineu and the Font Sallat) pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, current velocity, depth, and cationic and anionic contents of the water were assessed.
   The communities studied were constituted by structural species of Cyanophyceae and Chlorophyceae. Diatoms were the most diverse group, while Cyanophyceae and Chlorophyceae formed the visible elements. As structural elements, the presence of Homoeothrix juliana (Meneghini) Kirchner and Schizothrix fasciculata (Nageli) Gomont was to be noteed in oligohaline waters and Chaetophorales, Phormidium tenue (Meneghini) Gomont, Calothrix pulvinata Kutzing and Pleurocapsales in slightly brackish waters.
   The diatoms Encyonopsis microcephala Grunow Krammer, Cymbella affinis Kutzing and Navicula cryptotenella Lange-Bertalot were responsible for their chlorophyll c contribution in two streams (Rio Bullent and Ullal), while Hyalodiscus whitneyi Ehrenberg. Nitzschia gracilis Hantzsch, Navicella pusilla (Grunow) Krammer and Cocconeis placentula var. euglypta (Ehrenberg) Grunow were responsible in Font Salat, and Rhoicosphenia abbreviata (C. Agardh) Lange-Bertalot was responsible in Bassa Sineu. Characteristic communities of the different degrees of water salinity were observed in the different water bodies, composed of species with affinity for those conditions.
   The sources in the marsh are fundamental as consistent providers of water, with a constancy in the species within the community. This is why they can be used as equilibrium indicators of the system, in order to understand the combined effects of salinity and water regime on marsh biodiversity. This information is important as an environmental referent for water policies and legislative measures with water quality indicators of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) of the European Community (EC), and offers a precedent for the improvement of ecological quality of both freshwater and marine systems.

AB  - With increased growth potential on the one hand, but on the other hand a high percentage of trees exhibiting visible damages and the apparent regional decline in Common beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) stands in Europe, new questions arise about the sensitivity and resistance of this tree species to current environmental changes. In order to obtain more relevant information about this, 36 beech stands under different climatic and environmental conditions throughout Europe were selected and investigated by dendroecological methods. The variation of tree ring widths of Common beech was found to be a very sensitive indicator, reflecting clearly the signals of environmental influences. A high statistical quality of tree ring chronologies demonstrates a high suitability for dendroecological analysis. The investigation of long-term growth variations results in site-dependent and especially elevation-dependent growth trends.
   Since 1950, at lower altitude sites in Central Europe mainly increased growth trends are obvious. At higher altitude sites, however, almost all sites show a slightly decreased growth potential during the last decades. It seems that at higher altitudes in Central Europe, environmental changes in the recent past with negative effects on cambial activity are the predominant growth influences. This is also reflected in short-term growth disturbances and growth depressions after 1975 in tree ring series of beech trees growing on higher altitude sites. The investigation of climate-growth relations by different dendroecological methods results in distinct altitude-dependent growth-limiting factors. The comparison of chronologies demonstrates a high resistance of beech at sites where water supply is the main growth controlling factor. Strong disturbances and depressions in radial increment, however, were found at higher altitude sites in Central Europe especially at the end of the 1970s. Comparisons with reactions in preceding years demonstrate an increased sensitivity or an affected 'ecological fitness'. Site factors modify the intensity of damage symptoms, but cannot be regarded as primary causes. Recent environmental changes may be responsible for the reduced 'ecological fitness' of Common beech in higher altitude sites. The spatial and temporal distribution of the detected growth disturbances leads to the assumption that increased tropospheric ozone concentrations are involved in the process of a changed sensitivity and resistance.

AB  - The Gulf of Mexico (GOM) produces 5% of total U.S. dry gas production (USEIA, 2016). Despite this, the proportion of microbial and thermogenic methane in discovered and producing fields from this area is still not well understood. Understanding the relative contributions of these sources in subsurface environments is important to understanding how and where economically substantial amounts of methane form. In addition, this information will help identify sources of environmental emissions of hydrocarbons to the atmosphere. We apply stable isotopes including methane clumped-isotope measurements to solution and associated gases from several producing fields in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to estimate the proportions, properties and origins of microbial and thermogenic endmembers. Clumped isotopes of methane are unique indicators of whether methane is at thermodynamic isotopic equilibrium or affected by kinetic processes. The clumped methane thermometer can provide insights into formation temperatures and/or into kinetic processes such as microbial methanogenesis, early catagenetic processes, mixing, combinatorial processes, and diffusion. In this data set, we find that some fluids have clumped isotope methane apparent temperatures consistent with the methane component being produced solely by the thermogenic breakdown of larger organic molecules at substantially greater temperatures than those reached in shallow reservoirs. A portion of these reservoirs with hot clumped isotope methane temperatures are consistent with exhibiting a kinetic isotope effect. Other reservoirs have clumped isotope methane apparent temperatures, and other isotopic and molecular proportions, consistent with mixtures of microbial and thermogenic methane. We show that in certain cases the evidence is most consistent with formation of the microbial methane in the current reservoir. However, in other cases the methane is produced at significantly shallower depths and is then transported to greater depths as a result of post generation burial of methane bearing sedimentary sequences to the current reservoir conditions. For the first time, we show that methane of an unambiguously purely microbial origin (i.e. those that do not contain obvious contributions of thermogenic methane) is dominantly generated at temperatures less than 60 degrees C, despite burial to greater depths. This finding suggests that, while microorganisms are able to generate methane at temperatures up to 105 degrees C under laboratory conditions (Brock, 1985), in the Gulf of Mexico, microbial methane is dominantly produced in the 20-60 degrees C window.

AB  - Although copper (Cu) is an essential element for life, leaching from boat paint can cause excess environmental loading in enclosed marinas. The effects of copper contamination on benthic macrofaunal communities were examined in three San Diego Bay marinas (America's Cup, Harbor Island West and East) in Southern California, USA. The distribution of Cu concentration in sediments exhibited a clear spatial gradient, with hotspots created by the presence of boats, which in two marinas exceeded the effect range medium (ERM). Elevated sediment Cu was associated with differences in benthic assemblages, reduced species richness and enhanced dominance in America's Cup and Harbor Island West, whereas Harbor Island East did not appear to be affected. At sites without boats there were greater abundances of some amphipods such as the species Desdimelita sp., Harpinia sp., Aoroides sp., Corophium sp., Podocerus sp., bivalves such as Lyonsia californica, Musculista senhousia, Macoma sp., and polychaetes such as Diplocirrus sp. In contrast, at sites with boats, densities of Pseudopolydora paucibranchiata, Polydora nuchalis, Euchone limnicola, Exogone lourei, Tubificoides spp. were enhanced. The limited impact on Harbor Island East suggests not only lower Cu input rates and increased water flushing and mixing, but also the presence of adequate defense mechanisms that regulate availability and mitigate toxic impacts. At all three marinas, Cu in tissues of several macrobenthic species exhibited Cu bioaccumulation above levels found in the surrounding environment. The annelids Lumbrineris sp. and Tubificoides spp., and the amphipod Desdimelita sp. contained high levels of Cu, suggesting they function as Cu bioaccumulators. The spionid polychaetes Polydora nuchalis and Pseudopolydora paucibranchiata had much lower Cu concentrations than surrounding sediments, suggesting they function as Cu bioregulators. The macrobenthic invertebrates in San Diego Bay marinas that tolerate Cu pollution (e.g. P.nuchalis, P.paucibranchiata, Euchone limnicola, Typosyllis sp., Tubificoides sp.) may function as indicators of high-Cu conditions, whereas the presence of Cu-sensitive species (e.g. Podocerus sp., Aoroides sp., Harpinia sp., Macoma sp., Lyonsia californica) may indicate healthier conditions (less Cu-stressed). Parallel responses by faunas of Shelter Island Yacht Basin, also in San Diego Bay, suggest potential for development of regional Cu contamination assessment criteria, and call for functional comparisons with other marinas and coastal water bodies.

AB  - Flow regime and total suspended solids (TSS), along with chemical and biological parameters associated with urbanization and intensive agriculture/aquaculture, impact benthic organisms, which represents the food chain foundation in aquatic systems. We designed this experiment to begin the integration of physical flow regime effects along with chemical and biological indicators on periphyton, an important benthic organism indicator, towards a goal of using periphyton (live biomass containing chlorophyll a) and pheophytin (dead chlorophyll-containing biomass) in assessments of stream health. Physical flow regimes in a laboratory flume were created using multiple roughness conditions and an in-channel weir. Results suggested that one could model the hydraulic regime with a hydraulic model, HEC-RAS, to within 2% to 11% of measured velocity values. Thus, one may roughly but not precisely move computed velocities from the flume to the field. Significant interactions between biological response and hydraulic and TSS factors were observed, and the study suggested several indicators of periphyton-pheophytin response that are potentially relevant to ecological engineering applications featuring a channel. Increased mean velocities significantly reduced (P < 0.05) live periphyton and filament length. The 200 mg L-1 TSS level significantly reduced (P < 0.05) biomass and filament development. The effect of TSS was least where velocity was highest and depth was most shallow, which had the least effect on light absorption and resulted in the least sediment deposition. The intermediate TSS level (100 mg L-1) appeared to stimulate a growth response based on periphyton and filament length, although the effect was less noticeable where velocities were higher. Pheophytin tended to be highest in conditions resulting in lower periphyton values, consistent with the notion that regimes imparting physical stress would harbor the highest concentration of pheophytin. The periphyton/filament length ratio tended to be lowest in velocities less than 0.75 m s(-1) except in the high TSS case, where both periphyton and filament length were low. Low velocities and low to moderate TSS would provide the most biomass for grazing organisms and would result in the most effective nutrient filtering due to long filament length. High periphyton/pheophytin ratios were associated with high TSS, velocities exceeding similar to 0.5 m s(-1), or both. Sloughing could occur in systems with a pulsing velocity where the pulse period was long enough for growth to occur in the quiescent interval.

AB  - Different statistical techniques were applied in an attempt to relate the physical and chemical variables of river water to the distribution of aquatic plants. The results show a low frequency of occurrence of aquatic plants (only 13 species were found) distributed over 53 sampling sites. A few plants were found in river headwaters with pronounced slopes: these had turbulent, non-polluted waters with high oxygen concentration, but with high mineral content (minimum conductivity value 200 mu S/cm). Plants were more abundant and frequent in sites with high organic loads in sampling sites located downstream of a small dam. The range of eutrophic conditions or mineral concentration over which plants were found was different from other European rivers, suggesting that the possible indicative nature of the species may differ. The presence of aquatic plants is related to chloride, which favours plant growth, and ammonium, which has a negative effect. A characteristic of the rivers studied, especially in middle and downstream zones, is the high chloride concentration associated with high nutrient content and correlated with the occurrence of aquatic macrophytes. However, the concentration of ammonium, an ion which is derived mostly from wastes (pollution), is associated with the absence of plants. This may indicate that the ammonium concentration is toxic to aquatic plants. In this sense, the presence of aquatic plants indicates an absence of toxic effects from pollution (due to urban and industrial dumping). It is possible to relate the presence of aquatic plants to the conditions of eutrophy and alteration of the environment and, hence, to use these plants, to a limited degree, as indicators of the degree of contamination or degradation of the rivers of Biscay. The following indicative character for the listed species are proposed: Apium nodiflorum is a species characteristic of zones with high nutrient concentrations; Groenlandia densa, Zannichellia palustris and Alisma plantago-aquatica are all indicative of clean and more or less stagnant waters; the presence of Lemna minor is generally associated with water of greater depth, less current velocity and high nutrient content, generally places affected by human intervention; Veronica beccabunga and Potamogeton pectinatus are characteristic of back-flowing and mesoeutrophic streams. Nasturtium afficinale in our study inhabits clean and oxygenated waters and would therefore be indicative of such areas. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

AB  - Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in eggshells and feathers of Little Egret (Egratta Garzetta) as well as in environmental compartments were investigated to assess the bioindication potential of non-destructive tissues of predatory birds for persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in wetlands. Higher concentrations of PAHs were detected in both feathers and eggshells than OCPs, which was consistent with the residue patterns in water, soil and food samples. Bioaccumulation was observed for both OCPs and PAHs in eggshells and feathers showing OCPs were more readily bioaccumulated than PAHs, mainly attributed to the bioconcentration route from water. Both eggshells and feathers of Little Egret could be used to predict the POP pollution in Poyang Lake wetlands, especially for PAHs. The higher bioaccumulation potential of feathers than eggshells suggests the wide application of feathers as non-destructive biomonitoring tool for particular POP pollution in wetland ecosystem.

AB  - We show that probability-based environmental resource monitoring programs, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S. EPA) Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program, and conditional probability analysis can serve as a basis for estimating ecological risk over broad geographic areas. Under certain conditions (including appropriate stratification of the sampled population, sufficient density of samples, and sufficient range of exposure levels paired with concurrent response values), this empirical approach provides estimates of risk using extant field-derived monitoring data. The monitoring data were used to prescribe the exposure field and to model the exposure response relationship. We illustrate this approach by estimating risks to benthic communities from low dissolved oxygen (DO) in freshwater streams of the mid-Atlantic region and in estuaries of the Virginian Biogeographical Province of the United States. In both cases, the estimates of risk are consistent with the U.S. EPA's ambient water quality criteria for DO. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2011;30:1488-1495. (C) 2011 SETAC

AB  - We review psychoneuroimmunological research linking coping with HIV disease progression and its indicators, as well as with viral and host factors that may mediate or contribute to HIV progression. Our perspective on coping broadly encompasses the attempts of multiple mental and biological systems to adapt to changing internal and environmental conditions and to reestablish homeostasis. Accordingly, we discuss studies within four dimensions of coping: cognitive (appraisals, expectancies, and explanatory style), emotional (the Type C coping pattern and related constructs), active-passive strategies and behavior patterns, and physiological (autonomic reactivity and recovery). Finally, we present a model that integrates key studies linking coping with HIV prognostic indicators and clinical disease progression. Based on empirical evidence, the model suggests plausible mechanisms by which coping may be connected to HIV progression/antiprogression factors and immunopathogenesis to affect HIV clinical progression.

AB  - A mature pedogenic carbonate horizon (Stage IV) has developed in a fine-grained soil above Pliocene-Miocene alluvial gravels derived from Cretaceous limestone of the Stockton Plateau, and Paleozoic limestone, chert, and novaculite from the Marathon uplift. Other calcic soil horizons have been age-dated in the southwestern U.S. using a soil developmental index. However, this soil is located in an area classified by the Soil Conservation Service as having marginal conditions for pedogenic carbonate accumulation at the present. These marginal conditions are attributed either to climatic conditions that are too moist or to the presence of non-pedogenic carbonate accumulations in soil. We examined the carbonate question by applying soil morphologic, electron microprobe, and stable isotopic analyses to assess the carbonate origin of the soil horizon, The soil morphology indicates that the calcic soil in question has developed an average 109 cm thick K horizon below surface depths of 68-80 cm, In gravelly areas of the soil a 15-20 cm thick laminar Km horizon caps the K horizon. Microprobe analyses on portions of the Km horizon show that CaCO3 is the dominant material present and displaced the clays forming laminar and pisolith features. The carbonate chemistry of the Km horizon is dominated by CaCO3 (98 percent by weight) with minor amounts of MgCO3 (0.7 parts per million). Bulk isotopic analyses were run on the K horizon and local Cretaceous (Segovia) limestone. delta(18)O differences between the K and Km horizons (-3.0 to -1.7 parts per thousand) and local limestone (-6.1 to -4.9 parts per thousand) indicate the K and Km horizon carbonates are the result of soil processes. Transects across Km coated limestone clasts show an delta(18)O shift of 2-4 parts per thousand across the soil-rock interface. After ruling out atmospheric mixing and isotopic inheritance from limestone as factors influencing isotopic composition, the delta(13)O results (-3.4 to 1.4 parts per thousand) are interpreted as reflecting carbonate precipitation in a C-4 vegetative environment. These results imply pedogenesis is responsible for the carbonate in the soil. Thus, a calcic soil development index can be applied to obtain an age-date. The index analysis yielded an average amount of secondary carbonate of 92 g/cm(2) for the K horizon in the soil resulting in an average soil development age of 180 +/-20 Kyr, These results correlate well with other Stage IV K horizons in west Texas and southern New Mexico.

AB  - Habitat restoration requires realistic goals. To naturally regenerate European lowland calcareous grassland, whose extent has severely declined, over a century may be required for vegetation to become indistinguishable from that of old calcareous grassland. Progress of natural regeneration can be characterized using member species of the reference vegetation as indicators of favourable site condition. Chronosequence studies have suggested that calcareous-grassland species differ predictably in their ability to colonize ex-arable land, with some usually colonizing early on, and others in later stages. If such patterns are affected by gradually-attenuating establishment limitation, this would have important implications for restoration practice and indication of progress. Particularly, late-colonizing species might be better indicators of favourable site conditions than early colonizers.
   To explore these aspects, we have reanalysed chronosequence data previously used to investigate causal mechanisms affecting calcareous-grassland restoration progress. We carried out an indicator species analysis to determine which species are indicative of particular stages of natural regeneration. Using correlation analyses, we tested whether species colonization patterns matched those found by previous chronosequence studies that were geographically more limited or relied on more informal approaches to determine species order of colonization. Correlation analyses were also used to test whether order of colonization could be explained by establishment limitation or by dispersal limitation, or by established plant strategies that underlie such limitations.
   We identified 30 species as indicative of particular stages of natural regeneration, including nine that specifically indicate old calcareous grassland. Correlation results confirmed high congruence with species order of colonization in previous chronosequence studies, and indicated that establishment limitation plays a role in shaping species order of colonization, potentially mediated through differential stress tolerance. We failed to demonstrate a role of dispersal limitation in shaping order of colonization. Based on our results, we derived three categories of indicator species for passively-restored calcareous grassland, mirroring the regeneration stage during which these species usually colonize. This includes a category labelled by us as 'old-grassland indicators' that achieve notable abundance only in old grassland. We conclude by discussing how such a categorization can benefit the measurement of restoration progress, the tentative identification of old grassland and its conservation, e.g. through linking agri-environment payments to the occurrence of old-grassland indicators, thus fostering positive change in farmer attitudes towards old grassland.

AB  - The 11 m sediment core of karstic Lake Vrana located at the Dalmatian coast of Eastern Adriatic (Croatia) was investigated through the analyses of diatoms. The diatoms exhibited six marked changes in Diatom Zones (DZ) with included water/sediment interface, as the record of environmental changes detected by marine and other terrestrial palaeoclimate records. The diatoms recorded at the deepest sediments were interpreted to represent Pleistocene/Holocene transition. The dated Holocene history is top 810 cm core section, ca. 8.1 cal kyr BP to the present. The first zone record (1101-1050 cm) was interpreted as alkaline, oligo-mesotrophic, oxic lentic ecosystem of the karstic flooding plain based on the dominance of Epithemia adnata. Enhanced bioproductivity of the shallow and unstable environment was noticed in the second diatom zone (1050-815 cm), which was interpreted as the beginning of the Holocene and it was divided into 4 subzones because of rapid environmental fluctuations. A warmer period of temperate climate with a pluvial phase initiated development of the oligo-beta mesosaprobic shallow lake in the early Holocene. The expansion of the macrophytes and higher cyanobacteria production that caused acidification and oxygen depletion at the lake bottom was determined in the mid-Holocene (810-713 cm; 8.1-7.1 cal kyr BP). Mid-Holocene (8.1-4.7 cal kyr BP) is marked by oligohalobic freshwater Epithemia argus characteristic for alkaline water. High cyanobacteria production was determined as a consequence of algal production that induced anoxic conditions in the lake bottom sediments from the warmer period till today. The initial marine influx through the permeable karst underground was observed in the sediment record from ca. 5 cal kyr BP. The discovered marine influence on the lake indicating brackish water conditions related to the Holocene sea-level high stand. The sea intrusion had different intensities through time and is still observed today in the seasonal fluctuation of lake water salinity. The Late Holocene (2.7 cal kyr BP to the present) sediment record is characterized with the strongest marine influxes and highest biodiversity of the beta mesosaprobic lake. Major changes in the water/sediment interface of very shallow karstic lake were caused by anthropogenic agricultural activity in Vrana. Diatom compositions of Lake Vrana indicate that they are sensitive to both paleoclimatic changes, freshwater influx and sea level rise (marine intrusion through permeable karst).

AB  - Persistent organic compounds exhibit declining extractability and bioavailability to microorganisms and other soil organisms with increasing contact time or ageing. Among the possible mechanisms are the association of organic compounds with natural organic matter. Ageing can reduce the negative effects that an organic pollutant may have on the biological, biochemical properties and phytotoxicity of the contaminated soil. The aim of the present work was to evaluate, under laboratory conditions, the response of an agricultural soil contaminated with phenanthrene (Phe) and subjected to 2-year ageing and the effects and potential remediation capabilities of compost and an effective Phe-degrading bacterial culture.
   A fresh agricultural soil was contaminated with Phe, supplemented with compost at two different rates and subjected to 2-year ageing under laboratory conditions. Phe was detected by HPLC analysis. The main biochemical and chemical properties of soil amended or not with compost were measured before and after the ageing process by using standard techniques. Germination tests were performed with Cucumis sativus L. and Lepidium sativum L.
   Significantly reduced amounts of Phe were extracted after 650 days and a greater amount of Phe accumulated in the soil humic fractions and preferentially in the humin-mineral fraction. A decrease of the extractable Phe from the 650-day aged samples occurred in the presence of the Phe-degrading bacterial culture but only after further 21-50 days of incubation. A similar decrease was measured also in the non-inoculated samples. The higher values of arylsulphatase and phosphatase measured after 650 days of incubation seem to indicate that the indigenous bacteria of the soil adapted to and survived the presence of the aged Phe, also because of its possible reduced toxicity. A little residual phytotoxicity was still measured indicating that the low amount of available Phe was high enough to reduce the germination of the two plant species.
   The results support that complex phenomena occur in a soil when a contaminant is present and persist for long time in it. The higher amounts of Phe extracted by the humic fractions indicate that ageing of Phe actually occurred and was favoured by the presence of the high level of organic matter in the soil. Tested parameters showed different response to the presence of aged compound. Therefore, the choice of the biochemical parameter to use as indicator of soil quality might be crucial for obtaining correct and easily interpretable results.

AB  - Aim Water pH and conductivity are known to be major environmental factors controlling the species composition of nutrient-poor wetlands. Based on the analysis of two large data sets of species co-occurrence, sampled along the entire pH/calcium gradient, we explored whether species exhibit similar or different ecological behaviour in the two regions.
   Location West Carpathians (central Europe) and Bulgaria (south-eastern Europe), situated 800 km apart. Bulgaria represents a range margin for many mire species.
   Methods The probability of occurrence of the 41 most common species along the pH and conductivity gradients was assessed using logistic regression fitted by means of generalized additive models. The species optimum and amplitude were determined. To check the possible effect of competitive release, we estimated where the potential maximum number of species (maximum overlap in realized niches) occurs along the base richness gradient.
   Results Most of the 41 frequently occurring species showed a significant response to water pH and ln-transformed conductivity (approximating total mineral richness) in both regions. Eight species showed a shift in pH optimum greater than one unit, while 12 species showed the same or a larger shift along the conductivity gradient. Nearly all these striking shifts were connected to an extension of species tolerance towards mineral-poor acid habitats in Bulgaria, which causes links between species and measured factors to be conspicuously weaker in Bulgaria than in the West Carpathians. Regarding ecological amplitude, 24 species exhibited a wider tolerance to water conductivity in the West Carpathians, whereas 17 species exhibited a wider tolerance in Bulgaria.
   Main conclusions A distinctive variation in the realized niche was observed in a large portion of the species examined. Niche shifts between local populations of the same species were similar to those of closely related vicariant species. Ecotypic adaptation within species is a possible explanation for this pattern. Other possible explanations (competitive release, specific habitat conditions, compensation for climate) seem to be less justified. The local populations of rich-fen species may have adapted to mineral-poor acid conditions in the high crystalline mountains of Bulgaria during dry periods of pleniglacials.

AB  - In recent years, the remote sensing based on meteorological satellite observations has become an important tool for assessing global ecological conditions. Since the early 2000, Fengyun (FY) satellite data have been widely used to derive the key parameters of ecological environment in China. An integrated earth-observation system has been developed in China through using FY satellite data, including retrievals the key ecological parameters as well as to constructions of long-term data records of vegetation index, land surface temperature, net primary production, vegetation health index, and so on. Considerable progress has thus been made in the application and service for prevention of air pollution, management and control of ecological redline, ecological monitoring for the Belt and Road Initiative, and assessment of ecological environment for human settlement. In order to monitor the ecological parameters in real time and with a full dynamic coverage, it is necessary to improve the technology in application of ecological remote sensing from meteorological satellites, and further enhance the ecological meteorological service.

AB  - Past climate variations on Earth are recorded in sedimentary rocks by chemical and biological indicators. In this sense, investigations of sedimentary marine barites (BaSO4) have been fundamental to reconstruct geochemical evolution of palaeoenvironments. Despite the significant advances achieved during the past decade, the mechanism of barite formation in the ocean water column in undersaturated conditions and the role of microorganisms remain controversial. Phosphorus-rich, amorphous precursor phases have been suggested to play a key role, although the exact mechanism of marine barite formation from this precursor is not well constrained. In this paper, we evidence that barite can precipitate by replacing amorphous Ba-P pre-cursor phases formed in the absence of living organisms. This occurs by a mineral replacement reaction, yielding an abiotic scenario for barite particles with morphologies, mesostructure and composition resembling barite formed in the marine water column. This demonstrates the need to investigate how this formation process, via the replacement of an amorphous precursor, affects the isotopic and trace element signatures of barite, and how this influences the environmental information obtained from this proxy.

AB  - Heavy metals are one of the most hazardous pollutants in marine environments because of their bioaccumulation and biomagnification capabilities. Among them, cadmium (Cd) has been considered as one of the most dangerous for marine organisms. Here we incubated Ammonia cf. parkinsoniana specimens, a benthic foraminiferal taxon used in previous experiments, for up to 48 h in natural seawater with different concentrations of Cd to unravel the physiological change. We document a reduced pseudopodial activity of the Cd-treated specimens at concentrations >10-100 ppb in comparison with the control specimens. Moreover, confocal images of Cd-treated specimens using Nile Red as a fluorescent probe reveal an enhanced intracellular neutral lipid accumulation in the form of lipid droplets at 6 h and 12 h. This bioassay experiment allows for the direct evaluation of Cd-dose to A. cf. parkinsoniana-response relationships under laboratory controlled conditions and provides complementary information to field observations as well as to water quality guidelines and thresholds.

AB  - The threats to small urban streams lead to a decrease in their water quality and dysregulate their ecological balance, thereby affecting the biodiversity and causing degradation of indicators that determine the ecological potential. The aim of our study was to determine the impact of abiotic conditions induced by intensive human activity on the community structures of invertebrates (zooplankton and macroinvertebrates) in the small urban stream Bukowka in the Szczecin agglomeration (NW Poland). This stream exhibits the same characteristics as a large river, in which the mass of live organic matter increases with their length. The composition of invertebrates (zooplankton and macroinvertebrates) was strongly influenced by the changes caused by humans in the stream bed. The construction of small reservoirs and bed regulation in this small urban streams had a similar effect on the quality of the water and ecological potential as in large rivers, but at a lower scale.

AB  - The effect of sexual selection on species persistence remains unclear. The cost of bearing ornaments or armaments might increase extinction risk, but sexual selection can also enhance the spread of beneficial alleles and increase the removal of deleterious alleles, potentially reducing extinction risk. Here we investigate the effect of sexual selection on species persistence in a community of 34 species of dung beetles across a gradient of environmental disturbance ranging from old growth forest to oil palm plantation. Horns are sexually selected traits used in contests between males, and we find that both horn presence and relative size are strongly positively associated with species persistence and abundance in altered habitats. Testes mass, an indicator of post-copulatory selection, is, however, negatively linked with the abundance of species within the most disturbed habitats. This study represents the first evidence from a field system of a population-level benefit from pre-copulatory sexual selection.

AB  - We test several methods of ostracod-based palaeoenvironmental reconstruction using indicator species approach, mutual ecological/climatic range methods, transfer functions, modern analogue technique and morphological variation within Cyprideis torosa in reconstructing the site evolution of a late Quaternary small lake basin in Thuringia, Central Germany. Sediment sections containing a diverse ostracod fauna were studied and compared with those from modern water bodies of Thuringia. Palynological investigations were executed to reconstruct the environmental conditions in the catchment area and for a obtaining a biostratigraphical framework. The brackish water ostracod Cyprideis torosa as well as the foraminifer Haplophragmoides indicate phases of saline groundwater influence, fed by salt bearing sediments of the Triassic basement. The accompanying freshwater ostracod fauna, however, reflects only low variations of salinity and temperature. Environmental changes in salinity, temperature and ecological stability indicated by microfossils and pollen are caused by an interplay of climatic shifts and the local geological and hydrological setting.

AB  - The objective was to determine the spatial-temporal distribution of total mercury (T-Hg) bioavailability at the Goiana Estuary using Anomalocardia brasiliana as model organism. Two seasons (rainy in February and dry in August), three habitats of the tidal flats (upper, middle and lower) and two size classes (<20 mm and >20 mm) were considered. In addition, depurated and non-depurated samples were tested. Individuals (N = 600) were pooled in samples representing the combinations of the above situations. T-Hg in the tissues of the pooled samples of A. brasiliana from Goiana Estuary varied from 0.06 and 0.18 mu g g(-1) dry weight. Significant differences occurred between treatments (P < 0.05). In average (10-30%), after depuration T-Hg concentrations decreased, especially at the tidal flat areas most exposed to tidal variations (upper and middle). There were no significant differences between seasons or size classes.

AB  - River erosion combined with the settling and sedimentation of deposits contributed to silting of the original meanders, cutting them off and forming two oxbow lakes. After the floods in 1997 and 2010 the valley of the meandering Odra River underwent further changes concerning water and sediment qualities. Since that time the quality of both water and sediments has been gradually improving, similar to that of surface waters. The analysis of water quality measurement results for the Odra at Chalupki showed that the values of water temperature, reaction, ammonia, and electrolytic conductivity do not exceed the limiting levels for class I. It appears that the Odra waters are not sensitive to pollution by nitrogen compounds from agricultural sources. The measurements of water sampled from the Odra show that indicators such as water temperature, dissolved oxygen, reaction, nitrites, and ammonia nitrogen meet the requirements for inland waters being the living environment for fish from the Salmonidae and the Cyprinidae families in natural conditions.

AB  - An index, based on littoral communities assemblages (CARLIT), was applied to assess the ecological status of Northwestern Mediterranean coastal waters, following the requirements of the European Water Framework Directive. The biogeographical particularities of the Alboran Sea suggested a reassessment of this index, and that was the main objective of this work. Due to these biogeographical particularities, two regions were proposed in the studied region, with new reference conditions for each region. Subsequently, by means of a multivariate analysis, littoral community abundances and the CARLIT index were compared with factors related to geomorphology, biogeography and anthropogenic pressures. Overall, the biogeographical component determined the distribution of littoral communities. In contrast, the ecological status yielded by the index only was significantly related to anthropogenic pressures. The results pointed out that the reassessment of the CARLIT index was suitable to evaluate the ecological status of the Alboran Sea. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Lobau, a former floodplain area of the Danube River situated within the city limits of Vienna (Austria), was strongly affected by the river regulation in 1875. The reduced hydrological connectivity led to an increasing loss of aquatic habitats. A water enhancement scheme with a maximum water input of 0.5 m(3) s(-1) was initiated in 2001. The present study assesses the effect of this scheme on biodiversity using three target species groups - aquatic molluscs, dragonflies and fish - following a common Before-After Control-impact design (BACI). Dragonflies and molluscs were positively affected, reflecting the habitat alterations in the system. For fish. no significant impact was observed. The aim of the scheme has been achieved: increased habitat diversity and improved habitat conditions for the system's initial community and further rheophilic/rheotolerant species. Water enhancement schemes can be effective remediation measures and deserve further attention in the management of urban wetlands. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - An ecological impact study was performed based on in situ biomarker assays with the waterflea Daphnia magna. The effects of metallurgic effluents on the energy metabolism, anti-oxidative metabolism and DNA damage were assessed in caged daphnids during a 4-week study. In situ survival and reproduction studies demonstrated a clear impact on these parameters in organisms exposed in the most polluted areas. At the downstream-sublethal-zone the organisms were disturbed within their tolerance limits, resulting in alterations of their energy metabolism. These data Suggest an acclimation hypothesis, which was tested through the analysis of the energy metabolism of resident species: isopods and amphipods. These organisms had shifted to a decrease in their overall energy metabolism compared to the upstream region. This change in some biochemical processes suggests a selective advantage to cope with the prevailing environmental conditions. In addition, we found clear genotoxic effects caused by the industrial discharges that might correlate with a reduction in (long-term) survival. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BIOMARKERS are of great value in petroleum exploration because they provide essential information about the geological history of oils and source rocks.  Steranes 1 are of particular importance as they can be related to naturally occurring precursors 2, 3.  These compounds generally experience intense biodegradation, however, which alters their original distribution 4-6 and obscures the information that they carry regarding oil maturity and source material.  In an attempt to identify the microorganisms responsible for this degradation, we have investigated the capacity of 73 aerobic bacteria to degrade steranes present in Rozel Point (Utah) oil 7.  Seven Gram-positive strains, belonging to a limited number of genera, were found to be active.  Using Nocardia sp. SEBR 16, which caused the most extensive alteration, we have determined biodegradation rates for several isomers of steranes and methylsteranes.  The preference for alteration of different isomers reflects that observed in natural environments, suggesting that the degradation intermediates could be used as indicators of the extent of the biodegradation in an oil.  In addition, the microorganisms used here might be effective in biodegrading oil spills.

AB  - Durability-based designs with timber require reliable information about the wood properties and how they affect its performance under variable exposure conditions. This study aimed at utilizing a material resistance model (Part 2 of this publication) based on a dose-response approach for predicting the relative decay rates in above-ground situations. Laboratory and field test data were, for the first time, surveyed globally and used to determine material-specific resistance dose values, which were correlated to decay rates. In addition, laboratory indicators were used to adapt the material resistance model to in-ground exposure. The relationship between decay rates in- and above-ground, the predictive power of laboratory indicators to predict such decay rates, and a method for implementing both in a service life prediction tool, were established based on 195 hardwoods, 29 softwoods, 19 modified timbers, and 41 preservative-treated timbers.

AB  - The skin of vertebrates acts as a biological barrier defending the organism against many harmful environmental factors. It is well established that the main stress hormone cortisol, together with antioxidants such as melatonin (Mel) and its biologically active metabolites set up a local stress response system in the mammalian skin. Recently, our research group has shown that in fish there are basic conditions for the functioning of a cutaneous stress response system (CSRS) similar to that in mammals, where Mel with its biologically active metabolite AFMK (N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine) and cortisol act together to protect organism against unfavorable environment. Since aquaculture is making an increasing contribution to the global economy and new laws are demanding people to respect the welfare requirements of animals there has been increasing interest in indicators of fish well-being in aquaculture.

AB  - There is ongoing debate on the overlap between Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), particularly regarding emotion dysregulation (ED). In this paper, we present a narrative review of the available evidence on the association of these two disorders from several standpoints. First, we discuss the unique and shared diagnostic criteria for ADHD and BPD, focusing particularly on ED. We consider the methodology of ecological momentary assessment and discuss why this approach could be an alternative and more accurate way to qualitatively distinguish between ADHD and BPD. We summarise key findings on the genetic and environmental risk factors for ADHD and BPD and the extent to which there are shared or unique aetiological and neurobiological risk factors. Finally, we discuss the clinical relevance of considering both disorders in the assessment of patients presenting with trait-like behavioural syndromes, distinguishing the two conditions and implications for treatment.

AB  - Brown-water dystrophic lakes have several limnological characteristics that clearly separate them from clear-water oligotrophic and murky eutrophic lakes. In this study, I examined the sedimentary midge (Nematocera) assemblages from 30 shallow boreal lakes of varying humic status to test the influence of dystrophy on community composition. The results indicate differing community assemblages between oligohumic and humic lakes. Several taxa were restricted to clear-water lakes, whereas dystrophic lakes also had their characteristic taxa, which were rare or absent in the clear-water lakes. The most common and abundant nematocerans having statistically significant indicator values for dystrophy were chironomids Zalutschia zalutschicola-type, Tanytarsus mendax-type, and Cladotanytarsus mancus-type, together with the phantom midge Chaoborus flavicans. These results indicate that the level of dystrophy plays a significant role in determining midge distribution in boreal lakes. Therefore, consideration of differences in humic conditions is crucial to contemporary midge-based environmental assessments and long-term paleolimnological investigations, because temporal changes in the humic state may have occurred.

AB  - Reliable and repeatable field sampling methods are needed for monitoring ecosystem optical properties linked to carbon flux. Here we describe a tram system, consisting of a dual-detector spectrometer mounted on a robotic cart for mobile sampling of ecosystem spectral reflectance. To illustrate the application of this system for monitoring dynamic ecosystem activity, we illustrate how the tram can be used for exploring the multiple factors influencing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a measure of vegetation greenness and a key optical indicator of vegetation carbon dioxide assimilation. With this system, we collected five years of NDVI data for a chaparral ecosystem in Southern California subject to extreme disturbance. Key factors affecting NDVI at this site included snow cover, sky conditions (clear vs. cloudy), time of day, season, species composition, and environmental perturbations such as rainfall, drought and fire. Applications of this tram system include ecosystem monitoring, satellite validation, and developing surface-atmosphere flux models from remote sensing. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plant susceptibility to acidifying atmospheric pollution was investigated for a wide range of plant species under normal environmental conditions. Physiological and biochemical parameters were recorded for each plant species. Multivariate analysis using hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis ordination, as well as regression analysis were used to interpret the data. Analysis of the data separated plants into pioneer tree species, ruderal herbaceous species and climax, slow growing species. Pioneer and ruderal species shelved higher potential for foliar nitrate assimilation coupled with higher base cation content and a tendency to a more neutral leaf pH than climax species. Acidic buffering capacities for leaf tissue from pioneer and ruderal species were higher than those of climax species. Nitrate assimilation produces hydroxyl ions, which in conjunction with high base cation content and more neutral leaf pH, provides better metabolic buffering and therefore make pioneer and ruderal species less susceptible to acidifying inputs. Climax species are less able to buffer against acidifying inputs and ave subsequently more prone to acidifying air pollution damage.

AB  - Contamination by metals is among the most pervasive anthropogenic threats to the environment. Despite the ecological importance of marine apex predators, the potential negative impacts of metal bioaccumulation and biomagnification on the health of higher trophic level species remains unclear. To date, most toxicology studies in sharks have focused on measuring metal concentrations in muscle tissues associating human consumption and food safety, without further investigating potential impacts on shark health. To help address this knowledge gap, the present study evaluated metal concentrations in the gills, muscle, liver and rectal gland of coastal sharks opportunistically sampled from Brazilian waters and tested for potential relationships between metal bioaccumulation and general shark health and homeostatic balance metrics. Results revealed high metal concentrations in all four tissue types, with levels varying in relation to size, sex, and life-stage. Metal concentrations were also associated with serum biomarkers (urea, lactate, ALT, triglycerides, alkaline phosphatase, and phosphorus) and body condition, suggesting potential negative impacts on organismal health.

AB  - A common practice in tact training is to include a supplemental verbal stimulus (e.g., "What is it?") in addition to the presentation of a nonverbal discriminative stimulus. Previous literature has suggested that this supplemental verbal stimulus can impede acquisition and generalization relative to the presentation of the object alone, as it may establish faulty stimulus control or decrease spontaneous tacting. Research has yet to compare these 2 training methods on the generalization of learned tacts to more naturalistic, play-based environments. The present study evaluated the use of "What is it?" compared to the presentation of only the nonverbal discriminative stimulus on tact acquisition among 3 children with autism spectrum disorder and the extent to which these training procedures led to tacting in a play-based setting following discrete-trial training. Overall, participants learned to tact stimuli under both conditions, and all participants demonstrated generalization of tacts in a play-based setting. Recommendations for the development and evaluation of naturalistic posttraining assessment are discussed.

AB  - Pressure-based approach, morphoedaphic index and historical data were used in deriving reference conditions and classification criteria for the Estonian large lakes: Peipsi and Vortsjarv. The comparison of the measured total phosphorus with the reference level based on the morphoedaphic index, shows that the water quality could be estimated as 'moderate' in lake Peipsi and 'good' in Vortsjarv despite that the measured TP values were higher in the latter. Comparing the changes observed in different quality elements with the normative definitions for quality classes given in the Water Framework Directive yielded quality estimates from 'high'to 'moderate' for both lakes. Applying the "one-out all-out" principle according to which the ecological status is determined by the biological quality element, which shows the greatest anthropogenic disturbance, both lakes fall unequivocally into the 'moderate' category. Averaging the quality estimates for lakes Peipsi and Vortsjarv no matter whether on a quality element level or a single parameter level would indicate good status in both lakes that is close to the subjective cognitive expert opinion of the authors.

AB  - Although quarrying is often cited as a potential threat to wetland systems, there is a lack of relevant, quantitative case studies in the literature. The impact of pumped groundwater discharged from a quarry into a wetland area was assessed relative to reference conditions in an adjacent fen wetland that receives only natural runoff. Analysis of vegetation patterns at the quarry wetland site, using Detrended Correspondence Analysis and the species indicator values of Ellenberg, revealed a clear disparity between community transitions in the quarry wetland and the reference site. Limited establishment of moisture-sensitive taxa, the preferential proliferation of robust wetland species and an overall shift towards lower species diversity in the quarry wetland were explicable primarily by the physico-chemical environment created by quarry dewatering. This encompassed high pH (up to 12.8), sediment-rich effluent creating a nutrient-poor substrate with poor moisture retention in the quarry wetland, and large fluctuations in water levels.

AB  - The need for new tools to assess the environmental status of coastal and estuarine systems encouraged Borja et al. [Mar. Pollut. Bull. 40 (2000) 1100] to develop a new index, the AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI), which needs to be tested as much as possible in different geographical areas to assess its applicability. This index was applied in the Mondego estuary (western coast of Portugal) together with the Shannon-Wiener, Margalef, Simpson, and W-statistic indices, which are widely used in detecting the effects of marine pollution. Results show that, in some cases, the AMBI provides a more accurate assessment of environmental conditions than the other indices, which were influenced by the dominance of certain species, allowing us to consider it as a promising tool to characterize marine and estuarine environmental quality.

AB  - Aim: This study was conducted to evaluate the rotifer composition and abundance in lakes with different environmental characteristics in an attempt to identify the relationship between the rotifer community structure and environmental parameters.
   Methodology: Bimonthly samplings were carried out in Sembrong, Putrajaya and Subang lakes from April 2015 to February 2016. Duplicate rotifer samples were collected with a 60 pm mesh net using vertical hauls from about 30 cm from bottom to the surface, and preserved with 10% buffered formalin to produce 5% final solution for identification and enumeration. Physico-chemical parameters were measured in situ using YSI multi-parameter, and nutrient analyses were accomplished upon arrival in the laboratory of Marine Biotechnology, Universiti Putra Malaysia.
   Results: A recently created meso-eutrophic Putrajaya lake had the highest number of rotifer species (11 families and 28 species), followed by the hypereutrophic Sembrong lake (10 families and 24 species). In the acidic-mesotrophic lake, only 17 species of rotifers from nine families were found. In this acidic water-body, Ptygura libera was the most dominant species contributing to 76.1% of the total rotifer abundance. In Putrajaya lake, Keratella cochlearis contributed to 38.0% of rotifer populations followed by P. libera with 33.0%. Brachionus forficula and Brachionus calyciflorus were dominant in Sembrong lake which made up of 41.2% of total rotifer species. Putrajaya lake had highest density of rotifers with a total mean density of 239.4 +/- 30.3 ind. I-1 compared in Sembrong lake (158.7 +/- 16.6 ind. I-1) and Subang lake (58.9 +/- 18.5 ind. I-1). The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) scores indicated that the abundance of B. calyciflorus and B. forficula was related to the eutrophic condition associated with the high total phosphorus and chlorophyll a. Ptygura libera seemed to be associated in less nutrient rich waters, and seemed to be tolerant to acidic waters.
   Interpretation: This study illustrated that the dominance of rotifer species was related to the lake health status. The abundance of Brachionus, Keratelia and Trichocerca were related to the eutrophic condition associated with turbidity, total dissolved solid (TDS), chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations. Ptygura libera seemed to be associated with less nutrient rich water tolerant to acidic waters (pH 4-5).

AB  - Central European temperate forests are with the exception of floodplain forests relatively little invaded by alien plants. However, despite substantial recent progress, there is still a lack of using vegetation plot data for analyzing spatio-temporal patterns of alien tree species invasions.
   We calculated releve-based metrics of tree species' ecological preferences using 19,413 phytosociological forest releves of the Austrian vegetation database. We focused on the five most widely distributed alien trees, i.e. two archaeophytes (Castanea sativa, Juglans regia) and three neophytes (Acer negundo, Ailanthus altissima, Robinia pseudoacacia). For each of these species we analyzed the mean cover in the tree layer and the occurrence in the, herb and shrub layers in releves colonized by adult trees as a measure for persistence. Further, we evaluated the inter-generational ecological plasticity (= the ability of young trees to grow under different site conditions than adults) for the tree species, and the mean releve indicator values for light, nutrients, moisture and hemeroby. We then compared these alien and native tree species metrics.
   We found that A. altissima and R. pseudoacacia build up high mean cover values in invaded forests, but this was not the case for the other alien trees. Thus, both species strongly affected forest communities of invaded sites. Similarly, the two species were common in the lower vegetation layers indicating recruitment under the canopy of adult conspecifics; this was facilitated by their ability to produce root suckers. Highest values of inter-generational ecological plasticity occurred in native pioneer trees and species of softwood floodplain forests, while alien trees had moderately high (A. negundo, A. altissima, J. regia) to low values (C. sativa, R. pseudoacacia).With the exception of C. sativa, all alien species showed high mean Ellenberg indicator values for light and nutrients, and were more common in sites with high hemeroby and high mean Ellenberg indicator values for temperature. Distinct from the ecological preferences of alien trees, and thus rarely invaded, were montane beech forests, coniferous mountain forests and forests at extremely dry sites, as well as swamp and bog forests dominated by willows and ash.
   We conclude that releve-based metrics of the behavior of alien tree species allow new insights into the spatio-temporal dynamics of invasion of woody species in forests. Future work should expand this approach, e.g., by considering the role of life history traits and actual site conditions.

AB  - Diatom assemblage changes over the Holocene were examined from a C-14-dated sediment core retrieved from Lake TK-2, a small low Arctic lake located ca. 200 km north of the forest-tundra ecotone in mainland Nunavut, Canada. Notable changes in the diatom assemblages were recorded throughout the core, suggesting that the Holocene epoch in this region has been environmentally and climatically dynamic. The earliest diatom assemblages (ca. 9000 cal yr BP) were dominated by taxa that are atypical of post-glacial assemblages commonly recorded throughout the Arctic, and may suggest that early Holocene conditions at Lake TK-2 were relatively warmer. A shift to dominance by small, benthic, opportunistic Fragilaria taxa followed (after ca. 8550 cal. yr BP), more typical of Arctic assemblages during initial lake ontogeny, suggesting the onset of cooler, more alkaline conditions. An abrupt and short-lived marked decrease in diatoms between ca. 8550 and 8500 cal. yr BP, with corresponding changes in physical and chemical indicators (e.g., sedimentation rate, siliciclastic content, %organic matter content), provides potential evidence for the 8.2 k cooling anomaly, an event rarely recognized from other paleolimnological studies in the Canadian north. Following ca. 7000 cal. yr BP, a substantial shift occurred to a more complex and diverse diatom assemblage that now included more acidophilic taxa. This compositional change is likely indicative of a natural, long-term loss of alkalinity in the lake, and marks the onset of the Holocene Thermal Maximum, consistent with the timing of this warm period for this region. The relatively stable diatom assemblage composition during the Neoglacial period was punctuated by fluctuations in key species potentially correlative with the so-called Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age. In the most recent sediments, the post-industrial expansion of the small, planktonic Cyclotella stelligera complex, and a concurrent decline in the heavily-silicified Aulacoseira lirata complex, are similar to shifts that are increasingly being recognized as geographically widespread diatom responses to recent climate warming. The lake TK-2 diatom record provides important insights into the Holocene environmental history of this understudied region of the Canadian Arctic. Furthermore, it is one of the few Arctic lakes in which the 8.2 k cold event is possibly expressed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Our understanding of migratory birds' year-round ecology and evolution remains patchy despite recent fundamental advances. Periodic reviews focus future research and inform conservation and management; here, we take advantage of our combined experiences working on Western Hemisphere avian migration systems to highlight recent lessons and critical gaps in knowledge. Among topics discussed are: (1) The pipeline from pure to applied researchers leaves room for improvement. (2) Population limitation and regulation includes both seasonal and between-season interactions. (3) The study of movements of small-bodied species remains a major research frontier. (4) We must increase our understanding of population connectivity. (5) With few exceptions, population regulation has barely been investigated. (6) We have increasingly integrated landscape configuration of habitats, large-scale habitat disturbances, and habitat quality impacts into models of seasonal and overall demographic success. (7) The post-breeding season (late summer for latitudinal migrants) is increasingly appreciated for its impacts on demography. (8) We recognize the diverse ways that avian brood parasites, nest predators, and food availability affect demography. (9) Source-sink and meta-population models help us understand migratory avian distributions among fragmented habitats. (10) Advances in modeling have improved estimates of annual survival and fecundity, but for few species. (11) Populations can be limited by ecological conditions in winter, but habitat needs are poorly known for most species at this time. (12) Migration tends to occupy broad spatial fronts that may change seasonally or when migrants cross major barriers. (13) En route conditions can limit migrant populations; linking migration habitat quality indicators to fitness or population consequences presents a major challenge. (14) A variety of intra-tropical Neotropical migration patterns are recognizable,. but almost nothing is known about these systems beyond descriptions of a few typical species' movements. (15) Global climate change scenarios predict range and phenology shifts of Neotropical migrant bird populations that must be considered in conservation plans. Future studies will depend on new technologies and the integration of modeling with sophisticated, large-spatial-scale measurement and parameter estimation; whether the pace of research and management involving migratory birds can match the growth of environmental threats remains to be seen.

TI  - Technical indicators for evaluation of housing systems for cattle, pigs and laying hens relating to animal welfare
T2  - ZUCHTUNGSKUNDE
LA  - German
AB  - The animal production and welfare committee of the German Society for Animal Breeding compile technical environmental indicators. The purpose of these indicators provide the animal with good conditions in keeping with demands to protect the environment. To achieve this, compromises are often made. It is sometimes thought that these technical indicators can be based strongly on discrete data of easily measurable parameters This focus on certain characteristics of a production system leads to false assessments of animal welfare aspects in individual cases.
   For an assessment, the committee have produced a basic set of criteria comprising four assessment areas: supply of feed and water, waste handling, housing design and housing climate. In addition, these are differentiated according to animal species: cattle, pigs and laying hens. For cattle, for example, indicators include the design of the feeding area, the number of drinking units, the feeding technique and frequency of feeding. In pig production, similar criteria are considered. For example, in animal groups the protection of a feeding animal from other animals in the group is an important detail. For the waste management, the floor design, security of footing, and waste management technique are important subcriteria. This means that the floor should be dry, clean and provide secure footing. The floor should ensure that natural hoof wearing occurs, and that hoofs are protected from injury (in particular in the case of perforated floors). In the assessment of the house design, aspects group and individual keeping systems are considered. For example the organisation of the functional areas in relation to one another and the degree to which the functions are separated. For the three mentioned animal species, climatic criteria focus on conditions that affect the animals directly. This means that climate factors such as temperature, relative humidity, dust and pollution gases, light intensity and lighting period, UV-radiation and climate stimuli are important indicators.
   Preliminary outcomes include for example the conclusion that indicators based only on technical details can lead to criteria that are not directly related to the welfare of the animal. System independent objective criteria that relate directly to the welfare and health of the animal are needed. Where system details are included there is the danger that the development of new systems is hindered. Animal welfare can be improved using technical developments such as automatic animal recognition using implanted transponders. In the end, for technical indicators a multi-factorial approach is required. This means good compromises should be sought.

AB  - Heavy metal (Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) concentrations in surface sediment porewater and their benthic fluxes were investigated in Daya Bay, South China, to study their accumulation and transfer at the sediment-water interface, as well as the impact of human activities on heavy metals. Heavy metals in porewater displayed different patterns in three partitions (top, center and Inlet), which was mainly attributed to the difference in the biogeochemical conditions, hydrodynamic force inner the bay and the human activities along the bay. Ecological risk assessment results showed that heavy metals in porewater dramatically exceeded the background values. The average release of heavy metals from sediment were (6.1 +/- 3.3) x 10(4) -(2.7 +/- 1.6) x 10(8) g a(-1) in the bay, so they had potential risks to the water environment, and sediment should be paid more attention to as the endogenesis of contamination.

AB  - It has been shown that wood substrates are the main source of nitrogen for xylotrophic fungi, which have almost the same isotopic signature as their substrate. This fact and a strong positive correlation in nitrogen isotope composition between the substrates and fungi provide evidence for a closed type of nitrogen turnover in the wood-fungus system that is based on retention and repeated utilization of this element. Its isotope composition in the fungi depends on that in the substrate, which is enriched in the heavy isotope in deciduous wood and in the light isotope in coniferous wood. The nitrogen isotope composition in the fungi and wood substrates does not depend on the degree of wood mineralization or climatic conditions, and delta N-15 is not an indicator of fungal physiological activity or wood decomposition rate but rather a marker of the isotopic composition of nitrogen sources for the fungi.

AB  - This paper aims to provide guidance as to how better to assess sustainability in certification schemes, such as the Australian Forestry Standard, and to provide suggestions for related changes to certification guidelines.The meaning of sustainability in relation to forestry and the principles underpinning sustainability and the calculation of sustained yield are examined to see how best they can be assessed in certification schemes, given the complexities of temporal and spatial change. To be useful in certification, such principles need to be capable of translation into auditable features, be they qualitative or quantitative. They also need to recognise the realities of demand and supply movements, landscape change, natural disasters, technological change and risk management. Forestry Tasmania's sustainable yield planning provides a case study that illuminates some of these issues, including the associated process of risk management.The sustainability of jointly supplied environmental goods and services (e.g. wood and biodiversity) is more difficult to assess but also needs to be capable of auditoften involving, among other things, spatial assessment of conditions such as species diversity, fragmentation and connectedness and application of the precautionary principle.

AB  - Ecological assessments of sites containing hazardous wastes are improved by field testing. In situ exposures of Ceriodaphnia dubia were conducted in a stream impacted by several effluents, a combined sewer overflow and a creosote treatment operation. Sediments contained high levels of metals and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. Fish and macroinvertebrate community indices were depressed. Ceriodaphnia dubia were placed in sediment exposure chambers in the stream for 48 h and also exposed to sediments that were simultaneously collected in the laboratory. Percent survival was generally higher in situ as compared to static laboratory exposures; however, overlying water toxicity was lower in laboratory assays. Average survival rates in elutriate fractions were slightly higher than interstitial or solid-phase exposures, and filtration reduced both elutriate and interstitial fraction toxicity. In situ sediment exposures proved to be sensitive indicators of both degraded and nondegraded stream conditions. Results show traditional sample collection and laboratory toxicity test methods may alter the water and sediment toxicity that occurs in situ. This highlights the importance of laboratory validation and in situ testing in aquatic safety assessments.

AB  - The increasing demand for water for multiple uses in the watershed of the Sao Francisco Rivermakes the knowledge of the hydrological characteristics an important instrument so that the use of its resources are optimized with less environmental impact. The analysis of changes in the lower Sao Francisco River resulting from the successive introduction of dams along the passages and their environmental effects are extremely important when seeking the revival of this waterway. The objective of this study was to determine changes in flow regime in the periods before and after the construction of the Xingo reservoir on the Sao Francisco River and relate these changes with some ecological implications. For this, we used the method of hydrologic alteration indicators (IHA) and the method of the Environment Flow Components (EFCs). There was a reduction of -31%, -21% and -35% respectively for average, minimum and maximum flow when comparing the studied periods.

AB  - Estuaries provide significant cultural ecosystem services, including recreation and tourism. Disruptions of estuarine biogeochemical processes resulting from environmental degradation could interrupt the flow of these services, reducing benefits and diminishing the welfare of local communities. This study focused on recreational shellfishing in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts (41.55 degrees N, 70.80 degrees W). Relationships among measures of recreational shellfishing, estuarine water quality, and local socioeconomic conditions were tested to understand how the benefits of cultural ecosystem services to local communities might be affected by declining water quality. Transferring estimated economic benefits from an analysis of nearby municipalities, the study finds that increases in Chl a during the 24-year period were associated with losses in recreational shellfishing benefits of $0.08-0.67 million per decade. The approach presented here suggests a more broadly applicable framework for assessing the impacts of changes in coastal ecosystem water quality on the welfare of local communities.

AB  - Useful knowledge acquisition from known and systematized information (data) is a big challenge for researchers, users and finally, decision makers. In this sense, knowledge discovery from data (KDD) process represents a valuable tool for information analysis. Moreover, this work presents an approach through KDD in time series pattern identification for anchovy and sardine fisheries and environmental data, in northern Chile. Time series, multivariate analysis and data mining techniques, along with technical literature review for results validation. The KDD approach and the data mining techniques implemented achieved an integration between these variables, identifying relevant patterns associated with fisheries abundance fluctuations and strong association with environmental changes such as El Nino and long-term cold-warm regimes between them, establishing anchovy and sardine pre-dominant time-periods, associated with environmental conditions are identified. The latter establishes groundwork for studying underlying functional relationships that could reduce gaps in the national fisheries management policies for those fisheries.

AB  - Changes in cellulolytic activity of Asiatic clams (Corbicula fluminea) and snails (Mudalia dilatata) were monitored throughout 30-d exposures to constant additions (0.0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.50, and 1.0 mg l-1) of zinc (Zn). All exposures of 0.05 mg Zn l-1 or greater significantly reduced enzyme activity (exo- and endocellulase) in both molluscs as early as 10 d following exposures in outdoor laboratory streams incorporating New River water as diluent. More sterile laboratory stream exposures were less consistent in yielding quantifiable differences that could be attributed to metal induced stress apart from effects of nutritional stress. Tests conducted under natural field conditions during all seasons did not differ significantly with respect to changes in annual energetics of either clams or snails. However, evidence of differing uptake routes, with respect to two ecologically and physiologically distinct molluscs, was apparent in bioaccumulation, growth, and enzyme activity throughout exposure and following 60-d recovery.

AB  - Society is confronted with an increasing number of applications making use of wireless communication. We also notice an increasing awareness about potentially harmful effects of the related electromagnetic fields on living organisms. At present, it is not realistic to expect that wireless communication will decrease or disappear within the near future. That is why we currently are investigating the mechanisms behind these effects and the effectiveness of possible solutions. In order to be efficient and effective, we designed and validated a fast and easy test on ants - these insects being used as a biological model - for revealing the effect of wireless equipments like mobile phones, smartphones, digital enhanced cordless telephone (DECT) phones, WiFi routers and so on. This test includes quantification of ants' locomotion under natural conditions, then in the vicinity of such wireless equipments. Observations, numerical results and statistical results allow detecting any effect of a radiating source on these living organisms.

AB  - The Middle Iskar cascade is situated along the middle course of the Iskar River (Bulgaria) after the capital city Sofia and has three small hydroelectric power plants that were put into operation by the end of 2012. The aim of this study was to evaluate the self-purification potential of water in the reservoirs of these plants as an important and necessary condition for their ecological functioning. The assessment was made by hydrochemical parameters (dissolved suspended solids, insoluble suspended solids, total suspended solids, nitrites, nitrates, ammonium, phosphates, chemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen) and microbiological parameters (aerobic heterotrophic bacteria and bacteria growing in an Endo medium) and covered a period of three years (2010, 2011 and 2012). Standard methods were applied, mainly colorimetric and microbiological cultivation methods. The obtained results showed high levels of some of the tested indicators during 2012. In the section of the Middle Iskar cascade a high self-purification potential was observed in the reservoirs which maintain good water quality.

AB  - In view of the toxic properties of nanoparticles, the authorities require them to be specifically identified and labeled. This is in keeping with the spirit of the REACH legislation, which aims to protect consumers from products with inadequately documented risks for human health and the environment. However, the presence of natural nanoparticles in the environment must also be taken into account, together with the fact that, in any mixture of particles, the presence of a fraction of nanometer-sized particles cannot be ruled out, owing to the laws of statistical distribution. Moreover, while all toxic nanoparticles generate oxidative stress, their properties are not due solely to their size but also to their shape, surface texture and composition. Thus, nanoparticle toxicity should be considered specifically for each substance or group of substances, and the notion of intentional manufacture of nano-sized particles should be included in the impact assessment. The conditions of nanoparticle concentration/dilution and persistence, especially in water and sewage sludge, exemplified by silver and titanium oxide, suggest that nanoparticle behavior in the environment should be monitored.

AB  - Exotic species have been widely used in reforestation in arid areas in northern Africa, as they provide ecosystem services that native species may be unable to supply. But information on their effect on ecosystem function and composition is scarce. We have evaluated the effect of 20-year-old Acacia saligna (Labill.) H.L. Wendl. plantations on the soil surface conditions and vascular plant composition in central Tunisia. Landscape function analysis (LFA) indices of soil stability, infiltration, and nutrient recycling underneath A. saligna increased by 1%, 138%, and 148%, respectively, in comparison to bare areas. This species, however, did not affect indicators of soil surface functionality, the spatial pattern of resource sinks-sources, or vascular plant species composition at a plot scale. This was probably due to low A. saligna cover, and a limited degree of litter incorporation into the soil surface. Our results suggest that the potential for improving ecosystem function and fostering succession by using this species seems to be limited in this arid environment.

AB  - This paper analyzes both positive and negative environmental impacts associated with, U.P. Government Chittaurgarh irrigation project, situated in the outer Indian Himalayas. The construction of a dam and canals have had a serious impact on flora and fauna. Agricultural and grazing lands have been lost by utilization of 405 ha Himalayan forest-land upstream and 212 ha of cultivated land downstream of the project. Impacts expected after canal operation include: rise in watertable; waterlogging; increased salinity, due to clay dominated soils with low permeability, and high watertable (0.43 m) during post-monsoon period; fuelwood and fodder crises due to deforestation in the catchment area; weed infestation, crop pests; and human diseases, e.g. malaria, poliomyelitis, filariasis and goitre. The siltation will increase 20 times after one decade due to the poor vegetation cover in the catchment area. Positive impacts include: flood control, increase in agricultural production (mainly rice, 25 330 t yr-1) and improvement in socioeconomic conditions. Guidelines have been developed to eliminate negative impacts at an early stage, to ensure sustainable development, and to protect natural resources.

AB  - Quantitative assessments have long been used to evaluate the condition of the natural environment, providing information for standard setting, adaptive management, and monitoring. Similar approaches have been developed to measure environmental governance, however, the end result (e.g., numeric indicators) belies the subjective and normative judgments that are involved in evaluating governance. We demonstrate a framework that makes this information transparent, through an application of the Freshwater Health Index in three different river basins in Latin America. Water Governance is measured on a 0-100 scale, using data derived from perception-based surveys administered to stakeholders. Results suggest that water governance is a primary area of concern in all three places, with low overall scores (Guandu-26, Alto Mayo-38, Bogota-43). We conclude that this approach to measuring governance at the river basin scale provides valuable information to support monitoring and decision making, and we offer suggestions on how it can be improved.

AB  - This paper deals with the main physical and physiological determinants of human performance during a spaceflight and also addresses so far insufficiently discussed psychological context of being in this extreme environment. The greatest attention is paid to the issue of microgravity, radiation and circadian rhythms, with emphasis on the adaptive changes in physiological and psycho-physiological processes. The study explores the issue of data acquisition and the quality of information processing under the condition of isolation and confinement from natural stimuli and indicators. In this way, the paper further deals with the signals available to crew members about the changes in their cognitive, affective and motivational processes. The paper claims that besides the physiological and psycho-physiological adaptation to the space environment, psychological adaptation necessarily goes on at the same time. It is concluded that the in-depth qualitative investigation of the psychological adaptation could provide a more complete understanding of the accommodation of cognitive, affective and motivational processes during spaceflights.

AB  - Project monitoring is now a standard requirement in natural resource management programs, bringing opportunities for greater accountability, adaptive management and social learning. While considerable effort has gone into designing appropriate monitoring frameworks and indicators for OIL marine and coastal management, there has been less sharing of the mechanics of approaches that maximise collaboration and learning by multiple stakeholders. This paper outlines the project monitoring approach developed in the Pacific Islands International Waters Project (IWP), a project funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) involving; 14 Pacific Island Countries. We find that a monitoring approach based on indicators to assess supportive processes, behavioural change and human-environmental conditions is useful for monitoring the long- and short-term impacts associated with integrated coastal management programs. Giving project staff the lead in indicator development has supported more strategic project planning and improved the relevance and value of the indicators developed. However, successful implementation of monitoring programs calls for ongoing collaboration, technical support and capacity building amongst key stakeholders. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Over the last 125 years, river regulation has considerably changed the ecological conditions of the Austrian Danube and its floodplains such that the system is now very fragmented. Within the municipal area of Vienna, these changes have been particularly severe: river embankments and a bypass channel (the 'New Danube'), separated from the main river by an artificial island ('Danube Island'), are the key elements of flood control, and river levels are controlled by the Vienna hydroelectric power plant ('Freudenau'). During construction of the hydroelectric power plant, the previously straight shoreline of the 21-km long Danube island, with its steep embankments, was restructured by creating shallow water areas, gravel banks, small permanent backwaters and temporary waters. This paper describes the scheme and the results from the first year of a 4-year monitoring programme ('Danube Island Monitoring Programme', DIMP) investigating the colonization and successional processes of these areas by monitoring relevant indicator groups (vegetation, dragonflies, amphibians, reptiles, waterfowl).

AB  - El-Mex Bay and Nubaria are two huge coastal embayments located west of Alexandria, Egypt. The bay is a popular fishing spot as well as a recreational location. It is one of the most extensively polluted locations on the Egyptian Mediterranean coast, receiving a massive amount of agricultural, industrial, and sewage waste from the nearby Lake Mariut via the El-Umoum and Nubaria Drains. The current study evaluated the geographical variations of plankton and water quality in the western side of Alexandria, namely Nubaria and El-Mex sites, using multivariate statistical analysis for eight sites seasonally during 2018. The samples were examined extensively for species identification and abundance measurement. The water is very alkaline and well-oxygenated in the summer. The results showed that the annual average of phytoplankton in Naubaria site was 577 +/- 496 x 103 cells l(-1), while the annual average of zooplankton was 54.1 +/- 50.0 x 10(3) ind m(-3). A total of 122 and 91 phytoplankton species were quantified from El-Mex and Naubaria sites, respectively. However, 96 and 98 zooplankton species were identified in El-Mex and Naubaria site, respectively. The most differentiating factor between two sites and between various locations were salinity. The multiple correlations, redundancy analysis (RDA), regression analysis, and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were performed, and both indicated that the water temperature, salinity, and SiO4 were the main limiting factors for the abundance of most plankton communities. Also, some plankton groups acted as stimulants or inhibitors for the flourishing of other groups. The correlations between both phytoplankton and zooplankton in terms of abundance, temperature, and salinity were dismantled due to the evolution of plenty of euryhaline and eurythermal species adapting to these hard conditions. Also, water quality index (WQI) values indicate that the water of studied locations was heavily polluted. So, periodical monitoring for these areas, treatment of wastes before being discharged in marine water, and using new technologies for tracking pollutants are highly recommended. Monitoring programmes for phytoplankton and zooplankton ecology as a bioindicator for pollution were highly recommended in the study. In addition, this study suggests the usefulness of multivariate statistical methods in the analysis of water quality and recommendations for environmental recovery and restoration are proposed for preservation of El-Mex Bay and Naubaria sites in order to facilitate development of environmental and tourist activities.

AB  - A new sorption-based technique for sensing trace toxic metals (e.g., lead, copper, zinc) in water is described in the article. The methodology uses a novel, environmentally benign, inorganic hybrid sorbent material (HSM) and the pH is the sole surrogate parameter for the detection of toxic metals. HSM is a granular composite of calcium magnesium silicate (Ca2MgSi2O7), sparingly soluble, and maintains a near-constant alkaline pH in contact with water due to steady release of hydroxyl ions (OH-) caused by slow hydrolysis of HSM. When water containing common electrolytes (Na+, Ca2+, Cl-, SO42-) is passed through the HSM bed in a mini-column, the exiting pH consistently remains around 9.0. In contrast, in the presence of trace concentration of toxic metals (say lead or zinc) in water, there is a significant drop in pH (2 units) under otherwise identical conditions. The drop in pH and breakthrough of toxic metal at the column exit occur concurrently. Since the pH is the sole indicating parameter, the presence of commonly occurring buffering species is likely to interfere with the sensing process. While interference of bicarbonate is avoided through adjustment of the inlet pH, the effect of phosphate and natural organic matter (NOM) is overcome using a hybrid anion exchanger (HAIX) prior to HSM. In HAIX, hydrated ferric oxide nanoparticles, dispersed within the polymeric phase, selectively remove phosphate or other weak acid anionic ligands (e.g., fulvate in NOM). This technique validates the detection of lead and zinc in synthetic water, tap water, and river water. The use of HAIX in conjunction with HSM allows the selective removal of phosphate/NOM, while HSM offers selective binding of toxic metal at slightly alkaline pH (9.0) resulting from its unique dissolution behavior. Also, different toxic metals, such as Pb, Cu, and Zn, are apt to form labile metal-hydroxy complexes at this pH condition causing dissipation of OH- in the aqueous phase. In essence, all these phenomena synergistically work for interference-free sensing of toxic metals through pH change. Except the pH meter or the indicator solution, no other instrument or chemical is required. This technique has immense potential for field applications in both the developed and the developing world.

AB  - In this paper, the regional efficiency of healthcare facilities in Slovakia is measured (2008 - 2015) using a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The window DEA was chosen since it leads to increased differentiation of results, especially when applied to small samples, and it enables year-by-year comparisons of the results. Two inputs (number of beds, number of medical staff) and two outputs (use of beds, average nursing time) were chosen as variables in output-oriented 4-year window DEA model for the assessment of technical efficiency in 8 Slovak regions. As the regional efficiency is driven by natural, historical, macro-economic and political conditions, in the next stage the impact of environmental factors on efficiency is examined. The results have confirmed that the public costs, private costs, departments, higher education, population over 65, life expectancy, wage costs, population size and income inequality indicator s80/s20 are statistically significant and therefore affect the efficiency of healthcare facilities in Slovakia.

AB  - The aquaculture industry is developing at a fast pace, growing from 1 million tonnes a year harvested in the 1950s, to more than 75 million tonnes nowadays. However, there are rising concerns over the environment impacts. The aim of this study is to investigate the impacts of salmon aquaculture in Loch Creran, Scotland, using mussels Mytilus edulis (Linnaeus, 1758) as a bioindicator. Water samples and mussel tissues were collected from two different sites along the loch shore and were analysed for contaminant bioaccumulation and biological effects, using gas chromatography and histology techniques. The results showed high levels of heavy metals and organic compounds (n-hexadecanoic acid, 1-Heptatriacontanol, Iso-phorone, Cholestan-3-ol and oleic acid) in mussel tissues close to the salmon farms. The histology results indicate that the mussels from the aquaculture site are in poor health condition, with 90 % of tissue samples exhibiting one or more signs of pollutant induced stress, such as haemocyte infiltrations, lipofuscin accumulation, parasites and possible neoplasms.

AB  - This article reviews the impact of social participation on the results of projects aimed at the improvement and conditioning of fluvial spaces for public use. This work focuses on a partially materialised fluvial rehabilitation in Arevalo (Avila), a Spanish rural settlement. The hypothesis of the study was that the projects success depended not only on its technical aspects but also on the involvement of local population from its beginning and on the information and environmental education that they received. Once the first stage of the project was completed, and in order to measure the projects performance, some indicators related to the developed activities were collected and a survey was carried out. The results show that, thanks to a social feedback process, there was a rise of the fluvial space knowledge and consciousness of the environment among the population, as well as a reconciliation with the river area.

AB  - Effective ecosystem management requires a robust methodology to analyse, remedy and avoid ecosystem damage. Here we propose that the overall conceptual framework and approaches developed over millennia in medical science and practice to diagnose, cure and prevent disease can provide an excellent template. Key principles to adopt include combining well-established assessment methods with new analytical techniques and restricting both diagnosis and treatment to qualified personnel at various levels of specialization, in addition to striving for a better mechanistic understanding of ecosystem structure and functioning, as well as identifying the proximate and ultimate causes of ecosystem impairment. In addition to applying these principles, ecosystem management would much benefit from systematically embracing how medical doctors approach and interview patients, diagnose health condition, select treatments, take follow-up measures, and prevent illness. Here we translate the overall conceptual framework from medicine into environmental terms and illustrate with examples from rivers how the systematic adoption of the individual steps proven and tested in medical practice can improve ecosystem management.

AB  - Park managers realized more than 130 years ago that protected areas are often subsets of larger ecosystems and are vulnerable to change in the unprotected portions of the ecosystem. We illustrate the need to delineate protected area centered ecosystems (PACEs) by using comprehensive scientific methods to map and analyze land-use change within PACEs around 13 US national park units. The resulting PACEs were on average 6.7 times larger than the parks in upper watersheds and 44.6 times larger than those in middle watersheds. The sizes of these PACEs clearly emphasized the long-term reliance of park biodiversity on surrounding landscapes. PACEs in the eastern United States were dominated by private lands with high rates of land development, suggesting that they offer the greatest challenge for management. Delineating PACEs more broadly will facilitate monitoring, condition assessment, and conservation of the large number of protected areas worldwide that are being degraded by human activities in the areas that surround them.

AB  - The implementation of an ecological risk assessment framework is presented for dredged material deposits on soil close to a canal and groundwater, and tested with sediment samples from canals in northern France. This framework includes two steps: a simplified risk assessment based on contaminant concentrations and a detailed risk assessment based on toxicity bioassays and column leaching tests. The tested framework includes three related assumptions: (a) effects on plants (Lolium perenne L.), (b) effects on aquatic organisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Ceriodaphnia dubia, and Xenopus laevis) and (c) effects on groundwater contamination.
   Several exposure conditions were tested using standardised bioassays. According to the specific dredged material tested, the three assumptions were more or less discriminatory, soil and groundwater pollution being the most sensitive. Several aspects of the assessment procedure must now be improved, in particular assessment endpoint design for risks to ecosystems (e.g., integration of pollutant bioaccumulation), bioassay protocols and column leaching test design.

AB  - Efficient energy use by the agriculture sector is one of the conditions for sustainable agriculture because it allows financial savings, fossil resources preservation and air pollution decrease. We propose an Energy indicator (I-En) to evaluate environmental impacts due to energy consumption of arable farming systems to help farmers to manage their energy inputs at the field level according to the guidelines of integrated agriculture. I-En is based on the energetic analysis of four types of energy: two for indirect energy (pesticides and fertilisers) and two for direct energy (machinery and irrigation systems). In a second step, the assessed values of energy consumption are converted by means of an abacus into a mark between 0 and 10. I-En needs only data that are available on farms or easily assessed, and will be implemented with a set of seven other agro-ecological indicators to assess environmental sustainability of farms.

AB  - 1. The Mancha Humeda Biosphere Reserve includes approximately 50 lakes, most of them shallow and temporary (lagunas).
   2. Despite their international importance, numerous impacts affect them, including pollution in lagunas located near villages and the partial or total desiccation of most sites due to river channelization and groundwater over-exploitation.
   3. Restoration attempts over a period of years failed because they aimed to improve living conditions for only unrepresentative indicator taxa and neglected the temporal dynamics of aquatic systems.
   4. Key recommendations are discussed for restoration, based on functional analysis: i) Restoring and/or preserving the original hydroperiod (including drought) and the diversity of water input; ii) protecting the structure and function of sediments, considering nutrient availability to assess water quality; iii) categorizing the environments in terms of the dominant primary producers; iv) complementing estimates of production by considering its fate and Form of consumption; and v) identifying key events triggering the main patterns of ecosystem organization (either episodical or periodical, abiotic or biotic).

AB  - Results are presented on a study of the zooplankton of Butgenbach reservoir and from the Warche and Holzwarche rivers which feed the reservoir (March and October 1996). The zooplankton was dominated by rotifers in spring and by crustaceans (cladocerans and copepods) in summer and autumn. A temperature gradient developed during summer and a drastic depletion of oxygen and increase in ammonia concentrations was observed below 7 m depth. The water quality of the River Warche was compared upstream and downstream of the lake using bioindication by rotifers and by reproduction ecotoxicological tests on Brachionus calyciflorus on the other hand. The bioindicators reveal an overall improvement in water quality of the Warche downstream of the reservoir, whereas the toxicity assays show a decline in water quality downstream of the lake during the stratification period, due to the release of hypolimnetic water from the dam. So, under special conditions, ecotoxicity assays appear to be more sensitive than bioindication using rotifers saprobic valences.

AB  - In the present study we investigated long-term climate imprints (160 year period) on tree-ring delta N-15 signatures of sessile oak (Quercus petraea) at sites with contrasting water availability (i.e. Cambisols vs. Regosols in Luxembourg, Central Europe, with 175 mm and 42 mm available water capacity, respectively). We hypothesized that tree-ring delta N-15 signatures constitute a sensitive indicator to long-term shifts in climatic conditions. Our findings revealed a close positive correlation between winter and spring temperatures and tree-ring delta N-15 signatures. These relationships were stronger for Cambisol than for Regosol sites. If entire chronologies were considered, peaks in annual mean temperatures closely corresponded with peaks in tree-ring delta N-15 signatures, with both annual mean temperatures and delta N-15 signatures reaching their maxima within the last two decades. In addition, we found a weak but significant impact of February precipitation on delta N-15 signatures, but only for Cambisols. We hypothesize that these findings are attributable to climate- (particularly temperature-) mediated nitrification rates in forest soils. As nitrification is a strongly fractionating process that produces N-15-depleted nitrate and higher isotopic ratios for ammonium in the topsoil, increased nitrification leads to N-15-enriched pools of N-inorg in the upper soil horizons and therefore higher delta N-15 signatures in plant tissues. Weaker correlations at Regosol sites were likely related to dryer and more acidic site conditions, both of which may reduce nitrification rates. Comparisons of oak and beech trees in the study area point to species-specific trajectories of wood nitrogen isotopes, likely related to the partitioning of ammonium and nitrate among species. In conclusion, tree-ring delta N-15 signatures may serve as an integrator of terrestrial N cycling and as such constitute a valuable tool in the identification of spatial and temporal patterns of N cycling in relation to environmental changes. Due to the mediating effects of the isotopic composition of the respective N sources, analyses of the isotopic composition of airborne N loads would support the interpretation of wood delta N-15 patterns, particularly in areas that are subject to high N pollution.

AB  - The present study aims to assess the extent of trace metal pollution in the sediments of Sita-Swarna estuary, west coast of India, and investigate their possible ecological risk on the aquatic environment. The sediment cores were analyzed for sand, silt, clay, organic carbon, and trace metals (Al, Fe, Mn, As, Cd, Co, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cr, and Cu) at 2-cm intervals. The study revealed that sediments have deposited in relatively violent to very violent hydrodynamic energy conditions. Factor analysis indicated that the metal distribution is mainly controlled by Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides and organic carbon. Further, the geochemical approach, pollution indices, and statistical evaluation revealed moderate pollution in the catchment. From an ecotoxicological perspective, the estimated risk index (RI) value was found to less than 150, indicating low risk for aquatic life. Thus, this baseline study would help to adopt strategies in pollution control and protect the fragile marine environment.

AB  - We present for the first time, data on fish assemblage structure for ten temporarily closed estuaries (TCEs) along the south-western coast of India. Fish community structure differed significantly between TCEs based on species presence/absence, estuarine use and feeding mode. Marine migrant and freshwater stragglers dominated the 'fish guilds', while piscivores and zoobenthivores were the major feeding guilds, in all estuaries. We used the Estuarine Fish Community Index (EFCI) and a Combined Anthropogenic Pressure Index (CPI) to determine the ecological quality of TCEs. The application of functional guilds and EFCI successfully represented the use of TCEs by fish communities, and also the functional similarities existing between fish assemblages of these estuaries, despite considerable taxonomic, physical and chemical differences. EFCI indicated that the ecological health of TCEs in south-western India ranges from 'poor' to 'good'. We also established a significant relationship between CPI, EFCI and ecological quality in various TCEs using the Generalized Linear Model (GLM).

AB  - Demands on forest bioenergy feedstock are expected to increase in many countries due to climate change mitigation. However, sustainable use of forest biomass resources can be ensured only if local and landscape conditions are taken into account, linking energy use to its resource base. The aim of this study was to analyse the forest biomass potential for Lithuania's energy pathways, while comparing the projected demand of forest bioenergy feedstock with resource projections. This was performed using the Landscape simulation and Ecological Assessment (LEcA) tool and the energy model MESSAGE. Biomass demand can be met up to 2050, after which demands under a Biomass Low pathway can still be met by the domestic forest resource if other wood uses are reduced, while Biomass High leads to a biomass deficit regarding domestic forest resources. Information exchange between the energy model and the LEcA tool enables an integrated sustainability assessment, and may contribute to a sustainable and efficient use of forest as a bioenergy feedstock resource.

AB  - Seagrass is particularly susceptible to environmental degradation. The objective of the study is to develop an effective bioindicator to assess human-induced effects using morphological variation and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of seagrass. Samples were collected from eight islands situated at different distance from mainland with different human population density and therefore expected to experience different level of anthropogenic pressure. Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn, nitrate, and phosphate were measured. Metals were also measured in tissues of seagrass. Metal concentrations in sediment, water, and seagrass did not exceed the quality standards required for marine life. Heterogeneity of FA was found among sites suggesting that there are some factors changing developmental instability of seagrass which is not associated to particular toxicants. This baseline study indicates that the water condition is still natural and shows no signs of metal contamination, therefore it does not cause a detectable stress on morphological variation and FA of seagrass.

AB  - The objective of the study was to assess ecological preferences of diatoms in tropical river system, Sao Carlos-SP, Brazil. Benthic diatom communities, nutrients, ions, organic pollution, metal levels and other variables were assessed for sampling sites established along the river system. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to identify the environmental variables governing the diatom assemblages. Weighted averaging was used to estimate optima and tolerances of some diatom taxa for the most influential variables. Upstream sites with significantly low nutrients, ions, organic pollution and metal levels were dominated by species belonging to the genera Neidium,, Diadesmis, Eunotia, Aulacoseira, Stauroneis and Surirella, and the species Cymbopleura naviculiformis,Orthoseira dentroteres, and Thalassiosira weissflogii. Downstream sites with significantly high nutrients, ions, organic pollution and metal levels were dominated by such species as Nitzschia palea, Achnanthes lanceolata, Fallacia monoculata, Sellaphora pupula, Cyclotella meneghiniana and Luticola goeppertiana. Diatom community structure and dynamics were important indicators of ecological conditions in the tropical lotic system.

AB  - Morphological growth forms confer ecological adaptability to lichens species and are indicators of habitat conditions and various climatic as well as zooanthropogenic pressures. Lichens samples from six sites in two locations of Badrinath valley were studied in order to assess the influence of macro-scale environmental variables (i.e. altitude, relative humidity and temperature) on diversity and distribution of lichens, using ordination (PCA and hierarchical clustering) and correlation analysis. The study recorded 106 lichen species in the valley. Parmeliaceae was a dominant family. Lichen species constitution in sites resulted in different groups, which were determined by the dominant growth forms and substrate preferences. Lichen growth form distribution was significantly correlated with studied macro-scale environment variables. On rock (saxicolous) substrate was the main substrate of lichen inhabitancy in the valley. The study concluded that macro-scale environmental variables play determining role in lichen community constitution of alpine habitats in Himalayas.

AB  - Recent years have seen the emergence of Eco-innovation as the way of the future, in which regards the valuation of the growth potential in a volatile environment. First regarded as a response to negative externalities, then as normal elements in the industrial dynamics, eco-innovations are acknowledged as extremely significant in the constantly changing competitive conditions. This paper presents the concept of eco-innovation and its taxonomy, in order to set the bases for further research within a project aimed at providing the Romanian SMEs with the necessary tools for improving their eco-innovative capacity and making use of their natural potential. In the first stages of the project, the research being reflected in this paper, a theoretical overview of the macroeconomic and microeconomic elements of eco-innovation, alongside a series of models (both based on indicators The Shift Model, as well as mathematical modeling The Percolation Diffusion Model) are presented.

AB  - Research has long identified racial differences in perceptions of criminal injustice. Given that race is confounded with neighbourhood context, it remains unclear the extent to which individual or neighbourhood attributes explain racial differences in these perceptions. This paper advances research on racial differences in perceptions of unjust police practices in the US by relying on a survey of 3000 residents in 53 Cincinnati neighbourhoods. A propensity score weighting approach is used to identify a model by which Whites and Blacks living in similar neighbourhood environments can be compared with each other. The results demonstrate that race remains a significant predictor of perceptions of unjust police practices, even after taking into account the ecological structuring of neighbourhoods and their perceived environmental context. These findings suggest that racial consciousness with regard to perceived injustices by the police is not purely a condition of personal or structural disadvantage. The implications of these findings for police reform efforts to mend minority relations in urban cities are discussed.

AB  - Simple Summary Tail biting is a common problem within modern pig production and is mainly an indicator of poor housing environment where the behavioural needs of pigs are not met. Tail biting causes pain and can result in infection, leading to reduced pig growth and reduced farm profits. In order to prevent tail biting, pigs are often tail docked, without pain relief, within the first week of life. The EU Directive condemns routine tail docking and advises that tail biting can be prevented through improving the environment of pigs. In Sweden, tail docking is banned and all pigs are reared with intact tails. This paper summarises knowledge from Swedish production of undocked pigs and describes practical solutions in use in Sweden that can be applied to pig production in other EU Member States. Housing conditions and management within Swedish pig production, such as stocking density and feeding space, differ in many aspects from those in other EU countries. To prevent tail biting and eliminate the need for tail docking, EU legislation should more clearly match with the biological needs of pigs.
   Abstract Tail biting is a common issue within commercial pig production. It is mainly an indicator of inadequate housing environment and results in reduced health welfare and production. To reduce the impact of tail biting, pigs are commonly tail docked, without pain relief, within the first week of life. EU Council Directive 2008/120/EC prohibits routine tail docking, but the practice is still widely used in many Member States. Sweden has banned tail docking since 1988 and all pigs have intact tails, yet tail biting is a minor problem. This paper summarises and synthesises experimental findings and practical expertise in production of undocked pigs in Sweden and describes solutions to facilitate a transition to producing pigs with intact tails within intensive pig production in the EU. Swedish pig housing conditions and management differ in many aspects from those in other EU Member States. Swedish experiences show that lower stocking density, provision of sufficient feeding space, no fully slatted flooring, strict maximum levels for noxious gases and regular provision of litter material are crucial for success when rearing pigs with intact tails. To prevent tail biting and to eliminate the need for tail docking, we strongly recommend that EU legislation should more clearly match the biological needs of pigs, as is done in Swedish legislation.

AB  - Anoxic microsites can alter the habitat of upland soils and host diverse anaerobic processes that affect green-house gas production, nitrogen dynamics, and biodiversity. Microsites that are methanogenic indicate deeply reducing conditions that may have especially strong impacts on soil function. However, there have not been controlled studies to determine the regulators of methanogenic microsite formation or persistence and most studies have been limited to tropical or high organic matter soils. We hypothesized that upland methanogenesis, as an indicator of anaerobic activity, is primarily affected by soil moisture and organic matter. To test this hypothesis, we examined relationships between soil properties, rates of methanogenesis, and biogeochemical responses in an incubation experiment that manipulated soil source (semi-arid and mesic ecosystems), agricultural practice (conventional, no-till, and organic), and moisture (10%-95% water-filled porespace) of intact soil cores. Methanogenesis was correlated with factors related to both increased O-2 demand (e.g., soil respiration) and decreased O-2 diffusion (e.g., water-filled porespace), and the relative importance of these different mechanisms changed over four months. While the highest rates of methanogenesis occurred above 75% water-filled porespace, we observed methanogenesis over the full range of soil moistures. These are the driest soils shown to host methanogenesis, outside of biological soil crusts. Cores from plots with organic amendments had the highest rates of methanogenesis. Comparisons of methanogenesis and N-cycling revealed new relationships in upland soils: stronger methanogenesis was associated with more soil NH4+ and higher N2O emissions but less NO3-, likely due to reduced conditions causing increased denitrification and/or decreased nitrification. Our findings show that upland methanogenesis can arise from either increased O-2 demand or decreased O-2 diffusion, similar to wetland ecosystems, and that the presence of anoxic microsites appears to alter N-cycling. The current paradigm is that upland anaerobicity is generally a minor or moisture-related event, but we demonstrate here that it can be persistent, occur across the full range of soil moisture, and may result in significant impacts on nutrient availability. These and other anaerobic impacts on soil function and biodiversity may occur over the entire landscape of temperate ecosystems.

AB  - As the world experiences rapid urban expansion, natural landscapes are being transformed into cities at an alarming rate. Consequently, urbanization is identified as one of the biggest environmental challenges of our time, yet we lack a clear understanding of how urbanization affects free-living organisms. Urbanization leads to habitat fragmentation and increased impervious surfaces affecting for example availability and quality of food. Urbanization is also associated with increased pollution levels that can affect organisms directly, via ecophysiological constraints and indirectly by disrupting trophic interactions in multispecies networks. Birds are highly mobile, while an individual is not necessarily exposed to urban stressors around the clock, but nestlings of altricial birds are. Such a city-dwelling species with a long nestling phase is the Eurasian kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) in Vienna, Austria, which forage on a diverse diet differing in composition from rural habitats. Furthermore, prey items vary in nutritional value and contents of micronutrients like carotenoids, which might impact the nestlings' health. Carotenoids are pigments that are incorporated into integument tissues but also have antioxidant and immunostimulatory capacity, resulting in a trade-off between these functions. In nestlings these pigments function in parent-offspring communication or sibling competition by advertising an individual's physical or physiological condition. Anthropogenic disturbance and pollutants could have disruptive effects on the coloration of these traits. In this study, we measured carotenoid based coloration and other indicators of individual health (body condition and susceptibility to the ectoparasite Carnus hemapterus) of 154 nestling kestrels (n = 91 nests) along an urban gradient from 2010 to 2015. We found skin yellowness of nestlings from nest-sites in the city-center to be least pronounced. This result might indicate that inner-city nestlings are strongly affected by urban stressors and depleted their stores of dietary carotenoids for health-related functions rather than coloration. In addition, skin yellowness intensified with age and was stronger pronounced in earlier nests. Since the immune system of nestlings is still developing, younger chicks might need more antioxidants to combat environmental stress. Additionally, parasite infection intensity was highest in nestlings with less intense skin yellowness (paler or less yellow pigmented integuments) and in earlier nests of the season. In combination with results from previous studies, our findings provide further support for the low quality of the inner-city habitat, both in terms of productivity and individual health.

AB  - The consistent appropriate selection of environment-stable varieties, the range of plant without ear up to maximal ripeness ratio of grain to residual plant are the cardinal question in maize cultivation respecting the ripeness, growing and environmental conditions.
   By permanent control of the ripening process in the pre-harvest period up to ripeness maximum possible ratio of grain to rest plant (real time of harvest) and its detection by the Silage maize Ripeness Index (SRI) as phenological performance, selection and stress indicator the environmental performance potential of all varieties can be exploited, in all years, as well as each location and in all directions of use.
   The plant without ear as a concrete expression of the reduction of biomass production caused by drought stress and the careless cultivation of unstable varieties provide the base inevitably for drastic, estimated losses with regard to quality, yield, as well as extensive risks in environmental, consumer and animal welfare.
   Ripe different maize with green, vital and active photosynthesis residual plant with 22 % dry matter is in the field of physiological ripeness of grain by 63 % up to the agro-eco-efficient ripeness point and the interface of all use directions.
   Silage and energy maize with the SRI of 2.8 and still green residual plant should be continued in the interest of the effectiveness of the high-performance feeding up to the maximum possible ripeness ratio.
   The establishment of the plant architecture in the form of high maize high of about 225 cm is better for improve the yield potential compared to compact. Such differences were indifferent and not pronounced at the quality indicators.
   By phenotyping of the production levels in maize, also the risks of all kinds are estimated preventable in addition to the appraisal of quality and yield. In addition an assessment of ripeness, growing and environmental conditions of the crop year can be on the other hand same range based on the SRI retroactively.
   Interfaces, as the agro-eco-efficient ripeness point, for the coupling of other crop models, a selection index for breeding objectives of all use directions (performance, resistance and food value) as an environmental variable and standard for trial basis have been created with this Dynamic Ripeness and Analysissystem (DRA). The efficiency of the entire production branch is also ecologically to justify itself according to maximize success in each direction of use maize.

AB  - Riverine floods cause increasingly severe damages to human settlements and infrastructure. Ecosystems have a natural capacity to decrease both severity and frequency of floods. Natural flood regulation processes along freshwaters can be attributed to two different mechanisms: flood prevention that takes place in the whole catchment and flood mitigation once the water has accumulated in the stream. These flood regulating mechanisms are not consistently recognized in major ecosystem service (ES) classifications. For a balanced landscape management, it is important to assess the ES flood regulation so that it can account for the different processes at the relevant sites. We reviewed literature, classified them according to these mechanisms, and analysed the influencing ecosystem characteristics. For prevention, vegetation biomass and forest extent were predominant, while for mitigation, the available space for water was decisive. We add some aspects on assessing flood regulation as ES, and suggest also to include flood hazard into calculations.

AB  - This paper aimed to investigate the level of Tehran province sustainability in terms of environmental sustainability, current condition, and identifying effective environmental sustainability indicators within the province levels. The methods used in this research are descriptive-analytical for an effective assessment of non-quantifying issues. After that, the level of each province obtained through normalization of standard data in Excel software. Shanon Entropy evaluated the weight of each province and analyzed data in Arc GIS software mixed with Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) model gave a clear understanding of spatial characteristics of each indicator and singlesample T-test used for spatial illustration of the IDW model on environmental sustainability. The results obtained from this research show that Tehran province is at the lowest level of sustainability among other provinces. The environmental sustainability in Tehran province with a mean of 157 is less than 165 standard deviation, and therefore the indicators of exploitation of varied natural sources of energy and water resources were known as the most important indicators.

AB  - The rubber tree [Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. ex Adr. Of Juss.) Muell. Arg.] can be affected by the occurrence of the fungus Oidium heveae, which causes one of the most important diseases of rubber trees, powdery mildew. This work meet changes in photosynthetic pigments, an indicator of oxidative stress, in seedlings of three Hevea brasiliensis clones, RRIM 600, GT1 and PR255, under infection in Oidium heveae. The experiment was conducted in an open environment under natural photoperiod conditions and at the beginning of the trial, the rubber plants that would be inoculated were sprayed with an aqueous suspension containing Oidium heveae at a concentration of 16 x 104 conidia mL(-1). On the day of inoculation and after 48, 96, 144 and 192 h leaf samples were collected for the determination of photosynthetic pigments. Degradation in photosynthetic pigments in the period of infection was observed in rubber tree clones studied; thus, there is oxidative stress in clones of rubber trees. No promising genetic material for genetic improvement work stress tolerance by Oidium heveae was identified.

AB  - The area occupied by vegetated patches in comparison with area of the inter-patch, is becoming an accepted and useful standard against which to assess ecosystem function in arid and semi-arid environments. Proportional areas of vegetated patches were found to be positively correlated with oxidizable C and total N in surface soil in low-woodland, but not in low-shrubland communities. Suggested indices of soil-surface condition and derived ratings of landscape function were positively related to soil fertility but less clearly with proportional areas of vegetated patches. These relationships were community-type specific. It is unclear whether the suggested approach provides more information on landscape function than simple measures of patch heterogeneity.
   Patch-structure of low-woodland, compared to low-shrubland communities, may be more resistant to disturbance, however once disturbed, tow-woodland is less resilient in that nutrient losses are likely to be greater. (C) 2002 Academic Press.

AB  - Cephalopods, including octopuses, squids, and cuttlefishes, are exploited by both bottom trawl and small-scale fisheries (SSF) in most of the Mediterranean areas. Bottom trawl fisheries regard cephalopods as a valuable bycatch, whereas for SSF, they are among the main target species. Cephalopods account for a relatively small proportion of the total landings in the Mediterranean. However, from an economic point of view, four cephalopods, Eledone cirrhosa, Eledone moschata, Octopus vulgaris, and Sepia officinalis, account for approximately 15% of the total landing value. Despite their economic importance, there are very few stock assessments of cephalopods in the Mediterranean because it is difficult to assess them by classical age-based methods, given their short life-cycles, and highly variable growth and recruitment. The production of E. cirrhosa, E. moschata, Illex coindettii, Loligo vulgaris, O. vulgaris, S. officinalis, and Todaropsis eblanae in the waters off the south of Sicily accounts for approximately 8% of the total Mediterranean yield of cephalopods. This study presents the first attempt to assess the state of these cephalopods in the Strait of Sicily by using surplus production models. Since species-wise landing statistics may be unreliable because of their morphological similarity, some octopuses (E. cirrhosa and E. moschata) and ommastrephid squids (I. coindetii and T. eblanae) were assessed combined. Landing data and abundance indices from trawl surveys were used to describe cephalopod stock dynamics through the Bayesian State Space Schaefer model (BSM) and Surplus Production model in Continuous Time (SPiCT) models. As survey data were not considered reliable indicators of their abundance, O. vulgaris, S. officinalis, and L. vulgaris stocks were assessed using the Catch-Maximum Sustainable Yield (CMSY) model. Overall, squid and cuttlefish stocks were observed to be in healthy conditions. However, assessments of octopus stocks indicated that their condition was critical or recovering. Here, we discuss the different stock statuses in the light of evolving fisheries and environmental factors in the area over time. Although cephalopods are not a priority in the current management system of Mediterranean fisheries, the importance of these species in the food web and their relevance for SSF underline their importance and their exploitation status should be periodically evaluated.

AB  - Despite increasing calls for knowledge integration around the world, traditional knowledge is rarely used in formal, Western-science-based monitoring and resource management. To better understand indicators herders use and their relationship to researcher-measured indicators, we conducted in-depth field interviews with 26 herders in three ecological zones of Mongolia. We asked each herder to (1) assess the overall condition of three different sites located along a livestock-use gradient from their winter camp using a numeric scale, (2) describe the indicators they used in their assessment, and (3) explain what caused their pastures to remain healthy or become degraded. At each site, we collected field data on vegetation variables and compared these with herders' ratings and indicators using linear regression. We used classification and ordination to understand how herders' assessment scores related to plant community composition, and determine how well multivariate analysis of factors determining plant community composition aligned with herders' observations of factors causing rangeland change. Across all ecological zones, herders use indicators similar to those used in formal monitoring. Herders' assessment scores correlated significantly and positively with measured total foliar cover in all three ecological zones, and with additional measured variables in the steppe and desert steppe. Ordination revealed that herder assessment scores were correlated with the primary ordination axis in each zone, and the main factors driving plant community composition in each zone were the same as those identified by herders as the primary causes of rangeland change in that zone. These results show promise for developing integrated indicators and monitoring protocols and highlight the importance of developing a common language of monitoring terminology shared by herders, government monitoring agencies, and researchers. We propose a new model for integrating herder knowledge and participation into formal monitoring in Mongolia, with implications for rangelands and pastoral people globally. We suggest practical ways of involving herders in formal monitoring that have potential broad application for promoting local and indigenous people's participation in implementing international agreements such as the UN Convention to Combat Desertification and the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, both of which call for involvement of local people and indigenous/traditional knowledges.

AB  - The agricultural activity in the Argentine Pampas, characterized by an important trend towards no-till soybean monocropping, has completely transformed the original Pampas landscape into a monotonous scenario with a continuous succession of farms of very low crop diversity. This process has led to soil physical, chemical and biological degradation in those systems. The increase of crop rotation rates in no-till and reduced tillage systems has been proposed as an alternative with reduced negative impact on soils in the context of conventional agriculture. On the other hand, extensive organic farming is also suggested as an alternative to high-input agriculture systems. In this article, we aim to explore how different variations of fanning practices and systems impact soil macrofauna, along an edaphoclimatic gradient in the Pampas region. We studied the following systems: natural grassland (Gr) as indicator of the original community, extensive organic farming (Org), conventional agriculture with no-tillage and three crop rotation levels (Nt-R1, Nt-R2 and Nt-R3), and reduced tillage with two levels of crop rotation (Til and Til-R). We assessed soil macrofauna, with emphasis on earthworm, beetle and ant communities; and soil physical and chemical properties. Macrofaunal taxa composition was significantly affected by both management systems and edaphoclimatic conditions. The Gr community had pronounced differences from all the agricultural systems. The earthworm community from Gr had distinctive features from those of most agricultural systems, with Org and Nt-R3 being the most similar to Gr in native and exotic earthworm species, respectively. The beetle community in Org was the most different one, and the communities from the other systems did not show a pattern related to management. Ant community composition was not determined by management systems, but it was affected by edaphoclimatic conditions. All the studied macrofauna groups had a significant co-variation with soil physical and chemical properties, showing that both the characteristics of each soil relative to the geographic location and the effect of management on abiotic soil attributes have an important effect on soil macrofauna. This study confirms that biodiversity is being lost in Pampas soils, which implies a possible threat to the soil capacity to perform the processes that sustain soil functioning and hence plant productivity. Further considerations about the sustainability of the current agricultural model applied in the Argentine Pampas are needed.

AB  - Environmental assessment of municipal solid waste management is essential. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a powerful and widely used method, which implements causal chains (impact pathways) between the studied processes and their environmental impacts. However, in waste management, the method presents some weaknesses. For example, there is no impact category related to odour, whose assessment is nevertheless essential, especially when the organic fraction of waste is concerned. Odour interferes with human welfare and comfort. Sometimes, it can become a nuisance and be described as a "socio-environmental'' impact. To integrate the impact of odour in waste management plans, it is necessary to build an odour-impact pathway. The aim of this paper is to present a first attempt to build such an impact pathway up to the so-called midpoint step (i.e. the level of discomfort to human beings). The methodology we developed is based on the cause/effect chain according to the descriptors of the Site Dependent approach. Unlike classical LCA, the classification step is more important and characterization is aimed at computing the characterization factor. The change in this classification step allows for working on the occurrence of odour impacts. To determine impact occurrence, it is necessary to integrate local conditions into odour assessment. This was done using (1) the USEtox model in which local conditions to assess odour impacts are integrated and (2) the framework of a new methodology that takes into account background concentrations. The methodology was implemented in a case study, i.e. by computing atmospheric emission of ethyl benzene during composting (2.93 x 10(-2) kg.day(-1)). The characterization factor for ethyl benzene was equal to 3.02 x 10(-3) kg eq. Benzene per kg emitted ethyl benzene. The daily emission of ethyl benzene generated an odour impact equal to 6.6 x 10(-5) kg eq. benzene. With that first odour mid-point impact, we paved the way for the construction of a whole odour pathway (going up to end-point impacts or damages). However, several limits were identified such as data availability, the model under use and the use of average daily data which is less relevant than emission peaks. We should also recall that our methodology is not intended for predicting nuisance likely to disturb populations living nearby the facility. Its first objective is to provide an indicator that fits with LCA methodology in order to help local decision-makers to differentiate waste management scenarios based on exhaustive LCA.

AB  - Riparian vegetation in the lower reaches of Heihe River serves important ecological functions. However, the riparian ecosystems have been constantly deteriorating in the past 30 years simply due to water interception for oasis agricultural irrigation in the middle reaches of the river. This study pays a particular attention to Populus euphratica Oliv. forest because it is a dominant component of the riparian ecosystem in the lower reaches of Heihe River where the depth of groundwater table is the controlling factor in sustaining riparian ecosystems. To reveal leaf-related physiological responses of Populus euphratica Oliv, forest to groundwater table variations, we analyzed the relationships between the depth of groundwater table (DG) and three leaf-related parameters, i.e. leaf stomata! density (SD), specific leaf area (SLA), and stable carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13). Our results show that the relationship between DG and leaf SD is a bi-mode one shaped by both salt stress and water stress. That is, salt stress appeared in shallow groundwater conditions and water stress happened in deep groundwater conditions, and the thin layer around 2.7 m of DG is a stress-free layer. Leaf SD fluctuated according to the DG variation, first decreased with increasing DG, then increased at depths ranging 2.7-3.7 m, and after a relatively stable plateau of SD at depths ranging 3.7-5.2 m, decreased again with increasing DG. Our results also show that SLA decreased exponentially with increasing DG and foliar delta C-13 values are also strongly dependent on DG, further demonstrating that these two parameters are sensitive indicators of water stress. The exponential curve suggests that SLA is more sensitive to DG when groundwater table is shallow and 3 m seems to be a threshold beyond which SLA becomes less sensitive to DG. Foliar delta C-13 becomes more sensitive when the groundwater table is deep and 7 m seems to be a threshold below which the delta C-13 signature becomes more sensitive to DG. These findings should be helpful in monitoring the growth and development of Populus euphratica Oliv. forests and also in providing protection measures (i.e. DG related) for Heihe River riparian forests.

AB  - Transport of bacteria through natural porous media is an issue of increasing concern arising in several very important environmental processes. These include the percolation of bacteria from fecal waste to drinking water reservoirs, thus leading to a risk for human health, or the bioremediation of contaminated soils in which the bacteria are expected to travel long distances underground in order to reach contaminated areas and degrade chemicals originating from accidental spills. An understanding of bacterial retention and transport mechanisms in porous media would be of great help in the development of models able to predict the distance covered by bacterial suspensions in these situations.
   Experiments were carried out preparing columns filled of soil and sand, introducing bacteria culture (Escherichia coli, Pseudomona putida, and Listeria innocua) solutions by the top of the column. Breakthrough curves were obtained to see the transport of the bacteria in the column.
   The transport of different bacteria in the two soils aimed at establishing the relative importance of straining in different conditions. This has enabled us to obtain certain parameters, such as the sticking coefficients derived from the filtration theory or bacterial recoveries after multi-step elution, which aid our understanding of how bacteria are retained by mechanisms different to those usually included in the physico-chemical filtration theory.
   Several indicators may be used to determine the degree of relevance of straining as a mechanism acting during bacterial transport through porous media. Usually, in natural media, neither straining nor physico-chemical filtration is the sole mechanism contributing to bacterial retention. The retention of bacteria by straining mechanisms can be assessed by means of elution profiles under varying conditions. The inversion of flow in our experiments gave rise to secondary elution peaks, probably originating from bacteria retained in narrow pores
   According to experimental observations, straining was shown to contribute highly to bacterial retention in all the soils tested, in particular in the soils with a broader grain size distribution and more irregular shape. In both media, an increase in ionic strength did not lead to significant differences in bacterial retention, possibly due to the lack of relevance of ionic repulsion as a barrier to physico-chemical attachment of particles
   The study of bacteria transport in natural soil is an important step in the development of decontamination processes. The importance of the straining in the transport process has been revealed in the work carried out in this paper.

AB  - Tree ring and growth form sequences of 319 black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] BSP.) stems buried in a treeless peatland at the arctic tree line of northern Quebec were used to reconstruct the development of a woodland in response to climate change and fires during the last 2500 years. A high frequency of diagnostic tree rings (light rings and narrow rings) allowed the cross-dating of 142 individuals and the construction of a master chronology spanning AD 690-1591. Three floating chronologies covering 964 (approximate to 178 BC-AD 785), 349 (approximate to 587-239 BC) and 210 (approximate to 1274-1065 BC) years were also developed. The buried stems were classified as arborescent (75%), small fragments of unknown origin (13%), stumps (11%), and portions of stunted stems (1%). The high frequency of arborescent individuals indicates that the buried spruces were the remains of a former forest. The forest bordered the peatland between 600 BC and AD 1568, and successfully regenerated after two fires around 350 BC and 10 BC. Winter-damaged trees dominated during periods of suppressed growth at AD 760-860 and AD 1025-1400, whereas undamaged trees were more frequent during periods of rapid growth around AD 700-750, 860-1000, 1400-1450, and 1500-1570. Fast growth between AD 860-1000, along with the concurrent establishment of symmetrical trees, suggests well-defined boundaries for the Medieval Warm Period in northeastern Canada. The forest abruptly shifted to an open krummholz (stunted spruce) after the last fire in AD 1568, indicating that a climatic threshold inhibiting postfire regeneration was crossed between the second and the last fires. The maintenance of this old growth forest over 1500 yr, in the absence of external disturbances except climate change, was probably due to the buffering effect of aggregated trees on wind-drifted conditions at the snowpack line. With the exclusion of the forest influence on microclimate and local growth conditions, the AD 1568 fire caused the forest vegetation to shift to krummholz. The amplitude of these ecosystem changes at tree line does not mirror that of climate change. Hence, it is concluded that climate and vegetation reconstructions from proxy indicators cannot portray full ecological impact, because vegetation change at tree line is nonlinear relative to climate change.

AB  - Purpose Gold extraction in the Amazonian rainforest is accompanied by ecological threats and social grievances, but at the same time, the artisanal small-scale gold mining sector (ASGM) provides a livelihood for many people. To address this tradeoff, this paper analyzed the social aspects and their possible relations by conducting a case study based on a Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA). This study seeks to determine whether SLCA is capable of reflecting the sector. Method A literature-based guideline was used for collecting primary data during several field trips to the Tapajos Region in Brazil. This research instrument constituted the basis for information-oriented interviews and on-site observations. The SLCA categories used in this study were based on the United Nations Environment Programme and the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (UNEP/SETAC) guidelines and the categories in the Fairmined Standard. In addition, secondary data obtained from the literature were used to provide insights into the sector. The data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis with both deductive and inductive approaches. Results and discussion This study described the social aspects of the ASGM sector in the Tapajos Region, including the absence of the state, the illegality and informality of mining operations, the remote and rural area, and the organizational structure. In addition, the extraction methods, poor working conditions, and difficult living conditions were considered. Certain characteristics of the industry like unstable payments, worker movements, and low education levels were recognized, and thus, the relations among the social categories and rebound effects were identified. Several issues were proven to be key factors: unstable payments, autonomy, and the rebound effects of excavators. Complex relations among social issues but also towards ecological and economic issues do exist. The suitability of using the SLCA to reflect the ASGM sector was tested on this basis. Conclusion In some respects, the SLCA had limitations, e.g., due to the nonlinear relation between working hours and the amount of extracted gold. The impacts of technology depend on the underlying definition that is used. The current lack of cause-effect models impedes the assessment of an overall picture that considers the relations among the social aspects and other elements of sustainability. A holistic view must be applied if ecological problems are to be solved.

AB  - The unprecedented global biodiversity loss has massive implications for the capacity of ecosystems to maintain functions critical to human well-being, urgently calling for rapid, scalable, and reproducible strategies for biodiversity monitoring, particularly in threatened ecosystems with difficult field access such as wetlands. Remote sensing indicators of spectral variability and greenness may predict the diversity of plant communities based on their optical diversity; however, most evidence is based on narrowband spectral data or terrestrial ecosystems. We investigate how spectral greenness and heterogeneity from publicly available broadband multi-spectral Landsat satellite imagery explain variation in vegetation diversity across different wetland types, ecoregions, and disturbance levels using 1,138 sites surveyed by U.S. EPA's National Wetland Condition Assessment. We found positive correlations of plant species richness and diversity with indicators of annual maximum spectral greenness and its spatial heterogeneity, explaining up to 43% variation within the global sample, 48% within wetland types or ecoregions, and up to 61% with abiotic covariates. The combined effect of spectral greenness and heterogeneity was stronger than the best-performing model using climatic, topographic, and edaphic factors alone. When compared among major U.S. watersheds and individual states, the fit of diversity-greenness models increased when more wetland types were included within the corresponding region's boundaries, up to 61% at the watershed and 77% at the state level, respectively, for diversity models and up to 73% and 80%, respectively, for richness models. Model outliers were characterized by a significantly greater diversity of nonnative species (P < 0.0001), suggesting that changes in model performance and greenness distributions could be used as indicators of shifts in plant community composition, particularly in tidal wetlands making the majority of outliers with significantly lower than predicted diversity. This study represents a first-time national-scale effort to use publicly available remote sensing, climatic, and topographic data to predict plant diversity in wetlands, which tend to be understudied compared to terrestrial ecosystems despite being among the most stressed ecosystems on Earth. Our study suggests that multi-temporal broadband satellite imagery could provide a low-cost assessment of regional and national wetland biodiversity for prioritization of conservation efforts and early detection of biodiversity loss.

AB  - In marine sediments of late Cenozoic age, Spiniferites is a very common genus of dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts). Despite some taxonomical ambiguities due to large range of morphological variations within given species and convergent morphologies between different species, the establishment of an operational taxonomy permitted to develop a standardized modern database of dinocysts for the mid-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. In the database that includes 1490 surface sediment samples, Spiniferites mirabilis-hyperacanthus, Spiniferites ramosus and Spiniferites elongatus were counted in addition to Spiniferites belerius, Spiniferites bentorii, Spiniferites bulloideus, Spiniferites delicatus, Spiniferites lazus and Spiniferites membranaceus. Among these taxa, Spiniferites mirabilis-hyperacanthus, Spiniferites ramosus, and Spiniferites elongatus are easy to identify and are particularly common. Spiniferites bentorii and Spiniferites delicatus also are morphologically distinct and occur in relatively high percentages in many samples. Spiniferites lazus and Spiniferites membranaceus also bear distinctive features, but occur only in a few samples. The identification of other taxa (Spiniferites belerius, Spiniferites bulloideus, notably) may be equivocal and their reported distribution has to be used with caution. The spatial distribution of Spiniferites species, with emphasis on the five most common taxa, is documented here with reference to hydrography (salinity and temperature in winter and summer, sea ice cover), primary productivity and geographical setting (bathymetry, distance to the coastline). The results demonstrate distinct ecological affinities for Spiniferites elongatus, which has an Arctic-subarctic distribution and appears abundant in low productivity environments characterized by winter sea ice and large temperature contrast between winter and summer. Spiniferites mirabilis-hyperacanthus, which occurs in warm temperate water sites, is more abundant in high salinity environments. It shares its environmental domain with Spiniferites bentorii, which appears to have a narrower distribution towards the warm and high salinity end of the Spiniferites mirabilis-hyperacanthus distribution. In contrast, Spiniferites delicatus, which occurs in warm-temperate to tropical environments, shows preference for relatively low salinity and low seasonal contrasts of temperature. Spiniferites ramosus exhibits a particularly wide distribution that overlaps both cold and warm Spiniferites taxa. Its cosmopolitan occurrence and its long-ranging biostratigraphical distribution suggest a high plasticity of the species and/or co-occurrence of several cryptic species. Hence, whereas Spiniferites elongatus and Spiniferites mirabilis-hyperacanthus are useful palaeoecological indicators despite their large morphological variability, Spiniferites ramosus is a taxon with an unconstrained ecological significance.

AB  - To meet targets imposed by the European Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) it is vital that measures to improve the status of rivers are both effective and economically viable. Achievement of such aims needs robust understanding of biological responses to changes in water quality vis-a-vis mechanisms of and constraints to the colonization of previously polluted sites. This study therefore examined the long-term chemical and biological changes in historically polluted rivers to elucidate the responses of macroinvertebrate biota to improvements in chemical water quality. For three historically polluted sites in the English Midlands, data from surveys over a period of ca. 50 years were analysed. Ammonia (NH3) and 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) were used as chemical water quality indicators. Variations in the ecological recovery of the study sites were assessed using an average pollution sensitivity score (Average Score Per Taxon) and the number of taxa present (usually to family level) present in hand-net samples. Ecological recovery varied widely and was influenced by the intensity and spatial extent of the pollution and the proximity of available sources of potential colonisers. At the site most isolated from potential sources of colonizing taxa, no clean-water macroinvertebrate taxa were recorded 30 years after the major sources of pollution ceased. Where clean-water colonisers were more readily available, significant improvements in ecological quality followed within 2-5 years of the improvements in chemical quality. Macroinvertebrate communities and hence monitoring data may thus be indicative of long past conditions or of biological isolation rather than contemporaneous chemical conditions. Combined chemical and biological data were used to explore a generic model for predicting recovery rates and success. Neither BOD5 nor NH3 were found to provide a consistent and meaningful prediction of either average pollution tolerance of macroinvertebrate taxa or of the number of taxa present. Long-term relationships between macroinvertebrate variables and chemical water quality variables, however, were non-linear, Suggesting that water quality thresholds may have to be exceeded before biological recovery can Occur. Even when chemical water quality has been improved substantially, the apparent ecological status of macroinvertebrate communities may not reflect reduced pollution levels attained until adequate time to allow for re-colonisation (possibly decades) has elapsed.

AB  - Compilation of spore-pollen, diatom and biochemical analyses of samples from the top 80-cm sediments of Manzherok Lake, located on the western foothills of the Altai Mountains (51 degrees 49'15.5 '' N, 85 degrees 48035.7 '' E, 400 m a.s.l.), revealed influence of regional climate changes during the past 1350 years on the hydrological budget of the lake and the dynamics of the surrounding vegetation. Based on indicator species of diatom complexes in the lake sediments, the reconstructed lake level and pH can be deciphered as (1) shallow pond with relatively high pH prior to the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), (2) dramatic flooding with freshwater in the MWP, (3) lowering of the lake level during the Little Ice Age (LIA), and (4) contemporary rise of the lake level after the LIA. Increased concentrations of the detrital elements and severe degradation of diatom assemblages in the lake sediments took place during the dramatic flooding stage. The reconstructed lake level based on the diatom assemblages is in good agreement with the palynological data which indicate changes from birch forest-steppe to pine and cedar forests in the beginning of MWP, and then to birch-pine anthropogenically transformed forest-steppe in the LIA. Sharp maxima of non pollen palynomorphs Anabaena and Bryales/Algae at the 43-46 cm depth (similar to 900 a BP) possibly mark ecological crises in lake's biotope. Cold and dry conditions during the LIA were clearly expressed in pollen diagram of Manzherok Lake by decline of maxima of Siberian pine pollen and increase of Artemisia pollen. This study provides evidence to support a dry episode in the 9th century, wet climatic conditions in the MWP and a dry LIA in the Russian Altai Mountains in contrast to the opposite pattern revealed for arid regions of Central Asia and NW China during the same periods (Chen et al., 2010; Eichler et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2015). Our study indicates that, as a small and shallow lake located in the forest-steppe western foothills of the Altai Mountains, Manzherok Lake is more sensitive to high-resolution (less than centennial scale) climatic and environmental variations, in comparison with the large and deep Teletskoye Lake located in the mountain taiga zone of the northern Altai.

AB  - Poor reforestation outcomes imply failure to fulfill program goals and tend to erode institutional willpower and political momentum towards reforestation efforts, affecting both public and private support. However, program improvement in real reforestation projects is challenging, due to the conjunction of many different variables that mutually interact and feed back on each other inextricably. This study develops a comprehensive assessment framework for reforestation programs, for which technical and environmental information is gathered and related to indicators of performance in both the short- and mid-term. This assessment, tested on a case study, aimed to provide reliable end-results for survival and growth, revealed pitfalls in successful plantation establishment and taught us how to improve plantation performance and what the margin for this improvement was. The selected project was carried out on harsh site conditions, with different species, cultivation treatments and contractors, and was affected by the driest year on record. Plantation mortality was high and increased progressively over time, particularly in the short-term when the rate was 53% (rising to 83% after ten years), showing high variation between sites and species (Pinus pinaster and Quercus faginea died more than 94% after ten years while Junipus phoenicea only 40%). All the hardwoods and the juniper showed lower growth rate after ten years (average stem volume < 40 cm(3)) than pines (stem volume > 470 cm(3)). Technical variables (project planning and execution) had a relatively important impact on plantation performance in the first two years (11-29%), but decreased with time, whilst environmental variables (site and meteorological) were more important ten years after planting (>50%). In the short-term, soil moisture and meteorology during the planting season were identified as key factors that triggered the effects of both technical decisions (planting date and planting technique) and other environmental variables on performance. In the design phase, some decisions related to zoning, species selection and cultural treatments were related to poor performance. The results provide practical information and guidelines about all potential drivers of plantation performance and contribute to identify those aspects more related to success of forest restoration in Mediterranean drylands.

AB  - Novel communities that result from exposure to contaminants and other anthropogenic stressors often persist in ecosystems that have experienced regime shifts. Because these systems may not return to pre-disturbance conditions after removal of a stressor, understanding the ecological consequences of regime shifts has important implications for how restoration success is defined. Long-term observational studies can potentially identify regime shifts in disturbed ecosystems; however, experimental approaches may be necessary to demonstrate their ecological consequences. We report results of a long-term (28 years) observational study and a series of stream mesocosm experiments that investigated a regime shift in a mining-contaminated watershed. We tested the hypothesis that establishment of a novel, metal-tolerant macroinvertebrate community in a previously contaminated stream impeded recovery of sensitive species, despite significant improvements in water quality over the past two decades. We observed significant improvements in abundance and species richness, but differences in community composition and trophic structure persisted downstream from a former source of metal contamination. These downstream communities were dominated by large, metal-tolerant caddisflies that likely impeded colonization by metal-sensitive groups (e.g. grazing mayflies). Mesocosm experiments conducted with reference and downstream communities demonstrated that novel communities retained their tolerance to metals, but were significantly more sensitive to other stressors. We suggest that the failure of downstream communities to recover represented a contaminant-induced regime shift that resulted from the sustained dominance of metal-tolerant species. Synthesis and applications. Restoration ecologists generally consider increased species diversity or abundance of recreationally important species as indicators of restoration success. However, few stream restoration projects have quantified ecological resilience, and none have included a significant experimental component. Our research is the first to experimentally demonstrate that novel communities in a stream recovering from historical metal pollution have lower resilience to other (e.g. non-metal) stressors. These results have important implications for how restoration success is defined. In systems where the return to pre-disturbance conditions is unlikely, a better understanding of the ecological resilience of novel communities may be critical for assessing restoration success. We suggest that resilience to novel stressors is an important indicator of restoration effectiveness that may be applicable in other aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Plants are open, irreversible and non-equilibrium systems that live via mass-and energy exchanges with the environment, and therefore, are amenable to a thermodynamic treatment: in fact, they may be considered "energy converters", because their metabolism is nothing else than a controlled ability to transform energy from one form (solar) into another (chemical energy suitable to cell metabolism) and to activate and maintain reactions at cellular and molecular level-promoting the plant growth. This paper presents an original model based on mass conservation and on the First-and Second Law of Thermodynamics, which results in a set of equations that allow for the calculation of the Primary Productivity (NPP) and consequently lead to a measure of the plant growth. The model is lumped, steady-state and totally deterministic, because no primary process is modelled in detail: the control volume Is a portion of the universe that contains the plant and its immediate surroundings (atmosphere and the relevant portion of the soil), and the solution is strongly depending on the imposed boundary conditions. In such a formulation, the tree is considered as a non-equilibrium system evolving at a steady rate, and the only implicit assumption is the local equilibrium hypothesis. The general evolution equations are derived, and their steady-state form is analysed in detail. The approach is based on the calculation of the exergy in-and outflows from the control volume. Based on reasonably accurate empirical data, the exergy budget shows that the overall exergy conversion efficiency is quite low in plants and is very sensitive to even small changes in the environmental condition and to the adopted evapotranspiration model, as it would have been expected. The model is applied to a mature specimen of pines sylvestris and the results are compared with some literature data: despite neglecting the real chemo-physical details, the model reproduces the most salient characters of the tree growth. The sensitivity of the results to the tree age as well to the main model parameters is also calculated. The application of the same model to different species may reveal asymmetries in the "adaptability" of certain genotypes to different environments. On the more specific engineering side, the model may see an immediate application in the estimate of CO2 capture by plants.

AB  - A 341 cm long sediment sequence was recovered from the unofficially named Raffles So on Raffles O, outer Scoresby Sund region, East Greenland. The sediment sequence consists in the upper part (0-230 cm) of a stratified gyttja enriched in organic carbon and biogenic silica whereas the lower core part (235-341 cm) is composed of terrigenous, consolidated glacio-limnic sediments. C-14-AMS measurements indicate that the sediment sequence represents the entire Holocene lake history from 10,030 calibrated radiocarbon years.
   The geochemical parameters (opal, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN)) and the total diatom concentration show similar developments during the Holocene, and reflect changes in biological production and nutrient input into the lake. These records clearly reveal a broad Holocene TOC-opal-maximum interval between 5200 and 1800 cal. yrs BP.
   The diatom flora consisted of 66 taxa representing 20 genera but only seven taxa were abundant and, sometimes, these were monospecifically dominant during the Holocene. In the sediment core from Raffles So four successive stratigraphical zones can be distinguished. Accumulation of diatom valves began at 9900 cal. yrs BP with a Stephanodiscus minutulus (Kutz.) Cleve and Moller dominated assemblage (stratigraphic zone 1) followed by a diatom flora dominated by Cyclotella pseudostelligera Hustedt and, less frequently, by Diatoma tenuis Agardh (9400 until 5900 cal. yrs BP, zone 2). Cyclotella sp. A, a taxon which belongs to the Cyclotella rossii-comensis-tripartita-complex, was the dominant floral element between 5200 and 1800 cal. yrs BP (zone 3). From 1800 cal. yrs BP, the periphytic taxa Fragilaria capucina var. gracilis (Ostr.) Hustedt and F. capucina var. rumpens (Kutz.) Lange-Bertalot attained highest relative abundances, also almost monospecifically (zone 4).
   The distribution and composition of the diatom assemblages in the sediment record from Raffles So probably reflect past variations in the extent of the lake-ice cover during the growing season. More or less ice-free conditions during summer may have prevailed during the early Holocene until ca. 1800 cal. yrs BP, which allowed growth of planktonic diatoms (Cyclotella taxa) in the pelagic lake region. From 1800 cal. yrs BP, colder conditions lead to a perennial lake-ice cover with a small ice-free moat in summer which favored the growth of periphytic, littoral species (Fragilaria capucina varieties).

AB  - Background: Knowledge of the different kinds of tree communities that currently exist can provide a baseline for assessing the ecological attributes of forests and monitoring future changes. Forest inventory data can facilitate the development of this baseline knowledge across broad extents, but they first must be classified into forest community types. Here, we compared three alternative classifications across the United States using data from over 117,000 U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots.
   Methods: Each plot had three forest community type labels: (1) "FIA" types were assigned by the FIA program using a supervised method; (2) "USNVC" types were assigned via a key based on the U.S. National Vegetation Classification; (3) "empirical" types resulted from unsupervised clustering of tree species information. We assessed the degree to which analog classes occurred among classifications, compared indicator species values, and used random forest models to determine how well the classifications could be predicted using environmental variables.
   Results: The classifications generated groups of classes that had broadly similar distributions, but often there was no one-to-one analog across the classifications. The longleaf pine forest community type stood out as the exception: it was the only class with strong analogs across all classifications. Analogs were most lacking for forest community types with species that occurred across a range of geographic and environmental conditions, such as loblolly pine types. Indicator species metrics were generally high for the USNVC, suggesting that USNVC classes are floristically well-defined. The empirical classification was best predicted by environmental variables. The most important predictors differed slightly but were broadly similar across all classifications, and included slope, amount of forest in the surrounding landscape, average minimum temperature, and other climate variables.
   Conclusions: The classifications have similarities and differences that reflect their differing approaches and objectives. They are most consistent for forest community types that occur in a relatively narrow range of environmental conditions, and differ most for types with wide-ranging tree species. Environmental variables at a variety of scales were important for predicting all classifications, though strongest for the empirical and FIA, suggesting that each is useful for studying how forest communities respond to of multi-scale environmental processes, including global change drivers.

AB  - Modem Rhynchonellida, Terebratulida, Thecideida and a few inarticulated brachiopods were collected live or soon after death at 30 locations from depths of 2-3940 in, from the equator to high latitudes covering the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Caribbean and Mediterranean Oceans/Seas. Well-preserved fibers of the secondary layer combined with Sr (450-1928 mg/kg), Mn (1-199 mg/kg) and Fe (1-610 mg/kg) contents confirm, with few exceptions, the excellent preservation of the modem brachiopod material.
   Evaluation of the stable isotope compositions was conducted on 276 specimens and on 374 published samples for a total database of 650 samples from 80 locations. It revealed that oxygen isotope incorporation into shell calcite (secondary layer) of modem articulated brachiopods, in most cases, occurs in equilibrium with the ambient water and as such reflects surrounding environmental conditions. Thecideida as a group (shallow water and low latitude) incorporate oxygen isotopes (-3.04 parts per thousand to +0.35 parts per thousand) into shell calcite in equilibrium with their ambient water. A large majority of genera and species of the Terebratulida (shallow water and low-mid latitude) also incorporate oxygen (-2.30parts per thousand to +3.48parts per thousand) into shell calcite in isotopic equilibrium with their surrounding water. In contrast, equilibrium incorporation of oxygen isotopes into shell calcite by the Rhynchonellida is uncertain, but a vital effect probably applies to the Craniida. The question of equilibrium/disequilibrium incorporation of carbon isotopes into shell calcite of modem brachiopods remains unresolved at this time.
   Isotope compositions range up to 4.5 parts per thousand, 5.6 parts per thousand and 1.5 parts per thousand for delta(13)C, and up to 5.5 parts per thousand, 5.9 parts per thousand and 0.3 parts per thousand for delta(18)O, for shallow-water low, mid, and high latitude brachiopods, respectively. Strontium isotopes of modem brachiopods, as expected, show no significant variation with location, latitude, water depth, temperature, salinity and general water conditions. Once local habitat and ecological influences of fossil brachiopods from similar latitudes are considered, their isotopic/elemental values should be valuable diagenetic indicators and important oceanographic/chemostratigraphic proxies.

AB  - Microrefugia are small areas that support favourable climate and allow species to persist during regional and global climate changes. Dolines in karst landscapes may provide such areas for many climate change-vulnerable species. Here we provide a better understanding on how plant species indicate changes in their environment (temperature, soil moisture and light availability) after a few years of partial canopy removal from dolines and their close surroundings (logged areas: >1 ha). We place our results in the context of the most widely used forest management practices within the study area (Mecsek Mts, Hungary), in addition to presenting a general framework for the maintenance of doline microrefugia in forested karst landscapes. Three types of habitats were investigated: dolines before logging, dolines after logging, and the forested plateau. Three large dolines and three sites on the plateau were selected for vegetation sampling. All dolines were sampled before logging and 5-10 years after partial canopy removal. Logging resulted in a 50-80% reduction of canopy cover in the dolines and their close surroundings. We established a transect across each doline from north to south passing through doline bottoms, and across each plateau site. We estimated the percentage cover of vascular plant species (tree saplings - up to 1 m in height, shrubs and herbs) along the transects using 1 m x 1 m vegetation plots, determined the diagnostic species of the doline and plateau habitats, and used multivariate methods and linear mixed-effects models during analyses. Plant species indicated clear gradients of the main microclimatic factors within the dolines and that significant changes took place after logging. Canopy removal caused substantial changes in the main microclimatic factors of most doline microhabitats (e.g., south-facing slopes). The vegetation of the dolines before logging indicated moister conditions than that of the plateau and cooler and shadier conditions than that of the dolines after logging. These and our previous results suggest that logging may directly and indirectly influence dolines to be microrefugia under global warming. By applying our framework to refugia conservation and management for the karst landscape in the Mecsek Mts, we can conclude that the protection of old forests and natural forest dynamics in as many large dolines as possible and the implementation of close-to-nature forestry practices may be essential to maintain regional biodiversity in the long run.

AB  - The relevance. Among the most urgent problems attracting human interest are the problems of energy. They affect directly or indirectly on human society and the environment. The human activity is associated with permanent use of natural energy resources for supplying people with vital functions: heat and light in houses, food, transportation, clothes, etc. At present, in many parts of Siberia there is still no centralized energy service. An important feature of mountainous countries is considerable dispersion of consumers requiring electric and thermal energy, uneven workload during the year and the lack of centralized sources of energy. The main energy sources in mountainous areas are diesel power plants. The cost of the energy produced is very high, particularly in remote areas. Due to the concept of mountain regions development with using renewable energy sources it is possible to solve the energy problem.
   The aim of the research is to evaluate the possible contribution of wind energy to resource conservation and ecology in mountains regions of the Altai Republic in the frames of intensive development of tourism and recreational activities.
   The objects of the research are the wind regime in lower troposphere over the southern part of Siberia; orographic conditions and their influence on the wind regime; wind-power potential of mountain areas of the Altai Republic
   The methods of the research are the upper-air atmosphere sounding; the construction of a mathematical model of the wind velocity field in different altitude levels; assessment and analysis of influence of different topography on wind speed.
   Results. It is shown that the wind velocity is not enough for wind-power engineering in conditions of intermountain basins and wide valleys. The analysis of air-climatological indicators of wind velocity and the data of high-mountain meteorological stations on the tops and watersheds have shown that in terms of openness of the horizon the wind-power potential is sufficient for effective operation of wind power plants of different capacity. For the watershed areas higher than 1500 m, the power density fluctuates from 150 to 850 W/m(2) that makes it possible to use wind energy plants of low and medium power. The regions with wind power density of more than 500 W/m(2) can be considered as the areas of high energy. Such zones can be marked in the central part of the Altai Mountains, rising from 2200 m.

AB  - Sustainable development principles are leading earthwork companies to use all-natural materials extracted from the construction site to build the infrastructure. Natural materials with low characteristics must be improved. For dry soils, the common solution is to increase the compaction energy or add important quantities of water to reach the target dry density and bearing capacity. To reduce the environmental impact of their activities, the use of industrial organic products has been proposed. The aim of this study was to assess the potential benefits that could be expected from the use of these non-traditional treatments in earthworks with a well-recognised environmental impact assessment methodology.
   Three non-traditional products were selected as follows: an acid solution (AS), an enzymatic solution (ES) and a calcium lignosulfonate (LS). For each of these categories, geotechnical properties such as compaction, bearing capacity, unconfined compressive strength and stiffness were first determined. Based on these results, the construction strategy for which non-traditional additives lead to greater improvement of soil properties was defined. The environmental balance of each option was then determined via a comparative process life cycle assessment study that considered ten impact categories.
   An experimental study showed the ability of enzymatic and lignosulfonate additives to improve soil characteristics with significant savings of water at the construction stage. The purpose of the study was also to compare the global environmental impact of each treatment strategy defined from laboratory investigations. The life cycle assessment results showed that some construction strategies lead to a significant reduction in the environmental impact compared with the reference strategy. However, these environmental improvements are strongly linked to the choice of the construction strategy and site conditions as discussed in the sensitivity analysis.
   Within the three tested non-traditional additives, enzymatic and lignosulfonate treatments showed an association of technical and environmental interest for the compaction of dry soils. As demonstrated in the sensitivity analysis, these benefits are achieved when the production and transport steps have limited environmental impact. Thus, despite an important transportation distance for enzymatic additive, the small quantities that must be used (0.002 % by dry weight) have a limited contribution on the global environmental impact. In contrast, the production step strongly impacts the treatment with lignosulfonates. Moreover, environmental interest remains strongly dependent on the site conditions and construction strategy, which is why the adopted methodology can accurately perform an initial evaluation before implementing a soil treatment with a non-traditional product.

AB  - In this study, the objects of research were circular and concave karstic depressions, called sinkholes or dolines. All these negative topographic anomalies were previously recognized as safe havens for cool-adapted species on karstic plateaus. However, the high geodiversity of doline landforms on karst plateaus does not ensure that all dolines are really safe havens that should be considered for conservation status. We propose the use of indicator species to identify different dolines' "sections" and their overall types to identify dolines with high conservation value for cool-adapted species. We aimed to divide dolines into landform-vegetation units (LVU) according to basic geomorphic characteristics and indicator plant species. We carried out intensive sampling of vegetation plots (n = 286) across 10 dolines of different geomorphology ranging from 20 m to 100 m in diameter and from 2 m to 20 m in depth. Each doline was classified into a maximum of four LVUs: bottom, lower slope, upper slope and top. Vascular plants were used as a proxy for ecosystem biodiversity and indicator of ecological conditions. The diversity of vascular plant communities was sampled along N-S transects from one side of the doline over the bottom to the other side. Geodiversity parameters of individual dolines were calculated using a high-resolution digital elevation model (LiDAR / Light Detection And Ranging) and their significance was established by permutation test in CCA (Canonical Correlation Analysis). The floristic gradient was established by the first axis of PCoA (Principal Coordinates Analysis) and shows the species turn-over along the trajectory. Discrete plant communities were determined by TWINSPAN (Two-Way Indicator Species ANnalysis) classification. Based on this analysis, transects were disintegrated into four LVUs. Communities within LVUs were compared by Ellenberg indicator values and according to habitat preference of species. The indicator (also termed diagnostic) plant species were calculated by fidelity measure and related to ecological conditions along transects. We found that all four LVUs appear only in dolines that are at least 13.5 m deep and those can serve as a good safe haven for cool-adapted species in foreseen climatic change. We also confirmed that doline depth is the most important factors influencing the plant community composition. The results can be directly transformed to other karst regions (karst plateaus) with the same zonal vegetation, but calibration is needed in case of their application in other areas.

AB  - The paper presents the results of the standardization of administrative costs of forest districts using the Management Difficulty Index (STG) for forest districts. It discusses the basis for the structuring of the STG for forest districts as well as standardization of administrative costs of the regional directorates of the State Forests using the source data from 2014. The source data for the administrative costs incurred by forest districts as well as the data on natural -forest conditions and annual economic tasks of forest districts were obtained from the State Forests Information System database for all forest districts in the country, the Bureau for Forest Management and Geodesy and the Forest Data Bank. Information on the social environment of forest districts was obtained from the Local Data Bank of the Central Statistical Office and the data on the number of cases of theft and damage to forests directly from forest districts. The obtained results indicate that the index value calculated for the regional directorates of the State Forests (RDSF) was determined by the number of subordinate forest districts and index values obtained by them. The highest STG value in 2014 was reported for: Katowice RDSF 153.43, Szczecin RDSF 145.2 and Wroclaw RDSF 128.7 points. The lowest STG value was recorded in the Warsaw RDSF 49.39, Krakow RDSF 53.14 and Gdansk RDSF 64.02 points. The calculated differences between the total administrative costs incurred by forest districts and the total standard administrative costs calculated on the basis of the mean value of 1 point of STG for forest districts in the State Forests for 2014 allowed dividing the regional directorates of the State Forests into two groups. The first one consists of 10 regional directorates, whose total actual administrative activity costs were lower than total standard administrative costs (negative values). The other group consists of 7 regional directorates, whose total standard administrative costs were lower than actual costs incurred in 2014 (positive values). STG indices for forest districts can be successfully used to standardize the total costs of forest districts. They should be a helpful tool in developing more objective methods of shaping the employment level in forest districts taking into account natural-forest conditions and economic tasks being implemented in these organizational units.

AB  - The application of physiological measures to conservation monitoring has been gaining momentum and, while a suite of physiological traits are available to ascertain disturbance and condition in wildlife populations, glucocorticoids (i.e., GCs; cortisol and corticosterone) are the most heavily employed. The interpretation of GC levels as sensitive indicators of population change necessitates that GCs and metrics of population persistence are linked. However, the relationship between GCs and fitness may be highly context-dependent, changing direction, or significance, depending on the GC measure, fitness metric, life history stage, or other intrinsic and extrinsic contexts considered. We examined the relationship between baseline plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels measured at two periods of the breeding season and three metrics of fitness (offspring quality, reproductive output, and adult survival) in female Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor). Specifically, we investigated whether (1) a relationship between baseline CORT metrics and fitness exists in our population, (2) whether the inclusion of energetic contexts, such as food availability, reproductive investment, or body mass, could alter or improve the strength of the relationship between CORT and fitness, and (3) whether energetic contexts could better predict fitness compared to CORT metrics. Importantly, we investigated these relationships in both natural conditions and under an experimental manipulation of foraging profitability (feather clipping) to determine the influence of an environmental constraint on GC-fitness relationships. We found a lack of relationship between baseline CORT and both short-and long-term metrics of fitness in control and clipped birds. In contrast, loss in body mass over reproduction positively predicted reproductive output (number of chicks leaving the nest) in control birds; however, the relationship was characterized by a low R-2 (5%), limiting the predictive capacity, and therefore the application potential, of such a measure in a conservation setting. Our results stress the importance of ground-truthing GC-fitness relationships and indicate that baseline GCs will likely not be easily employed as conservation biomarkers across some species and life history stages. Given the accumulating evidence of temporally dynamic, inconsistent, and context-dependent GC-fitness relationships, placing effort towards directly measuring fitness traits, rather than plasma GC levels, will likely be more worthwhile for many conservation endeavours.

AB  - The effects of abamectin (Vertimec (R) 18 EC) on Eisenia andrei were evaluated under tropical conditions through acute and chronic tests. Tests were performed using a Tropical Artificial Soil (TAS), aiming to deliver tropical ecotoxicological data, and a natural soil (NS) contaminated in situ, aiming to simulate realistic exposure scenarios for Brazilian strawberry crop fields. To these ends, adaptations of the standard international protocols were performed: coconut shell residue was used as a source of organic matter in replacement for sphagnum peat moss in TAS and all tests were conducted under a temperature of 25 +/- 2 degrees C. In the acute and chronic tests with TAS, the pesticide was incorporated in concentrations of 0-14 and 0-10.5 mg abamectin/kg soil, respectively. In the NS tests, the organisms were exposed to samples of soil sprayed in situ with water (Control), the recommended field dose of 0.9 L Vertimec (R) 18 EC/ha (RD); twice this dosage (2DR); and 2DR: control soil dilutions (12.5; 25; 50; and 75%). The TAS tests indicated LC50 values of 7.64 mg a.i./kg (14 days) and 8.65 mg a.i./kg (28 days) and chronic NOEC < 0.88 mg a.i./kg. The organisms exposed to the pesticide also presented morphological alterations (thinning, discoloration of the posterior region; constriction in different regions of the body; fragmentation, and loss of segments, mainly in the posterior region), behavioral alterations (lethargy or slowed response to mechanical stimuli), and weight loss. The average number of juveniles produced decreased from 33 (Control) to 3 in the lowest pesticide treatment (0.875 mg a.i./kg TAS), and no reproduction was observed at higher pesticide concentrations. There was no significant response to any parameter analyzed in the tests performed with NS, even for the worst-case scenario (2DR). Results suggest low risk of Vertimec (R) 18 EC to earthworms if the recommended dosage for strawberry crop and good agricultural practices are followed. It is important to consider, however, that only one application of the product was evaluated in the NS tests, whereas multiple applications as well as inadequate use of pesticides are common in the main Brazilian strawberry region.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) is an important limiting nutrient in aquatic ecosystems and knowledge of P cycling is fundamental for reducing harmful algae blooms and other negative effects in water. Despite their importance, the characteristics of P cycling under changing nutrient conditions in shallow lakes were poorly investigated. In this study, in situ incubation experiments were conducted in a natural riparian zone in the main diversion channel used for water transfer into Lake Taihu (Wangyu River). Variations in microbial biomass, dissolved P fractions (organic and inorganic), and alkaline phosphatase activity (bulk APA and specific APA) were determined after incubation with and without the addition of P and nitrogen (N) (4 total water treatments: +P, +N, +NP, and control). Experiments were conducted during two seasons (late spring and early fall) to account for natural differences in nutrient levels that may occur in situ. Our results demonstrated that low levels of DRP may not necessarily indicate P limitation. Phytoplankton exhibited serial N limitation with P stress in May, such that chlorophyll a (Chl a) increased significantly with N addition, while the limiting nutrient shifted to P in October and phytoplankton biomass increased with P addition. Phytoplankton contributed greatly to APA production and was significantly influenced by P bioavailability, yet high levels of bulk APA were also not necessarily indicative of P limitation. In contrast to phytoplankton, bacteria were less P stressed. As a consequence of enhanced utilization of dissolved reactive P (DRP) and dissolved organic P (DOP), +N treatment elevated APA significantly. By contrast, APA could be repressed to low values and phytoplankton converted a large portion of DRP to DOP with P addition. But this was not consistent with bacteria APA (bact-APA) in the absence or presence of abundant phytoplankton biomass. The correlation between bulk APA and DRP was good at separate sites and discrepant for the whole data set. Regulation of APA was demonstrated by an inverse hyperbolic relationship between bulk APA, specific APA, and DRP, with a transition from high to low activity occurring between 20 and 50 mu g L-1. This study provides a better understanding of how APA and P cycling change with nutrient perturbations in Lake Taihu system. The obtained results can help understanding the process of P cycling in water and providing a reference for nutrient control in the water transfer project.

AB  - Since the early 20th century Patagonian arid steppes have been subjected to overgrazing that led to the degradation of plant communities. We hypothesized that the interplay among grazing history, plant-plant spatial interactions and species traits affects recovery and assemblage of shrub community after short-term abandonment in north-eastern Patagonian arid steppe (Peninsula Valdes, Argentina). We compared six sites (two in grazed pastures, and four in short-term ungrazed pastures, two of which intensively grazed, while the other two low intensity grazed in the past) with regard to: shrub cover percentage (10 m x 10 m plots); shrub patch dimension, species richness, and spatial interactions among shrub species depending on patch dimension (patches sampled along transects); species richness and composition, vertical relations among species, and traits related to avoidance strategies and disturbance (1 m x 1 m plots sampled along transects). Our results indicated that recovery processes in abandoned pastures act through the increase in shrub patch size, formation of new patches, change in patch composition and richness, and in within-patch relations among shrub species. No significant differences were found between sites subjected to different past grazing intensities. The increase in shrub cover was due to a significant expansion of the dominant shrub Chuquiraga avellanedae. The mechanism of new patch formation and spread was mainly based on facilitative processes acting between the dwarf shrubs, poorly palatable and disliked by wild herbivores, and young individuals of the dominant species emerging from their canopy. As patch size increased, dwarf shrubs were covered by taller ones or grew at the edge of the patch, indicating a phase of competitive exclusion. Plant-plant spatial interactions involved changes in the composition of plant traits linked to avoidance strategies, which were indicators of grazed conditions and of plots with shrub cover lower than 50%, while less need for defence against animal browsing was highlighted in ungrazed pastures and shrub-dominated plots. As the density of herbivores is recognized as the key factor in biodiversity conservation and ecosystem recovery, management plans devoted to conservation of biodiversity and forage resources should work to recreate grazing conditions close to the wild ones or to impose a short-term period of ecosystem rest that allows the plant community to recover.

Two areas are included in the study, and in total they include an altitudinal span from sea-level up to 2400 m a.s.l. The applied indicator systems are the six values defined by Ellenberg et al.

Ecological indicators 8, 57-681. Mean indicator values are calculated for each altitudinal band, and they show significant linear increasing or decreasing trends, significant unimodal (quadratic) trends or no significant altitudinal trend. The altitudinal variation in mean indicator values is discussed in relation to general environmental conditions such as bedrock, soil characteristics, topography, summer temperature, light, snow and distribution of major vegetation types. The main differences between the altitudinal bands as shown by a PCA analysis indicate that the highest bands, representing the high alpine zone (more than 1800 m a.s.l.) strongly differ from the others. The altitudinal gradient is mainly associated with variation in temperature, nitrogen indicators and some of the Raunkiaer life forms (primarily the Phanerophytes, Nanophanerophytes, Geophytes and Therophytes). The two tested temperature indicator systems tested were highly linearly correlated, but the altitudinal variation in respiration value followed the general temperature lapse rate better than the Ellenberg temperature indicator value. Indicators of high soil moisture have their optima at intermediate altitudes. The uppermost bands in Aurland show lower mean temperature indicator values and a higher snow indicator value compared to bands at the same altitude in Jotunheimen. This may partly be explained as a result of the Massenerhebung effect. Relationships between altitudinal distribution patterns of some vascular plants in Aurland and their Ellenberg temperature indicator value indicate that the values should be revised to better suit Norwegian conditions.

AB  - The purpose of the publication is to study the current state of the organization and methods of accounting for the costs of organic production from the point of view of environmental and economic accounting in Ukraine and recommendations for adapting accounting support for managing the costs of production of organic products to the requirements of the formation of integrated information of environmental and economic accounting. To determine the general trends in the development of accounting support for managing the costs of the production of organic products, the methods of induction and deduction were used. The economic and statistical method was used to analyse the state of production of organic products, and the observation method was used to study the state of accounting for the real costs of producing organic food.
   The state of development of organic production for the period from 2000 to 2019 in the world, Europe and Ukraine has been analysed. It has been determined that at the micro level, in the conditions of organic production, environmental and economic accounting is an information system that allows you to monitor compliance with the requirements of domestic and international legislation regarding the implementation of this type of activity, and, at the next stages, to form consistent and comparable statistical indicators to account for the relationship " links between the environment and the economy. In the absence of regulatory accounting in Ukraine in the conditions of organic production, the formation of internal regulatory accounting regulations is a prerequisite for the effective management of such production. The formed system of cost accounting objects, considering the specifics of technological processes of operators of organic production, will allow organizing a separate accounting of costs for the production of organic products, inorganic products, and products of the transition period. A nomenclature of cost accounting items in terms of production of organic production is proposed, the use of which will make it possible to distinguish in accounting the expenses allowed by legislation in terms of production of organic production from expenses for which there are certain restrictions. The features of the functions of primary documents reflecting the costs of organic production are determined and ways to improve the documentation of production processes are proposed. This will improve the information support for product quality control and will allow adapting the accounting support for managing the production costs of organic products to the requirements of the formation of integrated information on environmental and economic accounting.

AB  - Despite the exponential increase of studies on plastic debris in recent years, there are still few works focusing on the problem as it relates to inland waters: little is known about the accumulation and dispersion dynamics on lake shores, and there are no standardized sampling methods for monitoring purposes. The accumulation of plastic litter in natural habitats also threatens the resident organisms. In this paper, we investigated the abundance and accumulation of plastic particles, ranging in size from 1 to 50 mm, from the beach sediment of three volcanic lakes in Central Italy: Albano, Bracciano, and Vico. The collection was designed to define the most important variables that one must consider in order to obtain a representative sample of plastic litter in a lake environment. In view of the high heterogeneity of sampling protocols used, comparison among the obtained results is limited and sometimes impossible. By using one of the proposed sampling methodologies, and critically analyzing the results, we aimed to highlight a possible monitoring criterion and to identify specific elements that can be meaningful and representative. The samples were collected in May and September 2017. For each lake, we sampled plastic items and sediments from two beaches. Albano contained the largest amount of plastic (in weight), while Bracciano had the largest number of particles. Our observations lead us to infer that the number of particles is the parameter most sensitive to environmental variations, as well as the more suitable for monitoring with greater definition the differences between sites. Moreover, sampling should be taken in different seasons, following a sampling pattern that includes at least two beaches placed in strategic positions with respect to wind and waves. In order to identify new indicators to evaluate the entry points of plastic into the food web, we collected, from the same sites analyzed, some specimens of the Talitrid Amphipod Cryptorchestia garbinii, a detritivorous species having a critical role in debris turnover of these environments. To investigate the microplastic (MP) ingestion in natural conditions, we analyzed their digestive tracts with both Nile red staining method and micro-FTIR spectroscopy. The analyses confirmed that C. garbinii was able to ingest plastics in natural conditions. Therefore, it can signify one of the entry points for microplastics (MPs) in the trophic chain. This observation constitutes the first evidence of MP ingestion in this species.

AB  - A late Pliocene - early Pleistocene, 2.9-2.0Ma, diatom record from the Antarctic Geological Drilling Program (ANDRILL) MIS drillcore AND-1B is presented. This core, recovered from beneath the Ross Ice Shelf south of Ross Island, comprises multiple diatomaceous-sediment units deposited during interglacial periods with open water over the core site. These represent interglacial phases of orbitally paced climate cycles and are punctuated by glacial advances. Extant diatom assemblages have limited presence in the late Pliocene record, which makes environmental interpretation less straight forward. We employ modern ecological data in combination with late Pliocene to present variation in diatom assemblages across the Southern Ocean oceanic fronts based on DSDP/ODP diatom biostratigraphic data to evaluate paleoenvironmental change for the 2.9-2.0 Ma interval of the AND-1B core. The diatom assemblages from AND-1B record a progressive environmental change through the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene. A relatively warm period with potential SST of up to 4 degrees C at ca. 2.9Ma was succeeded by a reduction of warm water species and an increase of taxa associated with more southerly water masses until 2.58 Ma (at isotope stage G1). Younger, early Pleistocene, diatomaceous units are dominated by extinct Rouxia, Thalassiosira species and newly described Fragilariopsis species indicative of cold open water and drift ice. The last recorded cooling step occurs at the top of the interval studied (ca 2.0) Ma indicated by the trace abundance of Fragilariopsis and Actinocyclus species present in modern sea ice assemblages but absent in the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene AND-1B record, even though many of its species had their first occurrences during the Pliocene. The extant sea ice assemblage occurs with an abundance of 2-29% (average 10%) in the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene AND-1B record implying that the modern sea ice and ice shelf polar conditions were not established within the studied interval. The most frequently applied sea ice indicator, Fragilariopsis curta, is consistently present in low to moderate abundance (1-22%) together with Chaetoceros resting spores (2-30%) through the 2.9-2.0 Ma interval. The diatom assemblage shifts indicate a dynamic environment with an overall trend towards colder conditions after ca. 2.6 Ma but does not reach the Holocene configuration. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Auscultation constitutes a fast, non-invasive and low-cost tool widely used to diagnose respiratory diseases in most of the health centres. However, the acoustic training and expertise acquired by the physician is still crucial to provide a reliable diagnosis of the status of the lung. Each wrong diagnosis increases the risk to the health of patients and the costs associated with the treatment of the disease detected. A wheezing detection system can be useful to the physician to minimize the subjectivity of the interpretation of the breathing sounds, misdiagnoses due to stress and elucidating complex acoustic scenes (such as louder background noises). Highlight that the presence of wheeze sounds is one of the main indicators of respiratory disorders from airway obstructions. This work presents an expert and intelligent system to detect wheeze sounds based on a recursive algorithm that combines orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization (ONMF) and the sparsity descriptor Gini index. The recursive algorithm is composed of four stages. The first stage is based on ONMF modelling to factorize the spectral bases as dissimilar as possible. The second stage clusters the ONMF bases into two categories: wheezing and normal breath. The third stage proposes a novel stopping criterion that controls the loss of wheezing spectral content at the expense of removing normal breath content in the recursive algorithm. Finally, the fourth stage determines the patient's condition to locate the temporal intervals in which wheeze sounds are active for unhealthy patients. Experimental results report that the proposed method: (i) provides the best detection performance compared to the recent state-of-the-art wheezing detection approaches, achieving the highest robustness in noisy environments; and (ii) reliably distinguishes the patient's condition (healthy/unhealthy). The strengths of the proposed method are the following: (i) its unsupervised nature since it does not depend on any training stage to learn in advanced the sounds of interest (wheezing). This fact could make this method attractive to be used in clinical settings because wheezing sound databases are often unavailable; and (ii) the modelling of the spectral behaviour by means of a common feature, the sparsity, that represents the typically energy distributions shown by most of the wheeze and normal breath sounds.

AB  - Ruminant production contributes to emissions of nitrogen (N) to the environment, principally ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O) and di-nitrogen (N-2) to air, nitrate (NO3 (-)) to groundwater and particulate N to surface waters. Variation in dietary N intake will particularly affect excretion of urinary N, which is much more vulnerable to losses than is faecal N. Our objective is to review dietary effects on the level and form of N excreted in cattle urine, as well as its consequences for emissions of N2O. The quantity of N excreted in urine varies widely. Urinary N excretion, in particular that of urea N, is decreased upon reduction of dietary N intake or an increase in the supply of energy to the rumen microorganisms and to the host animal itself. Most of the N in urine (from 50% to well over 90%) is present in the form of urea. Other nitrogenous components include purine derivatives (PD), hippuric acid, creatine and creatinine. Excretion of PD is related to rumen microbial protein synthesis, and that of hippuric acid to dietary concentration of degradable phenolic acids. The N concentration of cattle urine ranges from 3 to 20 g/l. High-dietary mineral levels increase urine volume and lead to reduced urinary N concentration as well as reduced urea concentration in plasma and milk. In lactating dairy cattle, variation in urine volume affects the relationship between milk urea and urinary N excretion, which hampers the use of milk urea as an accurate indicator of urinary N excretion. Following its deposition in pastures or in animal houses, ubiquitous microorganisms in soil and waters transform urinary N components into ammonium (NH4 (+)), and thereafter into NO3 (-) and ultimately in N-2 accompanied with the release of N2O. Urinary hippuric acid, creatine and creatinine decompose more slowly than urea. Hippuric acid may act as a natural inhibitor of N2O emissions, but inhibition conditions have not been defined properly yet. Environmental and soil conditions at the site of urine deposition or manure application strongly influence N2O release. Major dietary strategies to mitigating N2O emission from cattle operations include reducing dietary N content or increasing energy content, and increasing dietary mineral content to increase urine volume. For further reduction of N2O emission, an integrated animal nutrition and excreta management approach is required.

AB  - Increases in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) in the atmosphere will significantly affect a wide variety of terrestrial fauna and flora. Because of tight atmospheric-oceanic coupling, shallow-water marine species are also expected to be affected by increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. one proposed way to slow increases in atmospheric pCO(2) is to sequester CO2 in the deep sea. Thus, over the next few centuries marine species will be exposed to changing seawater chemistry caused by ocean-atmospheric exchange and/or deep-ocean sequestration. This initial case study on one allogromiid foraminiferal species (Allogromia laticollaris) was conducted to begin to ascertain the effect of elevated pCO(2) on benthic Foraminifera, which are a major meiofaunal constituent of shallow- and deep-water marine communities. Cultures of this thecate foraminiferan protist were used for 10-14-day experiments. Experimental treatments were executed in an incubator that controlled CO2 (15000; 30000: 60000; 90000; 200000 ppm), temperature and humidity; atmospheric controls (i.e., similar to 375 ppm CO2) were executed simultaneously. Although the experimental elevated pCO(2) values are far above foreseeable surface water pCO(2), they were selected to represent the spectrum of conditions expected for the benthos if deep-sea CO2 sequestration becomes a reality. Survival was assessed in two independent ways: pseudopodial presence/absence and measurement of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is an indicator of cellular energy. Substantial proportions of A. laticollaris populations survived 200000 ppm CO2 although the mean of the median [ATP] of survivors was statistically lower for this treatment than for that of atmospheric control specimens. After individuals that had been incubated in 200000 ppm CO2 for 12 days were transferred to atmospheric conditions for -24 It, the [ATP] of live specimens (survivors) approximated those of the comparable atmospheric control treatment. Incubation in 200000 ppm CO2 also resulted in reproduction by some individuals. Results suggest that certain Foraminifera are able to tolerate deep-sea CO2 sequestration and perhaps thrive as a result of elevated pCO(2) that is predicted for the next few centuries, in a high-pCO(2) world. Thus, allogromiid foraminiferal "blooms" may result from climate change. Furthermore, because allogromiids consume a variety of prey, it is likely that they will be major players in ecosystem dynamics of future coastal sedimentary environments. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

KW  - METALS
AB  - Properties of soil sorption complex are thought to be one of the most important elements which affect its fertility and properties of plants. Extended sorption complex is the element which immobilizes and absorbs a variety of soil contaminants. Characteristics of sorption complex are affected by e.g. organic matter, humic relationships which occur during decomposition of organic matter, clay materials, pH, hydrolytic acidity. Soil reaction is regarded to be one of the most important indicators of soil fertility. Soil reaction largely determines its physical, chemical and biological properties. Foundation acidity affects the structure firmness and the related water and air conditions.
   One of the methods of disposal of sewage sludge, which is based on its fertilizing properties, is its use in nature, e.g. in farming (if all the permissible standards are met). However, the sludge used for soil fertilization might also contain heavy metals which cause soil contamination and are accumulated in plants. The effect of application of organic fertilizers on soil reaction and other properties of sorption complex are also essential.
   The authors of the present study aimed at analysis of the effect of use of sewage sludge and selected organic fertilizers on changes in sorption properties in the fertilized soils. Sewage sludge was (for comparison purposes) was introduced to sandy soil. One of organic additions was also composted pine bark. The experiment was carried out under conditions of pot experiment. The following doses of organic fertilizers were used: 0, 10, 50, 100 and 200 Mg/ha (maximal reclamation dose according to current recommendations at the time of experiment) which were calculated per pot with 10 kg of sandy soil. After 1, 2 and 3 years from fertilization, changes in active and hydrolytic acidity were analysed in the fertilized foundations. The contents of organic matter, total of alkali in sorption complex S, soil sorption capacity T in fertilized soils was also determined.
   In summary of the Obtained results, one can conclude that the use of organic fertilizers, either manure or sewage sludge, considerably affects properties of sorption complex in fertilized soil. Organic fertilization improved soil properties. The total of exchangeable alkali and sorption complex capacity also increased. However, it was only manure used during the experiment that contributed to a reduction in the acidity of the fertilized soils in each case. It was found that the use of sewage sludge has significant effect on long-term phenomena of soil acidification. These mechanisms are confirmed by the obtained values of hydrolytic acidity.

AB  - Understanding how global change drivers and their interactions affect decomposition in wetlands embedded in agricultural landscapes remains challenging, especially in tropical and subtropical biomes, which are disproportionately important for global carbon cycling yet with high uncertainties. In a long-term whole-ecosystem experiment, we used a widely-adopted indicator of decomposition, the Teabag Index (TBI), to investigate individual and interactive effects of surrounding land-use intensity, cattle grazing, and prescribed fire on seasonal wetland decomposition (i.e., decay rate k, and stabilization factor S) in an exemplar subtropical landscape in central-south Florida, USA. We ask: (1) How do land-use intensity and management practices affect the decomposition in seasonal wetlands? (2) How does wetland decomposition vary with hydrological gradient and seasonal climatic condition? (3) What are the dominant direct and indirect pathways through which land-use intensity and management practices affect wetland decomposition? Our results showed that, overall, surrounding land-use intensity exerted much stronger effects on litter decomposition compared to grazing and prescribed fire, and cattle grazing reduced decomposition rate k. There was a complex three-way interaction among land-use intensity, grazing and fire on the stabilization factor S - a proxy related to carbon sequestration potential. Grazing-fire interactive effects on S only existed in wetlands embedded in intensively-managed landscapes, where grazing reduced S in burned wetlands but did not affect S in unburned wetlands. Decay rate k showed profound temporal variation primarily driven by seasonal climatic conditions (especially precipitation), whereas S varied spatially along the hydrological gradient. Our structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses further revealed that effects on k were also indirectly manifested through changes on soil C/N, C/P, and pH, while effects on S were manifested through alterations in soil C/P ratio, pH, soil nutrients and water content. Our TBI results suggest that anthropogenic environmental changes, including land-use intensification, livestock introduction and fire suppression, could compromise carbon sequestration potential in tropical and subtropical seasonal wetlands. Our research highlights the importance of considering landscape context in wetland management and demonstrates the use of TBI as an indicator to quantify and inform combinations of land management and agricultural practices could conserve wetlands and sustain their vital functions and services, especially from the lens of promoting carbon storage and nutrient retention services.

AB  - One mission of the Microbial Observatory Experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) is to examine the traits and diversity of fungal isolates to gain a better understanding of how fungi may adapt to microgravity environments and how this may affect interactions with humans in a closed habitat. Here, we report an initial characterization of two isolates, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, of Aspergillus fumigatus collected from the ISS and a comparison to the experimentally established clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10. Whole-genome sequencing of ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 showed 54,960 and 52,129 single nucleotide polymorphisms, respectively, compared to Af293, which is consistent with observed genetic heterogeneity among sequenced A. fumigatus isolates from diverse clinical and environmental sources. Assessment of in vitro growth characteristics, secondary metabolite production, and susceptibility to chemical stresses revealed no outstanding differences between ISS and clinical strains that would suggest special adaptation to life aboard the ISS. Virulence assessment in a neutrophil-deficient larval zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis revealed that both ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 were significantly more lethal than Af293 and CEA10. Taken together, these genomic, in vitro, and in vivo analyses of two A. fumigatus strains isolated from the ISS provide a benchmark for future investigations of these strains and for continuing research on specific microbial isolates from manned space environments.
   IMPORTANCE As durations of manned space missions increase, it is imperative to understand the long-term consequence of microbial exposure on human health in a closed human habitat. To date, studies aimed at bacterial and fungal contamination of space vessels have highlighted species compositions biased toward hardy, persistent organisms capable of withstanding harsh conditions. In the current study, we assessed traits of two independent Aspergillus fumigatus strains isolated from the International Space Station. Ubiquitously found in terrestrial soil and atmospheric environments, A. fumigatus is a significant opportunistic fungal threat to human health, particularly among the immunocompromised. Using two well-known clinical isolates of A. fumigatus as comparators, we found that both ISS isolates exhibited normal in vitro growth and chemical stress tolerance yet caused higher lethality in a vertebrate model of invasive disease. These findings substantiate the need for additional studies of physical traits and biological activities of microbes adapted to microgravity and other extreme extraterrestrial conditions.

AB  - The numbers of rotifers in large rivers never achieve the abundances observed in eutrophic lakes. The adverse conditions of the current have conduct biologists to establish links between particular geomorphologies and biological processes in the plankton of rivers. Recent attempts to examine specific adaptations of rotifers have shown that among several planktonic forms, the loricate species appeared to be better adapted to the current than soft-bodied or littoral-epibenthic species. The eutrophic Middle Loire provides rotifers with more edible biomass than that necessary for their production so, the aim of this study was to determine which other factors were responsible for the origins, growth and survival of rotifer populations in the river. Samples were taken bi-monthly in the current, from end-June to early-October during 8 years, in two sections of the River Loire situated at 550 and 640 kin from the source. Flow rate, temperature, dissolved oxygen, suspended matter, biological oxygen demand and algal densities were examined in parallel, and among the 61 rotifer species collected at each site, the 30 dominant species were retained for the analysis. Planktonic loricate species were dominant in the Middle Loire, followed by epibenthic species, soft-bodied species being least abundant. The densities of rotifers and algae changed in parallel and in relation to temperature; flow was clearly unfavourable to algae, represented by the Chlorophytes and to rotifers, whatever the sites. Co-inertia analysis revealed that the assemblage of species was closely grouped at Dam where the immediate environment was dominated by numerous scattered islands. This analysis also illustrated that the consequence of eutrophication in the water quality was more marked downstream. Lessons drawn from this experience of the Middle Loire, which ranks among the richest rivers in terms of species, allowed to highlight that dominance of the Brachionidae is a rule in numerous rivers and may be explained by the capacity of several species to continue growing in a current of 0.2 in s(-1). Trichocercids may be relevant indicators of sandy rivers. The flexibility of rotifers in the face of hydraulic conditions, the question of the rotifers' origin, the respective roles of downstream transfer and processes, as well as the role of the rotifers in the river food-web are discussed.

AB  - The aim of this study is to describe the environmental and climate changes that occurred in the mountains of Aubrac at the transition between the Lateglacial and the Holocene, from a comparative analysis of fossil Coleoptera and pollen, and a series of 23 C-14 dates. The changes affecting the ecological categories of Coleoptera lead to a division of the sequence into 5 beetle assemblage zones (BAZ): the lowermost BAZ A is characterized by extremely poor assemblages (periglacial environment); BAZ B (Oldest Dryas and Lateglacial Interstadial) is marked by regular occurrences of taxa associated with open environments, aquatic taxa associated with running and highly oxygenated water, and cold adapted taxa with relatively low numbers; BAZ C (Younger Dryas) corresponds to two important events: a particular abundance of cold adapted taxa and a marked decrease of running water taxa, beetles associated with herbaceous vegetation and open environments are also well represented; BAZ D (Early Holocene) corresponds to the total disappearance of cold adapted taxa; the transition BAZ C/BAZ D is marked also by a dramatic peak of running water taxa; the uppermost BAZ E (Early/Mid Holocene) is marked by a total absence of running water taxa which are replaced by standing water or taxa tolerant of a range of water conditions, a particular abundance of wetland taxa, and taxa associated with herbaceous vegetation and open environments. Beetle and pollen data suggest that the harsh climatic conditions prevailing in the Aubrac mountains did not allow warm dependent fauna and trees to establish during the Lateglacial Interstadial, at least in the Roustieres region, and that wide open landscapes occupied the plateau at that time. The Older Dryas, a cold spell previously recorded at La Taphanel (Cantal), is not visible in the Roustieres record, probably because of the higher altitude at Roustieres, whereas the Younger Dryas is strongly expressed. During the Holocene, concordant beetles and pollen data enable to reconstruct the rapid recolonization of the plateau by mesophilous trees (Ulmus, Quercus), suggesting the possible presence of refugia to the southern slopes of the Aubrac plateau. Insect/pollen comparisons provide evidence for hydrological changes in the former lake of Roustieres and suggest that lacustrine water level changes often used as indicator of precipitation regime changes should be taken with caution.

AB  - In many regions of Central Europe, semi-natural grasslands have experienced severe vegetation changes, e.g. compositional change and overall species loss, because of land use changes, atmospheric nitrogen input and also climate change. Here we analysed the vegetation change in a dry grassland complex (Gabower Hange) in the Biosphere Reserve Schorfheide-Chorin (NE Brandenburg, Germany), one of the driest regions of the country. We resampled four 10 m(2) plots of each of four typical alliances (Festucion valesiacae, Koelerion glaucae, Armerion elongatae, Arrhenatherion elatioris) about 20 years after their original sampling with a recovery accuracy of approx. 10 m. The cover of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens was recorded in both samplings. The overall compositional change was analysed with a detrended correpondence analysis (DCA). To interpret this change, we calculated unweighted mean Ellenberg indicator values for old and new plots.. Furthermore we tested differences in constancy of individual species between old and new plots as well as differences in species richness, cover of herb and cryptogam layer, ecological indicator values and unweighted proportion of species groups (vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens), floristic status (native or not), life forms, CSR-strategy types and Red List species. The results of the ordination indicated no significant vegetation change, but revealed tendencies towards more nutrient-rich conditions. Ellenberg indicator values for nutrients and soil reaction were significantly correlated with the axes of the ordination. There were 28 species exclusively found in the new plots and 45 species of the old plots missing. While no species decreased significantly, there were seven species that increased significantly. Mean species richness was significantly increased in the new plots. There were no significant differences in mean Ellenberg indicator values. Proportions of vascular plants, neophytes, hemicryptophytes and CS-strategists decreased. We conclude that overall vegetation changes are small, indicating that the dry grassland complex at the Gabower Range is still in a good state and of high conservation value. This relative stability over time compared to the situation in many other dry grasslands throughout temperate Europe is likely attributable to low nitrogen deposition and the dryness of the local climate. However, the detected tendency towards more nutrient-rich conditions should be taken into account in future management.

AB  - Many biogeochemical anomalies coincide with the Late Permian Extinction (LPE; 252.28 Ma). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the moretane/hopane anomaly that has been identified in samples from Meishan GSSP section in southeastern China. Here, we report homohopane, 2 alpha- and 3 beta-methylhomohopane and lithological data for a drill core from the Meishan section in southeastern China. Three intervals of elevated C-30 moretane/hopane ratios are recorded in the Lungtan, Yinkeng and Helongshan Formations. Moretane/hopane ratios of C31-34 homohopanes and the 2 alpha- and 3 beta-methylhomohopanes display the same stratigraphic patterns as the C-30 moretane/hopane record. In light of the multiple and parallel moretane anomalies for the homohopane and 2 alpha- and 3 beta-methylhomohopane series, enhanced input from higher plant organic matter, such as coal and peat, does not adequately explain the observed isomer patterns. Correlation of high moretane/hopane ratios with low C-35 Homohopane Index (HHI) and high hopane/sterane values suggest increased input of hopanoids from oxic soils. Additionally, moretane/hopane ratios show excellent correlations with total clay percentages and specific clay types, particularly chlorite, illite, and mixed layer illite/smectite. We conclude that a combination of episodic hopanoid input from soil bacteria and diagenetic effects related to redox and detrital clays generated the unique moretane/hopane patterns at Meishan.
   Similar relationships of Ts/(Ts + Tm) with redox, source indicators, and lithology indicate that Ts/(Ts + Tm) is affected by the same factors controlling the moretane/hopane ratios. Berthierine, a clay that requires reducing conditions for formation, was detected in samples from the Lungtan Formation. We are unable to determine from our results whether the berthierine is authigenic or detrital, but future determination of the origin of berthierine at Meishan may offer additional environmental insight. No link between diasteranes and lithology was observed in this study suggesting that diasteranes are relatively unaffected by the detrital clay component of the Meishan sediments. In total, the results point toward the complex role of source input, lithology, and depositional redox conditions in the transformation of organic matter during maturation. Future work is required to elucidate the lithological effects on diagenetic processes, including biomarker genesis isomerization, and thermal degradation. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The efficiency of water use and transport are among the main factors affecting competitiveness, growth, and distribution of trees under warming climate. The phenotypical and genetic plasticity of tree populations is considered as an indicator of their adaptive capacity under changing environment. Climatic changes are expected to affect growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and selection of reproductive material among the populations suitable for future climates has been advised for sustaining productivity of stands. In this regard, provenance trials can serve as source of comprehensive information about growth plasticity and climate-growth interactions of diverse populations. Quantitative wood anatomy can provide detailed information about xylogenesis and factors affecting it, which are crucial for long-term predictions. Wood anatomy of two top- (Gustrow and Rytel), two low-performing (Eibenstock and Dippoldiswalde), and one local (Kalsnava) provenances of Scots pine from the eastern Baltic region growing in three provenance trials in Latvia was studied using mixed models, accounting for the experimental design, as well as using the time-series approach. Provenance had a significant effect on the studied wood anatomical proxies, indicating genetic adaptation of xylogenesis. The top-performing provenances, which originated from warmer and drier conditions, had tracheids with larger lumens and thinner walls, thus indicating adaptation to water deficit. The top-performing Rytel provenance showed the highest phenotypical plasticity of lumen cross-section area and cell wall thickness of stemwood tracheids. The studied low-performing provenances, which originated from the Orr Mountains, had tracheids with thicker wall and smaller lumens, likely to ensure mechanical durability. The local provenance showed intermediate values of the studied wood anatomical proxies. The effect of provenance on wood anatomical proxies showed some variations among the trials, which differed by continentality, likely due to ecological transfer distance. The studied anatomical proxies were affected by weather conditions prior and during formation of a tree ring, yet these relationships differed by trial and provenance. In general, wood anatomy of earlywood was affected by temperature in the dormant period and beginning of summer, as well as precipitation in the end of the previous vegetation period. Proxies of latewood showed correlation with temperature (negative) and precipitation (positive) in summer, suggesting response to the availability of water. Considering the observed relationships, the top-performing provenances, particularly Rytel, have a high potential to sustain productivity of stands within the region in the future.

AB  - Species-based ecological indices, such as Ellenberg indicators, reflect plant habitat preferences and can be used to describe local environment conditions. One disadvantage of using vegetation data as a substitute for environmental data is the fact that extensive floristic sampling can usually only be carried out at a plot scale within limited geographical areas. Remotely sensed data have the potential to provide information on fine-scale vegetation properties over large areas. In the present study, we examine whether airborne hyperspectral remote sensing can be used to predict Ellenberg nutrient (N) and moisture (M) values in plots in dry grazed grasslands within a local agricultural landscape in southern Sweden. We compare the prediction accuracy of three categories of model: (I) models based on predefined vegetation indices (VIs), (II) models based on waveband-selected VIs, and (III) models based on the full set of hyperspectral wavebands. We also identify the optimal combination of wavebands for the prediction of Ellenberg values. The floristic composition of 104 (4 m x 4 m grassland) plots on the Baltic island of Ol and was surveyed in the field, and the vascular plant species recorded in the plots were assigned Ellenberg indicator values for N and M. A community-weighted mean value was calculated for N (mN) and M (mM) within each plot. Hyperspectral data were extracted from an 8 m x 8 m pixel window centred on each plot. The relationship between field-observed and predicted mean Ellenberg values was significant for all three categories of prediction models. The performance of the category II and III models was comparable, and they gave lower prediction errors and higher R-2 values than the category I models for both mN and mM. Visible and near-infrared wavebands were important for the prediction of both mN and mM, and shortwave infrared wavebands were also important for the prediction of mM. We conclude that airborne hyperspectral remote sensing can detect spectral differences in vegetation between grassland plots characterised by different mean Ellenberg N and M values, and that remote sensing technology can potentially be used to survey fine-scale variation in environmental conditions within a local agricultural landscape.

AB  - Acid gas absorption using amine solution is a common method for large-scale acid gas separation, although this separation technique suffers from high energy requirements. In this study, the amine-based acid gas removal (AGR) unit aims for operation enhancement. The new amine mixture, a combination of MDEA-DEA-PZ, is used to remove acid gas components from natural gas. As energy consumption is of high importance for both the industry and community, a systematic exergoeconomic optimization and a sensitivity analysis are performed to avoid production loss and enhance the AGR unit's energy efficiency. An exergy assessment is performed to determine the irreversibility and exergy efficiency of the AGR equipment. The stripper and absorber columns show the largest exergy destruction, that is 8.48 and 7.93 MW, respectively; almost 80% of the entire exergy destruction belongs to the stripper and absorber. The exergoeconomic parameters, such as relative cost difference, exergoeconomic factor, and most importantly, the exergy destruction cost, are determined for the key equipment of the AGR unit. The stripper accounts for the largest exergy destruction cost (0.5260 $/s), followed by the absorber (0.2950 $/s). The Taguchi approach is employed to conduct a proper sensitivity analysis and to determine the optimal operation state with the lowest total exergy destruction cost. Five key parameters, induding stripper pressure, lean amine loading, lean amine temperature, lean amine concentration, and PZ concentration, are selected for the optimization phase. It is concluded that the stripper pressure and lean amine loading (with 28 and 25% relative significance, respectively) are the key factors with the largest shares in the total exergy destruction value. The optimal operation state obtained by the Taguchi method shows a remarkable reduction in the exergy destruction cost (19.32%) and steam consumption (23.88%). According to the environmental assessment, CO2 emissions mitigate from 118.88 to 90.49 t/d while operating the process at the optimal conditions. In addition, the carbon tax is reduced to almost 23% at the optimal condition, and the steam cost declines from 3.77 x 10(6) to 2.87 x 10(6) USD/year. This study further highlights the importance of exergoeconomic assessment as a useful strategy for determining the irreversibility costs in energy and chemical sectors.

AB  - The technology currently available for quantifying various biometric, behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and psychological aspects of daily life has become increasingly diverse, accurate, and accessible as a result of ongoing and continuous improvements. These burgeoning technologies can and will profoundly alter the way lifestyle, health, wellness, and chronic diseases are managed in the future. For those pursuing the potential of such digital technologies in the creation of a compelling and effective connected healthcare experience, a number of new concepts have surfaced. We have taken these concepts (many of which originate in engineering) and extended them so they can be incorporated into managing health risk and health conditions via a blended digital health experience. For example, the advent of mobile technology for health has given rise to concepts, such as ecological momentary assessment and ecological momentary intervention that assess the person's (digital twin) status and delivers interventions as needed, when needed-perhaps even preemptively. For such concepts to be fully realized, the experience design of mobile health (mHealth) program(s) (aka connected care) should and now can actually guide end users through a series of self-experiments directed by data-driven feedback from a version of their digital twin. As treatment development and testing move toward the precision of individual differences inherent in every person and every treatment response (or non-response), group data and more recent big data approaches for generating new knowledge offer limited help to end users (including practitioners) for helping individuals evaluate their own digital twin-generated data and change over time under different conditions. This is the renaissance of N-of-1 or individual science. N-of-1 evaluation creates the opportunity to evaluate each individual uniquely. The rigor and logic of N-of-1 designs have been well articulated and expanded upon for over a half century. For the clinician, this revitalized form of scientific and behavioral interaction evaluation can help validate or reject the impact a given treatment has for a given patient with increased efficiency and accuracy. Further, N-of-1 can incorporate biological (genomic), behavioral, psychological, and digital health data such that users themselves can begin to evaluate the relationships of their own treatment response patterns and the contingencies that impact them. Thus, emerges the self-scientist.

AB  - Due to harsh climatic conditions, a limited number of tree species, and a predominantly single-story structure, subalpine forests are characterized by low faunal diversity. While the habitats of species associated with this altitudinal zone are strongly modified by abiotic and biotic factors, the forest management procedures implemented in the aftermath of disturbances typically focus on sanitary hazards and economic losses rather than benefits to biodiversity.
   The study involved three areas in different stages of forest development resulting from natural disturbances: mature (closed undisturbed stands), break-up (stands with ongoing break-up processes), and growing-up (stands with advanced post-disturbance regeneration). Forest structural indicators for each stage were evaluated on sample plots. A bird census was conducted during breeding and non-breeding seasons to determine species composition, density, and ecological groups (nesting guilds). Actual species diversity, the maximum Shannon-Wiener diversity index, and the evenness index were calculated for each forest development stage. Finally, similarly indices were computed to compare the various stages in terms of bird species.
   The processes of stand mortally, deadwood accumulation, and regeneration initiation were the driving forces for the development of new habitat conditions with a substantial expansion of potential nesting and foraging sites and shelters. The forest structural indicators were greatly varied. The mature stage revealed the highest density of breeding bird pairs, but the species composition was simplified, with the lowest evenness indicator. The largest number of nesting bird species was found in the break-up stage. During the non-breeding season, the break-up stage was not preferred by birds; the greatest number of species was observed in the growing-up stage, and the highest density in the mature stage. The bird species composition and similarly indices showed substantial differences between the various stages of forest development.
   Given the continuity of forest development processes and the related changes, it appears that the various development stages should not be viewed as more or less desirable than others from a conservation perspective. The findings show benefits to biodiversity brought about by disturbances in subalpine forests and the importance of each stage. Thus, management practices should be modified to better focus on the protection of the microsites created by disturbances, which are sparse in undisturbed stands.

AB  - The strategic relevance of waste prevention has considerably increased worldwide during recent years, such that the current European legislation requires the preparation of national waste prevention programmes in which reduction objectives and measures are identified. In such a context, it is possible to recognise how, in order to correctly evaluate the environmental consequences of a prevention activity, a life cycle perspective should be employed. This allows us to go beyond the simple reduction of the generated waste which, alone, does not automatically imply achieving better overall environmental performance, especially when this reduction is not pursued through the simple reduction of consumption.
   In this study, the energetic and environmental performance of two waste prevention activities considered particularly meaningful for the Italian context were evaluated using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The two activities were the utilisation of public network water (two scenarios) and of refillable bottled water (two scenarios) for drinking purposes, instead of one-way bottled water (three scenarios).
   The energy demand and specific potential impacts of the four waste prevention scenarios and of the three baseline scenarios were compared with the aim of evaluating whether, and under what conditions, the analysed prevention activities are actually associated with overall energetic and environmental benefits.
   In typical conditions, the use of public network water directly from the tap results in the best scenario, while if water is withdrawn from public fountains, its further transportation by private car can involve significant impacts. The use of refillable PET bottled water seems the preferable scenario for packaged water consumption, if refillable bottles are transported to local distributors along the same (or a lower) distance as one-way bottles to retailers. The use of refillable glass bottled water is preferable to one-way bottled water only if a distance beneath 150 km separates bottling plants from local distributors and retailers (except for eutrophication indicator which is always slightly worse).
   To reduce waste generation and to achieve meaningful potential savings of natural resources, energy and greenhouse gas emissions, a reduction in one-way bottled water consumption in Italy is recommended in favour of the use of public network water and of the establishment of short distance-PET bottles based refilling systems. The development of closed loop recycling of one-way PET bottles, and especially the reduction of the distance along which one-way bottled water is transported, are also important.

AB  - The interactions of genetically modified (GM) crops with soil species and ecosystems is complex, requiring both specific and broad spectrum assessments. In the ECOGEN project we undertook experiments at three scales of increasing complexity, using Bt maize expressing the Cry1Ab protein from Bacillus thuringiensis as an example. Test species were selected for laboratory-scale experiments to represent taxonomic groups that we could also monitor at glasshouse and field scales (e.g., nematodes, protozoa, micro-arthropods, earthworms, and snails). In the laboratory, single species were exposed to purified Cry1Ab protein or to Bt maize leaf powder incorporated into simplified diets under controlled conditions. In the glasshouse, multiple test species and soil microbial. communities taken from ECOGEN's field sites were exposed to Bt maize plants growing under glasshouse or mesocosm conditions. In the field, evaluations were conducted on our selected indicator groups over multiple sites and growing seasons. Field evaluation included assessment of effects due to the local environment, crop type, seasonal variation and conventional crop management practice (tillage and pesticide use), which cannot be assessed in the glasshouse. No direct effects of Cry1Ab protein or Bt leaf residues were detected on our laboratory test organisms, but some significant effects were detected in the glasshouse. Total nematode and protozoan numbers increased in field soil under Bt maize relative to conventional maize, whilst microbial community structure and activity were unaffected. Field results for the abundance of nematodes and protozoa showed some negative effects of Bt maize, thus contradicting the glasshouse results. However, these negative results were specific to particular field sites and sampling times and therefore were transient. Taking the overall variation found in maize ecosystems at different sites into account, any negative effects of Bt maize at field scale were judged to be indirect and no greater than the impacts of crop type, tillage and pesticide use. Although the ECOGEN results were not predictive between the three experimental scales, we propose that they have value when used with feedback loops between the scales. This holistic approach can used to address questions raised by results from any level of experimentation and also for putting GM crop risk:benefit into context with current agricultural practices in regionally differing agro-ecosystems.

AB  - Background Soil bacteria are a major source of specialized metabolites including antimicrobial compounds. Yet, one of the most diverse genera of bacteria ubiquitously present in soil, Clostridium, has been largely overlooked in bioactive compound discovery. As Clostridium spp. thrive in extreme environments with their metabolic mechanisms adapted to the harsh conditions, they are likely to synthesize molecules with unknown structures, properties, and functions. Therefore, their potential to synthesize small molecules with biological activities should be of great interest in the search for novel antimicrobial compounds. The current study focused on investigating the antimicrobial potential of four soil Clostridium isolates, FS01, FS2.2 FS03, and FS04, using a genome-led approach, validated by culture-based methods. Results Conditioned/spent media from all four Clostridium isolates showed varying levels of antimicrobial activity against indicator microorganism; all four isolates significantly inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. FS01, FS2.2, and FS04 were active against Bacillus mycoides and FS03 reduced the growth of Bacillus cereus. Phylogenetic analysis together with DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH), average nucleotide identity (ANI), and functional genome distribution (FGD) analyses confirmed that FS01, FS2.2, and FS04 belong to the species Paraclostridium bifermentans, Clostridium cadaveris, and Clostridium senegalense respectively, while FS03 may represent a novel species of the genus Clostridium. Bioinformatics analysis using antiSMASH 5.0 predicted the presence of eight biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding for the synthesis of ribosomally synthesized post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) in four genomes. All predicted BGCs showed no similarity with any known BGCs suggesting novelty of the molecules from those predicted gene clusters. In addition, the analysis of genomes for putative virulence factors revealed the presence of four putative Clostridium toxin related genes in FS01 and FS2.2 genomes. No genes associated with the main Clostridium toxins were identified in the FS03 and FS04 genomes. Conclusions The presence of BGCs encoding for uncharacterized RiPPs and NRPSs in the genomes of antagonistic Clostridium spp. isolated from farm soil indicated their potential to produce novel secondary metabolites. This study serves as a basis for the identification and characterization of potent antimicrobials from these soil Clostridium spp. and expands the current knowledge base, encouraging future research into bioactive compound production in members of the genus Clostridium.

AB  - River water that receives treated wastewater can be contaminated by pathogens including enteric viruses due to fecal pollution, which may represent an important public health hazard. There is a great diversity of enteric viruses and fecal bacteriophages, especially F-specific RNA bacteriophages (FRNAPHs), are commonly proposed as indicators of viral pollution due to a variety of characteristics such as their structural similarities to the main enteric viruses, their high concentrations in raw wastewater and their environmental survival rate, which is better than other cultivable enteric viruses. However, evaluating the viral contamination of water on the basis of FRNAPH concentration levels continues to present a challenge. This is because the quality of detection is strongly dependent on the quantity of viral particles, high spatio-temporal variabilities and the physico-chemical conditions of the water during sampling. To overcome these limitations, the present study aims to evaluate whether the bivalve mollusk Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussel) could be considered a suitable experimental model for assessing the viral contamination of rivers. In order to determine this, the capacity of D. polymorpha to accumulate FRNAPHs and assimilate them into their soft tissue was studied. This provided a proof of concept for the use of D. polymorpha to evaluate the viral contamination of surface water. Two experiments were conducted: (1) an in situ experiment to confirm that zebra mussels naturally accumulated FRNAPHs and (2) a laboratory experiment to determine the accumulation and depuration kinetics of FRNAPHs in D. polymorpha tissue. The study highlights the capacity of the mussels to accumulate infectious FRNAPHs both on a laboratory scale under controlled conditions as well as in situ at different sites that are representative of different bodies of water. An analysis of the mussels' soft tissue showed that they were capable of reflecting the water's contamination level very quickly (within less than 24 h). Moreover, the soft tissue retained the viral load much longer than the water due to a low depuration rate. The analysis of FRNAPH concentrations in mussels exposed in situ suggested that there were differences in contamination levels between sites. These preliminary results underline the potential utility of zebra mussels in assessing viral contamination by measuring the accumulation of FRNAPHs in their tissue. This may ultimately enable stakeholders to use zebra mussels as a means of monitoring viral pollution in surface water.

AB  - The majority of deforested land in the Amazon Basin has become cattle pasture, making forest-to-pasture conversion an important contributor to the carbon (C) and climate dynamics of the region. However, our understanding of biogeochemical dynamics in pasturelands remains poor, especially when attempting to scale up predictions of C cycle changes. A wide range of pasture ages, soil types, management strategies, and climates make remote sensing the only realistic means to regionalize our understanding of pasture biogeochemistry and C cycling over such an enormous geographic area. However, the use of remote sensing has been impeded by a lack of effective links between variables that can be observed from satellites (e.g. live and senescent biomass) and variables that cannot be observed, but which may drive key changes in C storage and trace gas fluxes (e.g. soil nutrient status). We studied patterns in canopy biophysical-biochemical properties and soil biogeochemical processes along pasture age gradients on two important soil types in the central Amazon. Our goals were to (1) improve our understanding of the plot-scale biogeochemical dynamics of this land-use change, (2) evaluate the effects of pasture development on two contrasting soil types (clayey Oxisols and sandy Entisols), and (3) attempt to use remotely sensed variables to scale up the site-specific variability in biogeochemical conditions of pasturelands.
   The biogeochemical analyses showed that (1) aboveground and soil C stocks decreased with pasture age on both clayey and sandy soils, (2) declines in plant biomass were well correlated with declines in soil C and with available phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca), and (3) despite low initial values for total and available soil P, ecosystem P stocks declined further with pasture age, as did a number of other nutrients. Spectral mixture analysis of Landsat imagery provided estimates of photosynthetic vegetation (PV) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) that were highly correlated with field measurements of these variables and plant biomass. In turn, the remotely sensed sum PV+NPV was well correlated with the changes in soil organic carbon and nitrogen, and available P and Ca. These results suggest that remote sensing can be an excellent indicator of not only pasture area, but of pasture condition and C storage, thereby greatly improving regional estimates of the environmental consequences of such land-use change.

AB  - Wildfires are important in modern ecology but the complex interplay between wildfires and vegetation or climate is less well understood in ancient environments, in particular those of the Arctic regions. This includes the impacts of paleo-wildfires on surrounding marine basins by affecting sedimentation rates and nutrient input via soil degeneration and intensification of continental run-off. The Late Cretaceous was an important time of global climate shift, with the rise of angiosperm vegetation marking a turning point in global flora, and globally abundant wildfires due to high atmospheric oxygen levels and elevated temperatures. This study investigates Late Cretaceous samples from the Canadian Arctic Islands to examine the evidence for widespread wildfires and how these wildfires may have influenced or been influenced by contemporaneous climate and vegetation shifts. Organic geochemical, and organic petrological data show evidence of enhanced wildfires beginning in the Turonian, including increases in semi-fusinite macerals and pyrogenic PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) indicators of natural combustion. This increasing wildfire influence corresponds with a rise in broad-leafed Arctic forests, as evidenced by angiosperm-derived terpenoid biomarkers, with both wildfire and angiosperm abundances peaking in the Early Campanian. Additionally, geochemical and petrographic data shows a shift in the type of organic matter deposited over time, correlating to the evidence of increased wildfire activity. This study proposes that the distance between wildfire region and marine depocenter is assessed via a new provenance method based on the degree of photo-oxic degradation of selected PAH isomers upon airborne transport. The increasing effects of wildfires on the Arctic ecosystem over the Turonian-Campanian were likely driven by relatively warm temperatures, elevated atmospheric oxygen, volcanism related to the High Arctic Large Igneous Province (HALIP), and abundant fuel availability. Widespread wildfires are proposed to have fostered the expansion of angiosperm vegetation into the Canadian Arctic in the Late Cretaceous by allowing them to outcompete gymnosperms in post-fire regrowth. Intensified erosion and continental run-off associated with the destruction of the vegetation cover by wildfires is thought to have acted as a driving force in the increasing terrigenous organic matter deposition in the Sverdrup Basin during the Late Cretaceous. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that increasing wildfires related to global climatic conditions in the Late Cretaceous contributed to the expansion of angiosperm flora in the Arctic, and had a substantial impact on the deposition of sediments in the surrounding Sverdrup Basin.

AB  - For a sustainable future, we must sustainably manage not only the human/industrial system but also ecosystems. To achieve the latter goal, we need to predict the responses of ecosystems and their provided services to management practices under changing environmental conditions via ecosystem models and use tools to compare the estimated provided services between the different scenarios. However, scientific articles have covered a limited amount of estimated ecosystem services and have used tools to aggregate services that contain a significant amount of subjective aspects and that represent the final result in a non-tangible unit such as 'points'. To resolve these matters, this study quantifies the environmental impact (on human health, natural systems and natural resources) in physical units and uses an ecosystem service valuation based on monetary values (including ecosystem disservices with associated negative monetary values). More specifically, the paper also focuses on the assessment of ecosystem services related to pollutant removal/generation flows, accounting for the inflow of eutrophying nitrogen (N) when assessing the effect of N leached to groundwater. Regarding water use/provisioning, evapotranspiration is alternatively considered a disservice because it implies a loss of (potential) groundwater. These approaches and improvements, relevant to all ecosystems, are demonstrated using a Scots pine stand from 2010 to 2089 for a combination of three environmental change and three management scenarios. The environmental change scenarios considered interannual climate variability trends and included alterations in temperature, precipitation, nitrogen deposition, wind speed, Particulate matter (PM) concentration and CO2 concentration.
   The addressed flows/ecosystem services, including disservices, are as follows: particulate matter removal, freshwater loss, CO2 sequestration, wood production, NOx emissions, NH3 uptake and nitrogen pollution/removal.
   The monetary ecosystem service valuation yields a total average estimate of 361-1242 euro ha(-1) yr(-1). PM2.5 (<2.5 mu mu m) removal is the key service, with a projected value of 622-1172 euro ha(-1) yr(-1). Concerning environmental impact assessment, with net CO2 uptake being the most relevant contributing flow, a loss prevention of 0.014-0.029 healthy life years ha(-1) yr(-1) is calculated for the respective flows. Both assessment methods favor the use of the least intensive management scenario due to its resulting higher CO2 sequestration and PM removal, which are the most important services of the considered ones.

AB  - Pollen analysis of the pre-Last Glacial Maximum succession of a 105 m-long continuous core from Tirrenia (Tuscany) provides evidence for the existence of an area of relatively high ecological stability where the effects of climate change were mitigated. The chronological framework of the vegetation record, spanning the Last Interglacial-Glacial cycle, was established by (i) AMS (14)C dating, (ii) correlation with well-dated pollen sequences, and (iii) local stratigraphical constraints. A high lithological and sedimentological variability, with facies associations changing from fluvial to alluvial and coastal plain, enhances the palaeoenvironmental control on pollen distribution, thus helping to discriminate the impact of local factors on vegetation history. The most remarkable evidence, however, is represented by the continuous record of temperate trees throughout the whole glacial period, which provides useful indications on the location and nature of cold stage refugia. Most of the vegetation changes recorded in the core can be compared to the vegetation history of the Last Interglacial-Glacial cycle from southern Europe as a whole. In addition, local geographic and environmental features account for a more complex and varied floristic composition. Only the last phase of the Penultimate Glacial (MIS6), which was characterized by the diffusion of an and steppe tundra, is recorded at the base of the core. The subsequent Last Interglacial (MIS5e) interval shows a poor and scattered pollen content due to the instability of the sedimentary environment. Nevertheless, it provides evidence of both global and local controls on vegetation dynamics, as indicated by the initial expansion of thermophilous forests and the remarkably late diffusion of conifers (Pinus-Abies-Picea forests), respectively. Similarly, the transition to the Last Glacial (MIS5b and 5a in the core) is characterized by a reduced vegetation response to the typical stadial/interstadial climate variability. This is because the diffusion of a characteristic pioneer vegetation (mainly represented by Hippophae cf. rhamnoides) helped to confer to the local environment a high ecological stability, buffering vegetation changes. Finally, during the Last Glacial, mixed broad-leaved deciduous and Pinus forests widely occupied the Arno coastal plain, demonstrating that this area acted as an important tree refuge. Local ecological conditions favourable to tree survival were determined mainly by (i) high precipitation, as a function of orographic uplift of air charged with moisture from the nearby Tyrrhenian Sea, (ii) mild temperatures, which were also influenced by proximity to the sea, and (iii) high topographic variability, providing a series of suitable microenvironments.

AB  - The article is devoted to the study of the life potential support of the population, which reflects living conditions of the population in specific geosystems (on the example of the Sumy region, Ukraine). The main purpose of the article is to assess the geo-ecological potential of the regional landscape structures, namely the landscape districts of the Sumy region. The article highlights the theoretical and methodological foundations of the geo-ecological potential research, substantiates the theoretical aspects of the of "geo-ecological potential" concept, describes in detail the methodology of assessing geo-ecological potential, which is evaluated on the basis of natural geosystem potential, geosystem sustainability potential and technogenic geosystem load. The assessment of the natural potential of the Sumy region landscape districts (based on the humidity coefficient, the sum of active temperatures above 10 degrees C, hydrothermal potential of phytomass productivity, annual precipitation, adverse natural processes such as landslides, flooding, rising groundwater levels, erosion, dry winds, hail, fogs) is conducted and the levels (low, below average, average and high) of the natural potential are defined. Three districts of the environmental sustainability of the regional landscape districts are established on the basis of component-by-component assessment of the meteorological potential of the atmosphere, surface water and soil sustainability potential, as well as biotic potential: below average, average and above average. The indicators of the population density of the region, coefficient of the territorial production concentration, economic development of lands (agricultural lands, built-up lands and open lands without vegetation), environmental pollution of the region (radiation and chemical air pollution, pollution of natural waters and soils) and the integrated indicator of technogenic load, which allows to establish the following levels of the technogenic load on the landscape districts of the region: below average, average and above average, are analyzed. Particular attention is paid to the assessment of the geo-ecological potential, which allows to establish 5 levels, of which only 3 are presented in Sumy region, based on which areas of geo-ecological potential of the landscape districts are identified: below average, average and above average and a map of the geo-ecological potential areas is created. It is established that the indicator of the geo-ecological potential of the landscape districts of the Sumy region ranges from 0.05 Psel-Vorskla landscape district (below average level) to 1.07 Esman'-Kleven' landscape district (above average level). It is established that the higher the values of the natural potential and sustainability of the natural environment and the lower the indicators of technogenic load, the higher are the values of the geo-ecological potential.

Their assessment, including drivers, has a high concern for society. Likewise, species association with ecosystems in the landscape (as different forest types, grasslands and peatlands) are unknown for some taxa and regions, and could explain species flow into harvested areas. Therefore, we evaluated the forest harvest impact on ground-dwelling spiders and vascular plants, their diversity and association to vegetation types in the landscape matrix, and richness and abundance correlations with forest structure. Six natural common habitats were studied in Tierra del Fuego (Argentina), where variable retention has been implemented: aggregated (AR) and dispersed (DR) retention in harvested Nothofagus pumilio forests, unharvested primary forests (NPF) as reference, grasslands (G), peatlands (P), and unharvested N. antarctica forests (NAF). We surveyed spiders (N = 432, by 6 habitats x 6 replicates x 6 collections x 2 years), and vascular plants (N = 36, by 6 habitats x 6 replicates), and characterized forest structure in wooded ecosystems. We determined for both taxa richness, relative abundance (total captures/ground cover) and Shannon-Wiener and Pielou indices, compared assemblage composition and indicator species among harvesting treatments and vegetation types, and analyzed correlations. We sampled 752 individuals of spiders from 33 species (six families), and 79 vascular plant species (28 families) that averaged 52% total vegetation cover. Total spider captures and overall richness were higher in DR > NPF > AR, although differences were not detected at plot level for any variable. For understory vascular plants, richness and cover were the highest on DR, followed by AR and NPF, as well as at plot level, with no affectation in indices. Likewise, highest richness and abundance occurred in NAF and NPF for spiders, and in NAF and G for vascular plants, with unique assemblages in each vegetation type despite the shared species. Assemblages also differed in harvested areas, including species of other vegetation types mainly in DR, where new conditions were generated by reduction of forest structure variables (evidenced by negative correlations), while AR maintained species composition similar to NPF, contributing to the conservation of forest specialists. Indicators occurred for both taxa in several habitats. This study highlights the importance of different vegetation types for spider and plant conservation at landscape level, while provides tools for developing monitoring strategies and conservation policies.

AB  - 1. During late spring 1993-1995, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) sampled 490 wadeable streams in the mid-Atlantic Highlands (MAH) of the U.S. for a variety of physical, chemical and biological indicators of environmental condition. We used the resulting data set to evaluate the importance of differing levels of macroinvertebrate taxonomic resolution in bioassessments by comparing the ability of family versus genus to detect differences among sites classified by type and magnitude of human impact and by stream size. We divided the MAH into two physiographic regions: the Appalachian Plateau where mine drainage (MD) and acidic deposition are major stressors, and the Ridge and Valley where nutrient enrichment is a major stressor. Stream sites were classified into three or four impact classes based on water chemistry and habitat. We used stream order (first to third Strahler order) in each region as a measure of stream size. Ordination, 2 x 2 chi-square and biotic metrics were used to compare the ability of family and genus to detect differences among both stressor and size classes.
   2. With one notable exception, there were only a small number of different genera per family (interquartile range = 1-4). Family Chironomidae, however, contained 123 different genera. As a result, significant information loss occurred when this group was only classified to family. The family Chironomidae did not discriminate among the predefined classes but many chironomid genera did: by chi-square analysis, 10 and 28 chironomid genera were significant in discriminating MD and nutrient impacts, respectively.
   3. Family and genus data were similar in their ability to distinguish among the coarse impacts (e.g. most severe versus least severe impact classes) for all cases. Though genus data in many cases distinguished the subtler differences (e.g. mixed/moderate impacts versus high or low impacts) better than family, differences in significance levels between family and genus analyses were relatively minor. However, genus data detected differences among stream orders in ordination analyses that were not revealed at the family level. In the ordinations, both family and genus levels of analysis responded to similar suites of environmental variables.
   4. Our results suggest that identification to the family level is sufficient for many bioassessment purposes. However, identifications to genus do provide more information in genera-rich families like Chironomidae. Genus or finer levels of identification are important for investigating natural history, stream ecology, biodiversity and indicator species. Decisions about the taxonomic level of identification need to be study specific and depend on available resources (cost) and study objectives.

AB  - Understanding the characteristics of water use efficiency (WUE) and its controlling factors in the agricultural ecosystem can help us better understand the coupled process between water use and carbon assimilation spatially. The characteristics of the leaf- and ecosystem-level water, carbon and WUE variations as well as their drivers in a kiwifruit orchard were systematically analyzed during the growing seasons of 2018-2020. The results showed that leaf transpiration rate (T-r), net photosynthetic rate (P-n) and instantaneous WUE (WUEi) in exposed leaves were 2.25-2.77, 8.32-9.44 and 2.53-3.77 times higher than those of shaded leaves. T-r and P-n were significantly affected by photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and stomatal conductance (g(s)). Air temperature (T-a), leaf water vapor deficit (VPDl) and stomatal conductance (g(s)) affected WUEi through leaf water consumption, while PAR affected WUEi through leaf photosynthetic process. Averaged evapotranspiration (ET), gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem WUE (eWUE) were 551.30 +/- 75.92 kg H2O m(-2), 1475.37.59 +/- 201.25 g C m(-2) and 2.68 +/- 0.04 g C kg(-1) H2O, respectively. Global total radiation (R-g), T-a and VPD were the dominant climatic factors affecting ET and GPP, while R-g and wind speed (U-2) were significantly correlated with eWUE (p < 0.01). WUEu, defined as the ratio of P-n center dot VPD10.5 a(n)d T-r, could be considered as an effective indicator quantifying the coupled relationship between T-r and P-n center dot VPD10.5 at the (1)eaf scale. The coupled relationship between ET and GPP was strengthened after incorporating the effect of VPD on GPP due to reduced time lags among GPP, ET and VPD at the ecosystem scale. R-g, T-a, U-2 and VPD contributed to greater effects through ET than that of GPP on eWUE, while the differences between them were reduced after incorporating VPD on GPP, which may be the source of the dependence of iWUE (GPP center dot VPD/ET) and uWUE (GPP center dot VPD/ET) on environmental conditions. This study enriches the scarce literature on what drives multi-scale water and carbon in a humid orchard and contributes to improving the understanding of the coupled process of water and carbon incorporating the effect of VPD at leaf and ecosystem scales.

AB  - Many benthic quality indices rely on categorising impacts by assigning species to ecological-groups (EGs) that reflect their tolerance to pollution. This is usually based on best professional judgement (BPJ) by experts with access to relevant ecological and taxonomic information. However, international applicability of such indices is restricted in areas where the species taxonomy, biology and response to pollution are poorly understood. In this study we describe an approach that enables objective allocation of EGs in situations where species information is limited. This approach utilised BPJ to categorise the environmental condition of benthic habitats around fish farms in New Zealand in relation to defined enrichment stages (ESs). Quantile regression was then used to model distributions of select taxa. The experts assigned ES scores from 1 to 7, for stations that ranged from relatively natural to excessively enriched (i.e. near-azoic), respectively, with judgements based on a suite of quantitative and qualitative indicators of enrichment, but without reference to detailed species information. The individual BPJ estimates were highly correlated, with minimal bias, indicating good agreement among the experts. Forty key indicator taxa were identified and quantile regression models based on ES(derived as a continuous explanatory variable) were fitted for 34. Abundances of the same taxa were also modelled in response to a more traditional enrichment indicator (organic content, %OM) for comparison with the BPJ technique. The regression approach characterised enrichment responses and objectively identified both the upper and lower tolerance limits of a range of taxa according to their ES and %OM. The models discriminated a number of key indicator taxa, including several that were responsive to low-level changes in ES, but not necessarily %OM. There was reasonable agreement (59%) between EGs derived using the regression approach and those defined using the AMBI database (one of the most commonly applied benthic quality indices). Moreover, the regression method allowed the classification of 10 additional taxa for which our ecological understanding was limited. A key outcome of this study was the acknowledgement that EG characterisations for species need to be regionally validated, no matter how well defined they might appear to be. The combined BPJ/regression analysis approach described provides a valid means of both assigning and validating EG classifications, which will be particularly useful in situations where the taxa are poorly defined, and will enable existing biotic indices to be more broadly applied and interpreted.

AB  - Stream assessment indices have become increasingly important in quantifying the overall status of river networks to define specific targets for restoration initiatives. Such an assessment is particularly needed in degraded environments, such as agricultural streams. Some of these evaluation tools, for instance the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QHEI), are resource intensive because they are field based. Indices that are less dependent on detailed field observations, such as the Morphological Quality Index (MQI), can provide a greater spatial coverage at a lower cost. The objectives of this study are to (1) verify whether a river's morphological quality, quantified using the MQI, can predict the fish habitat quality of a stream determined with the QHEI for eastern Canadian lowland streams, (2) compare the morphological quality, estimated solely from remotely sensed data (RMQI), to the standard MQI, (3) test whether a modified MQI (MMQI) is more appropriate than the original index for the eastern Canadian landscape when comparing with the QHEI fish habitat assessment, and (4) considering the near absence of dams in lowland eastern Canadian streams, compare an MQI where dam-related indicators are optional (MQI-OD) with the QHEI. The hydrogeomorphological and ecological conditions of 118 stream reaches, including 97 in agricultural areas, were assessed across Quebec and southern Ontario using the MQI and QHEI. Each stream was initially evaluated using remotely sensed data: 1-m LiDAR (Quebec) and 5-m DEMs (Ontario), historical aerial photography (1964-2010), and orthophotos. Field assessments were conducted to validate fish habitat and morphological data for both indices. A strong correlation was observed at the reach scale between the MQI and QHEI (r = 0.81) and MQI and RMQI (r = 0.95). Both modified MQI (MMQI and MQI-OD) showed stronger correlation than the standard MQI with the QHEI (r = 0.87), likely because the standard MQI slightly overestimates the current quality status at the habitat scale in the case of small agricultural catchments where main pressures are not always represented by artificial structures. However, because the standard MQI performs generally well in the study area, we suggest using it to ensure consistency and facilitate comparison with other regions. The results from this study demonstrate that the MQI can be used to provide an assessment of ecological (fish habitat) quality. In addition, our results indicate that a remote hydrogeomorphological assessment can be conducted to estimate the overall status of stream networks. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Analysis of the Spatial Distribution of the Air Pollution Types in the District Layout of Warsaw
T2  - ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA
LA  - Polish
AB  - The issue of linkages between land use and air emission types has been bring up in this paper. Based on the example of Warsaw districts, the average distribution of the line point and surface emission in relation to land use has been illustrated. Based, on the literature review related to aspects of urban ecology, physiographic of the city and air emission, the graphical layout of natural ecological functioning of the city has been created.
   Analyzing data and trends in Warsaw should be noted that:
   in 14 districts, the dominant type of emission is the line emission, of which 4 cases represent more than 50% (Srodmie cie, Ochota, Mokotow, Zoliborz), 8 cases are between 40-50% (Praga Poludnie, Praga Polnoc, Wola, Bielany, Wiochy, Bemowo, Ursynow, Wilanow);
   taking to account the communication plans developed in the study of conditions and directions of spatial development, it can be assumed, that the share of line emission compared to the point and the surface ones will be increased;
   development of bypass system, can relieve some roads of central districts, thereby reducing somewhat the share of linear emission, while in districts forming the suburban zone because of implementing major roads and expressways, the linear emission can significantly increase in comparison to the other two emissions;
   impact of traffic pollution on concentrations in the immediate vicinity of the streets with very heavy traffic, is significant, and is an important problem in Warsaw;
   in 4 districts (Wesola, Ursus, Rembertow, Wawer) the highest percentage is a surface emission because they are borders districts, in which the dominant form of housing is single-family houses with individual heating systems;
   as a result of technological progress and increasing the use of renewable energy sources, it can be assumed, that surface emissions will be systematically decreasing;
   in recent years, the organized point emissions due to ecological investment has been reduced, which significantly reduced its negative impact on the environment and in all districts this type of emission has the smallest percentage value.
   When making decisions about spatial management, one has to remember, that they will have an impact on the emission of air pollutants. Therefore, setting roads of higher rank, it is necessary to mind, to trace them, at a distance from residential areas and in an area with good ventilation. Locating point emitters, it should be taken into account (for example) a predominant wind directions and the location of the green areas, which can act as a barrier in relation to residential areas.
   Aspects of the possible impact of pollution on the development of spatial planning should primarily be in the ecophysiographic studies for local spatial management plans and the environmental impact assessment prognosis for project to the local community spatial management plan.

AB  - Fossils of chironomid larvae (non-biting midges) preserved in lake sediments are well-established palaeotemperature indicators which, with the aid of numerical chironomid-based inference models (transfer functions), can provide quantitative estimates of past temperature change. This approach to temperature reconstruction relies on the strong relationship between air and lake surface water temperature and the distribution of individual chironomid taxa (species, species groups, genera) that has been observed in different climate regions (arctic, subarctic, temperate and tropical) in both the Northern and Southern hemisphere. A major complicating factor for the use of chironomids for palaeoclimate reconstruction which increases the uncertainty associated with chironomid-based temperature estimates is that the exact nature of the mechanism responsible for the strong relationship between temperature and chironomid assemblages in lakes remains uncertain. While a number of authors have provided state of the art overviews of fossil chironomid palaeoecology and the use of chironomids for temperature reconstruction, few have focused on examining the ecological basis for this approach. Here, we review the nature of the relationship between chironomids and temperature based on the available ecological evidence. After discussing many of the surveys describing the distribution of chironomid taxa in lake surface sediments in relation to temperature, we also examine evidence from laboratory and field studies exploring the effects of temperature on chironomid physiology, life cycles and behaviour. We show that, even though a direct influence of water temperature on chironomid development, growth and survival is well described, chironomid palaeoclimatology is presently faced with the paradoxical situation that the relationship between chironomid distribution and temperature seems strongest in relatively deep, thermally stratified lakes in temperate and subarctic regions in which the benthic chironomid fauna lives largely decoupled from the direct influence of air and surface water temperature. This finding suggests that indirect effects of temperature on physical and chemical characteristics of lakes play an important role in determining the distribution of lake-living chironomid larvae. However, we also demonstrate that no single indirect mechanism has been identified that can explain the strong relationship between chironomid distribution and temperature in all regions and datasets presently available. This observation contrasts with the previously published hypothesis that climatic effects on lake nutrient status and productivity may be largely responsible for the apparent correlation between chironomid assemblage distribution and temperature. We conclude our review by summarizing the implications of our findings for chironomid-based palaeoclimatology and by pointing towards further avenues of research necessary to improve our mechanistic understanding of the chironomid-temperature relationship.

AB  - 1. Existing methods for identifying ecological community thresholds are designed for univariate indicators or multivariate dimension-reduction of community structure. Most are insensitive to responses of individual taxa with low occurrence frequencies or highly variable abundances, properties of the vast majority of taxa in community data sets. We introduce Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN) to detect changes in taxa distributions along an environmental gradient over space or time, and assess synchrony among taxa change points as evidence for community thresholds.
   2. TITAN uses indicator species scores to integrate occurrence, abundance and directionality of taxa responses. It identifies the optimum value of a continuous variable, x, that partitions sample units while maximizing taxon-specific scores. Indicator z scores standardize original scores relative to the mean and SD of permuted samples along x, thereby emphasizing the relative magnitude of change and increasing the contributions of taxa with low occurrence frequencies but high sensitivity to the gradient. TITAN distinguishes negative (z-) and positive (z+) taxa responses and tracks cumulative responses of declining [sum(z-)] and increasing [sum(z+)] taxa in the community. Bootstrapping is used to estimate indicator reliability and purity as well as uncertainty around the location of individual taxa and community change points.
   3. Using two simulated data sets, TITAN correctly identified taxon and community thresholds in more than 99% of 500 unique versions of each simulation. In contrast, multivariate change-point analysis did not distinguish directional taxa responses, resulting in much wider confidence intervals that in one instance failed to capture thresholds in 38% of the iterations.
   4. Retrospective analysis of macroinvertebrate community response to a phosphorus gradient supported previous threshold estimates, although TITAN produced narrower confidence limits and revealed that several taxa declined at lower levels of phosphorus. Re-analysis of macroinvertebrate responses to an urbanization gradient illustrated disparate change points for declining (0.81-3.3% urban land) and increasing (6.8-26.6%) taxa, whereas the published threshold estimate (20-30%) missed the declining-taxa threshold because it could not distinguish their synchronous decline from the gradual increase in ubiquitous taxa.
   5. Synthesis and applications. By deconstructing communities to assess synchrony of taxon-specific change points, TITAN provides a sensitive and precise alternative to existing methods for assessing community thresholds. TITAN has tremendous potential to inform conservation of rare or threatened species, develop species sensitivity models, identify reference conditions and to support development of numerical regulatory criteria.

AB  - Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) serves as an anti-greenhouse gas, plays multiple roles in aquatic ecosystems, and contributes to the global sulfur cycle. The chlorophyll a (CHL, an indicator of phytoplankton biomass)-DMS relationship is critical for estimating DMS emissions from aquatic ecosystems. Importantly, recent research has identified that the CHL-DMS relationship has a breakpoint, where the relationship is positive below a CHL threshold and negative at higher CHL concentrations. Conventionally, mean regression meth-ods are employed to characterize the CHL-DMS relationship. However, these approaches focus on the re-sponse of mean conditions and cannot illustrate responses of other parts of the DMS distribution, which could be important in order to obtain a complete view of the CHL-DMS relationship. In this study, for the first time, we proposed a novel Bayesian change point quantile regression (BCPQR) model that inte-grates and inherits advantages of Bayesian change point models and Bayesian quantile regression models. Our objective was to examine whether or not the BCPQR approach could enhance the understanding of shifting CHL-DMS relationships in aquatic ecosystems. We fitted BCPQR models at five regression quan-tiles for freshwater lakes and for seas. We found that BCPQR models could provide a relatively complete view on the CHL-DMS relationship. In particular, it quantified the upper boundary of the relationship, representing the limiting effect of CHL on DMS. Based on the results of paired parameter comparisons, we revealed the inequality of regression slopes in BCPQR models for seas, indicating that applying the mean regression method to develop the CHL-DMS relationship in seas might not be appropriate. We also confirmed relationship differences between lakes and seas at multiple regression quantiles. Further, by introducing the concept of DMS emission potential, we found that pH was not likely a key factor leading to the change of the CHL-DMS relationship in lakes. These findings cannot be revealed using piecewise linear regression. We thereby concluded that the BCPQR model does indeed enhance the understand-ing of shifting CHL-DMS relationships in aquatic ecosystems and is expected to benefit effort s aimed at estimating DMS emissions. Considering that shifting (threshold) relationships are not rare and that the BCPQR model can easily be adapted to different systems, the BCPQR approach is expected to have great potential for generalization in other environmental and ecological studies.

AB  - Food-web indicators for marine management are required to describe the functioning and structure of marine food-webs. In Europe, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), intended to lead to a 'good environmental status' of the marine waters, requires indicators of the status of the marine environment that also respond to manageable anthropogenic pressures. Identifying such relationships to pressures is particularly challenging for food-web indicators, as they need to be disentangled from linkages between indicators of different functional groups caused by species interactions. Still, such linkages have not been handled in the indicator development. Here we used multivariate autoregressive time series models to identify how fish indicators in an exploited food-web relate to fishing, climate and eutrophication, while accounting for the linkages between indicators caused by species interactions. We assembled 31-year long time series of indicators of key functional groups of fish in the Central Baltic Sea pelagic food-web, which is characterized by strong trophic links between cod (Gadus morhua) and its main fish prey sprat (Sprattus sprattus) and herring (Clupea harengus). These food-web indicators were either abundance-based indicators of key piscivores (cod) and zooplanktivores (sprat and herring) or size-based indicators of the corresponding trophic groups (biomass of large predatory fish (cod >= 38 cm) and biomass of small prey fish (sprat and herring <10 cm)). Comparative analyses of models with and without linkages among indicators showed that for both types of indicators, linkages corresponding to predator-prey feedbacks and intra-specific density-dependence were essential to explain temporal variation in the indicators. Thus, no indicator-pressure relationships could be found that explained the indicators' variation unless such linkages were accounted for. When accounting for these, we found that the indicators overall respond to multiple pressures acting simultaneously rather than to single pressures, as no pressure alone could explain how the indicators developed over time. The manageable pressures fishing and eutrophication, as well as the prevailing hydrological conditions influenced by climate, were all needed to reproduce the inter-annual changes in these food-web indicators combined, although individual relationships differed between the indicators. We conclude that our innovative indicator-testing framework can therefore be used to identify responses of food-web indicators to manageable pressures while accounting for the biotic interactions in food-webs linking such indicators.

AB  - Alterations in flow regimes of large rivers may originate or increase risks to ecosystems and humans. The Parana River basin (South America) undergoes human pressures (e.g., heavy damming in the upper basin, deforestation, and mixed pollution) that may affect the water quantity and quality of its terminal Delta (Argentina). In this study, after applying univariate and multivariate change-point detection and trend analyses to the daily data series of flows incoming to the Delta (Parana-Santa Fe section), flow characteristics were compared by Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) and Environmental Flow Components (EFC). Some flood characteristics were also compared from hydrometric levels in the middle Delta (San Pedro station). Chemical and microbiological water variables in the main rivers of the "Parana Delta" Biosphere Reserve were examined during two extreme hydrologic years (October 2008 to July 2010) to detect potential risk factors in association with hydrologic conditions. In the Lower Parana River, a historical period (1903-1972) and two more altered periods (1973-1999 wet period and 2000-2014 dry period) were identified. Flow duration curves evidenced different changes in both altered periods, reflecting the joint effect of climatic variability and human influence. The most evident alterations in the flow regime were the lack of record of the extreme-low-flow component, the attenuation of monthly flow seasonality, and the increase in the number of reversals (dry period) and in the variability of maximum and minimum flow dates. These alterations are consistent with the monthly and daily flow regulation by upstream dams evidenced by available data from the current dry period. In the middle Delta, the marked monthly seasonality in flood days decreased only in the wet period. The proportion between the number of flood days exceeding the evacuation level and that of those exceeding the warning level doubled in the wet period but decreased only slightly in the dry period. In the Delta Reserve rivers, concentrations of Escherichia coli, cadmium, lead, iron, manganese, and ammonium exceeded guideline levels under a severe drought and a dispersal of cyanobacteria appeared under a high-flow pulse in La Nia year. The ammonium concentration exceeded the level for human drink with the overbanking flood stage in El Nio year. These occasional detections pose a potential risk to the aquatic life and, especially, to the inhabitants of the Reserve. Flow duration curves, IHA, and EFC are useful tools to evaluate trends or changes of ecological and social relevance in flow regime characteristics.

AB  - Eco-labelling has become part of the business strategy of companies thanks to numerous advantages in terms of engaging with consumers and gaining market quota. The aim of this article is to present a critical discussion on the development and implementation of a new eco-label named pescaenverde, registered in Spain, as the first type III eco-label in the Spanish fishing sector that is based on life cycle approaches for seafood products.
   More specifically, it aims to complement ecosystem-based eco-labels with the computation of the carbon footprint and the energy return on investment (EROI) of seafood products. Furthermore, it proposes to discuss the ecological criteria, certification process or the opportunities and challenges of the market implementation of this eco-label in detail. Finally, the authors argue that life cycle eco-labels should be considered important complements for more specific sector- or ecosystem-oriented labels already in use, rather than direct competitors.
   There has been much criticism towards the eco-labelling sector as regards the transparency and scientific rigour of its standards. The fishing and seafood sector, which has experienced a boom in eco-labelling in recent years, due mainly to the strength of the Marine Stewardship Council certification scheme, is not alien to this controversy, since critics advocate expanding the concept of sustainable fisheries beyond an ecosystem approach in order to account for global environmental concerns such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or energy use. Not surprisingly, the European Union and other authorities currently encourage eco-labels to base their ecological criteria on life cycle approaches. Therefore, the current study discusses the ecological criteria, certification process or the opportunities and challenges of the market implementation of this eco-label in detail.
   The specificity of the life cycle inventory scheme used in pescaenverde delivers an accurate computation of environmental impacts for the specific case of Spanish fisheries. However, the geographical expansion of this scheme to other nations or regions will be conditioned by an important software adaptation to the particular inventory characteristics of the new fisheries, fleets and products.
   Adapting ecological criteria to other situations would also need substantial discussion, since the use of this certification scheme is not intended to contrast or compare seafood products against each other but to provide consumers with an easily identifiable label through which they can detect environmentally sustainable practices in terms of GHG emissions and energy use in the fishing fleets supporting the seafood products purchased.

AB  - Conversion from rangeland to cropland potentially influences soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics and biochemical properties. The purpose of the current study was to assess changes in soil properties and investigate the interaction between SOM and enzyme activities following cultivation of native rangelands for more than 40 years. The quantities of soil organic carbon (C) and microbial biomass C (MBC), aggregate stability, microbial respiration rate (MRR), potential C mineralization (PCM) and the activities of soil enzymes involved in C, N, P and S cycling at the 0-20 and 20-40 cm depths were evaluated in never-cultivated natural rangelands and their corresponding farmlands with similar soil type and climatic conditions at Dehnow located in Central west, Iran. Cultivation in native rangelands resulted in a significant decline of most soil properties in farmlands, depending on soil sampling depths. Conversion of rangelands to their farmland counterparts decreased soil C (50-66 %), MBC (48-61 %), MRR (20-44 %), PCM (45-59 %), the activities of urease (5-17 %), invertase (7-28 %) and arylsulfatase (17-20 %) per soil mass, while increased C turnover rate (61-63 %), microbial metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) values (41-54 %) and enzyme activities per unit C and MBC (61-190 %) without affecting microbial quotient (MBC/C ratio) values and the activities of soil phosphatases per soil mass. The decreases in soil microbial and biochemical properties were largely the result of a substantial decline in soil C contents and aggregate stability by tillage activities in farmlands. Although the absolute activities of soil enzymes (i.e., activity per dry soil mass) showed inconsistent responses to land use changes and were even less responsive than soil organic C and MBC contents to changing land uses, the specific enzyme activities expressed either per unit of C or MBC tended to increase considerably and consistently with this conversion and were more sensitive than soil C and MBC contents. Soil C turnover rates and metabolic quotients were found to correlate positively with the specific enzyme activities, indicating an interaction between SOM and enzyme activities. The specific enzymatic activity could be an appropriate and integrative simple index to (1) assess soil quality changes, (2) detect changes in soil microbial community; and even (3) associate the losses of SOM with the presence of metabolically more active decomposer biota in rangelands cultivated for the long term.

AB  - Indicator selection is a critical step in conducting effective strategic cumulative effects assessments. Selecting an appropriate set of indicators to represent multiple and sometimes disparate values is particularly challenging because the interpretation of impacts depends on indicator roles and relationships among indicators. However, systematic approaches for selection of indicators for strategic cumulative effects assessments (CEA) are unclear. For a 909,000 ha case study area involving 214 watersheds in coastal British Columbia, we defined a suite of twenty indicators linked to six Valued Components (VCs) that could be forecasted for forest, riparian and species at risk as three key values consistent with present land-use planning policies in British Columbia, Canada. We used spatio-temporal process-based models to project and integrate the stressor-response relationships between forest harvesting and run-of-river power resource management activities and the suite of selected indicators. For a likely development scenario, we assessed the correlative structure among projected indicator responses and, using a PCA-based analysis of outcomes, identified both patterns of potential redundancies and ecological processes linking indicators and dominant processes influencing VCs. Our results suggest that strategic CEAs will benefit if indicator selections are not made independently for each VC. Identifying the type of indicator, i.e., pressure or condition, and scale of its representation was important in determining if assessed impacts for individual indicators could be appropriately integrated to quantify overall impacts in the landscape. Consideration of indicator-indicator relationships both within and among VCs clarifies the influences of spatial scale, potential redundancies among indicators, and the role of underlying ecological processes in interpreting and aggregating indicator responses. Our case study demonstrates that relative scales of ecological processes, disturbances and management actions can limit how cohesive the interpretations of impacts may be across VCs in strategic CEA. Analysis of correlative structures among the twenty indicators suggested criteria-based statistical redundancies occurred between only two indicator pairs, however PCA suggested three ecological processes (road disturbance, Spotted Owl habitat state, retention and recruitment of old forest) were operating to relate behaviors of multiple indicators. Careful consideration of the interacting roles of ecological processes as they relate to values is required when determining appropriate indicators and designing how best to aggregate indicator results into an effective strategic CEA. A three step systematic and generalizable approach to forecasting present and future states of indicators will improve efficiencies and effectiveness of strategic CEA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - European directives (Water Framework Directive - WFD and Marine Strategy Framework Directive - MSFD) require a regular survey of several descriptors of the Environmental Status of coastal waters of the North-east Atlantic Ocean. Especially for the MSFD, which may concern large continental shelf areas where measurements are scarce, realistic ecological models can help assessing the Environmental Status. The ECO-MARS3D model of the pelagic ecosystem of the Bay of Biscay and English Channel continental shelf (NE Atlantic) has been developed for these applied purposes and validated against various types of historic data. This first paper deals with the basic biogeochemical version, which contains inorganic nutrients (NH4, NO3, PO4, Si(OH)(4)), three phytoplankton bulk types (diatoms, nanoflagellates and dinoflagellates), two zooplankton bulk types, particulate detrital forms and dissolved oxygen. A second paper presents a version of this model including 3 harmful phytoplanktonic groups. A simulation covering the 2000-2010 decade is compared to satellite sea surface data for temperature and surface chlorophyll, to the Southampton-Bilbao and Ouistreham-Portsmouth ferrybox surface data for temperature, salinity, chlorophyll and nutrients, to point samples provided by the French network of phytoplankton monitoring (REPHY) for inorganic nutrients and chlorophyll, and to high frequency time series of dissolved oxygen measured by a moored automatic buoy. From a spatial point of view, the model provides realistic fields of annual means of surface temperature (but with a systematic bias of about + 1.0 degrees C) and phytoplanktonic biomass. From a seasonal point of view, the temperature and salinity follow correctly the observed variations. For nutrient and total chlorophyll, the model succeeds in reproducing the difference amounting to one order of magnitude between the North Sea coastal zones and the oligotrophic oceanic zone above the abyssal plain of the bay of Biscay. It also reproduces the spring-neap tide oscillation visible in satellite observations of surface chlorophyll. Simulated seasonal cycles are realistic in the coastal stations, but the French Atlantic coast seems slightly too nutrient-rich. In coastal eutrophicated areas, the model does not produce chlorophyll peaks as high as measured. In the Vilaine bay (France), the summer hypoxic conditions (down to 4 mg/L O-2 or less) are correctly reproduced. This ecological model has been used off-line to map some classical eutrophication descriptors (winter DIN and DIP, March-October 90th percentile of chlorophyll) used by the WFD and MSFD European directives. It has also been turned into an operational real-time mode, as part of the French Previmer project.

AB  - Drylands are ecosystems, where lack of rains imposes harsh conditions for the survival of organisms. These ecosystems are also susceptible to degradation and desertification. Their conservation depends on the understanding of the ecological functioning of vegetation and soil. In drylands, the vegetation is spatially structured as a mosaic of patches (vegetation) and interpatches (bare soil). This structure is a consequence of plant-plant interactions (facilitation and competition). Empirical data and modeling approaches reinforce the role of ecological facilitation for the maintenance of all organisms in drylands. However, the true range of facilitation is still poorly known. Here, we explored data of meso- and microarthropods living in soil, as bioindicators, to infer the range of facilitation provided by plants to soil. As dependent variables, we regard data of abundances and species richness collected in random patches (independent samples) and bare soil places. Data from patch size and distances between bare soil and patches were arranged in a single chute. Thus, one may consider a one-dimensional coordinate system, where zero is the border; negative coordinates are distances between bare soil and the border, while positive coordinates represent patch sizes. Discrete portions of this system are taken to calculate averages and variances of abundance and species richness. With these statistics, we investigate how soil communities vary across the patch border. Techniques of data transformation and signal analysis allowed us to reduce the data noise, reveal a continuous mean behavior, and fit a logistic function. Our findings indicate that soil communities change suddenly from simple patterns to numerous and diverse communities in bare soil regions. This abrupt change of fauna quantities, around 0.35 and 0.5 m outside the patch border, means that the facilitation of vegetation on soil goes beyond the patch border. However, the abundance and richness of soil communities in bare soil are small in comparison to overall quantities of soil arthropods. Consequently, variations in quantities of arthropods on bare soil do not necessarily reflect the main role of these soil arthropods for soil functions, which mainly occurs under the patches. Also, we found a minimum patch size (radius approximate to 0.5 m) able to maintain high diverse communities in soil. Accordingly, our results reveal information that can be interpreted in terms of soil amelioration, and, therefore, it indicates the range of plant facilitation, and the minimum patch size able to produce soil amelioration. These findings provide objective values that can be employed to update the general understanding of the ecological dynamics of drylands,as well as to better plan restoration and conservation actions.

AB  - Spatially explicit knowledge on grassland extent and management is critical to understand and monitor the impact of grassland use intensity on ecosystem services and biodiversity. While regional studies allow detailed insights into land use and ecosystem service interactions, information on a national scale can aid biodiversity assessments. However, for most European countries this information is not yet widely available. We used an analysis-ready-data cube that contains dense time series of co-registered Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data, covering the extent of Germany. We propose an algorithm that detects mowing events in the time series based on residuals from an assumed undisturbed phenology, as an indicator of grassland use intensity. A self-adaptive ruleset enabled to account for regional variations in land surface phenology and non-stationary time series on a pixelbasis. We mapped mowing events for the years from 2017 to 2020 for permanent grassland areas in Germany. The results were validated on a pixel level in four of the main natural regions in Germany based on reported mowing events for a total of 92 (2018) and 78 (2019) grassland parcels. Results for 2020 were evaluated with combined time series of Landsat, Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope data. The mean absolute percentage error between detected and reported mowing events was on average 40% (2018), 36% (2019) and 35% (2020). Mowing events were on average detected 11 days (2018), 7 days (2019) and 6 days (2020) after the reported mowing. Performance measures varied between the different regions of Germany, and lower accuracies were found in areas that are revisited less frequently by Sentinel-2. Thus, we assessed the influence of data availability and found that the detection of mowing events was less influenced by data availability when at least 16 cloud-free observations were available in the grassland season. Still, the distribution of available observations throughout the season appeared to be critical. On a national scale our results revealed overall higher shares of less intensively mown grasslands and smaller shares of highly intensively managed grasslands. Hotspots of the latter were identified in the alpine foreland in Southern Germany as well as in the lowlands in the Northwest of Germany. While these patterns were stable throughout the years, the results revealed a tendency to lower management intensity in the extremely dry year 2018. Our results emphasize the ability of the approach to map the intensity of grassland management throughout large areas despite variations in data availability and environmental conditions.

AB  - This paper provides results of assessment of the tritium distribution in the vegetation cover in the areas of underground nuclear explosions at the Semipalatinsk Test Site (STS). The research was conducted at the former "Degelen" test site along the streams that are one of the main channels of tritium migration from underground nuclear explosions epicenters. The dominant plant species Carex supine and Achnatherum splendens that belong to different ecological groups in relation to humidity were selected as representatives of the vegetation cover. The TFWT (tissue free water tritium) and OBT (organically bound tritium) activity concentrations in the vegetation cover were measurement. TFWT activity concentration in the samples of both plant species had high values with an average of up to 30 kBq kg-1. The OBT activity concentration was 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than the TFWT in all plant samples. The TFWT and OBT activity concentrations in vegetation samples are closely correlated (r = 0.75, p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was found between the content of tritium in the samples of Carex supine and those of Achnatherum splendens taken at the same locations. OBT/HTO ratios for vegetation samples of both species were close to equilibrium ratio used in environmental transfer models. In some cases, OBT/HTO ratios were significantly lower than one, which indicates that simple environmental transfer models may not accurately predict the behavior of HTO and OBT in different environmental compartments. The average OBT/HTO ratio for soil samples (0.6 +/- 0.1) close to the equilibrium value indicates the equilibrium condition at the research area. The obtained [OBT]plant/[OBT]soil ratios indicate that soil organic matter accumulates tritium from year to year. However, in some locations with high tritium contamination ratios [OBT]plant/[OBT]soil were more than one due to OBT activity in soils is almost the same as OBT activity in plants. It was found that the nature of the spatial distribution of tritium in the vegetation cover in the areas of underground nuclear explosions is complex, and obviously depends on the location of the tunnels in which nuclear tests were conducted, as well as on the peculiarities of the hydrological regime of underground and surface waters, which are the main channels of tritium migration in the research area. Thus, the vegetation cover reflects the spatial distribution of tritium contamination in the sites of underground nuclear explosions and can be used as an indicator of the radiation situation when monitoring radiation-hazardous areas.

AB  - Sedimentary pigments can provide information on various aspects of benthic processes and biogeochemistry. In this study, sediments from sites at depths of 140 to 1850 m spanning the Pakistan margin oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), and representing dramatic contrasts in depositional conditions and benthic communities, were analysed for pigment yields and compositions. This has allowed a rare consideration of how different factors, including oxygen concentration, organic matter (OM) supply and biological activity (e.g., degree of bioturbation) may influence sedimentary pigment distribution in a continental margin environment. It has also allowed one of the first efforts to study the impact of biological activity on pigment concentrations in the natural environment, rather than in a microcosm setting. Total extractable surface sediment pigment concentrations showed a range of similar to 1.5-49 mu g g(-1) of dry sediment. The pigment suite was dominated by pheophytin and pheophorbide (which together constituted similar to 75% of total pigments), with minor amounts of chlorophyll-a, alloxanthin, diatoxanthin, zeaxanthin and beta-carotene. Low oxygen concentration appeared to influence pigment abundance by increasing the concentration of refractory pigments ultimately buried. In addition, maximal pigment abundances were associated with minimal amounts of sediment mixing by macrofauna, and at one site macrofaunal digestion may have altered the relative dominance of the different pheopigments. In contrast, the lack of a marked increase in pigment concentrations after the summer monsoon plus the lack of a correlation between pigment concentration and water depth suggest that OM supply plays a relatively small role in controlling sedimentary pigments. Pigment concentrations and suites, together with modelled decay half-lives (similar to 0.8-15 years), suggest that in general OM on the Pakistan margin, despite the low oxygen concentrations and monsoon-driven productivity, is surprisingly degraded compared to that on other continental margins with OM-rich sediments. As an exception to this general situation, pigment suites appeared to be relatively "fresh" (i.e., contained more labile components) compared to those found on the Oman margin of the Arabian Sea, but overall concentrations were lower. This is consistent with the higher oxygen concentrations, productivity and macrofaunal abundances found on the western margin of the Arabian Sea. Principle component analysis of pigment suites showed that they correlated with an amino-acid-based degradation index (DI). Thus, the pigment composition of marine sediments is related to, and may serve as an indicator of, the state of decay of sedimentary OM. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is widely accepted that narcotic use during pregnancy and specific environmental factors (e.g., maternal immune activation and chronic stress) may increase risk of neuropsychiatric illness in offspring. However, little progress has been made in defining human-specific in utero neurodevelopmental pathology due to ethical and technical challenges associated with accessing human prenatal brain tissue. Here we utilized human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to generate reproducible organoids that recapitulate dorsal forebrain development including early corticogenesis. We systemically exposed organoid samples to chemically defined "enviromimetic" compounds to examine the developmental effects of various narcotic and neuropsychiatric-related risk factors within tissue of human origin. In tandem experiments conducted in parallel, we modeled exposure to opiates (mu-opioid agonist endomorphin), cannabinoids (WIN 55,212-2), alcohol (ethanol), smoking (nicotine), chronic stress (human cortisol), and maternal immune activation (human Interleukin-17a; IL17a). Human-derived dorsal forebrain organoids were consequently analyzed via an array of unbiased and high-throughput analytical approaches, including state-of-the-art TMT-16plex liquid chromatography/mass-spectrometry (LC/MS) proteomics, hybrid MS metabolomics, and flow cytometry panels to determine cell-cycle dynamics and rates of cell death. This pipeline subsequently revealed both common and unique proteome, reactome, and metabolome alterations as a consequence of enviromimetic modeling of narcotic use and neuropsychiatric-related risk factors in tissue of human origin. However, of our 6 treatment groups, human-derived organoids treated with the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 exhibited the least convergence of all groups. Single-cell analysis revealed that WIN 55,212-2 increased DNA fragmentation, an indicator of apoptosis, in human-derived dorsal forebrain organoids. We subsequently confirmed induction of DNA damage and apoptosis by WIN 55,212-2 within 3D human-derived dorsal forebrain organoids. Lastly, in a BrdU pulse-chase neocortical neurogenesis paradigm, we identified that WIN 55,212-2 was the only enviromimetic treatment to disrupt newborn neuron numbers within human-derived dorsal forebrain organoids. Cumulatively this study serves as both a resource and foundation from which human 3D biologics can be used to resolve the non-genomic effects of neuropsychiatric risk factors under controlled laboratory conditions. While synthetic cannabinoids can differ from naturally occurring compounds in their effects, our data nonetheless suggests that exposure to WIN 55,212-2 elicits neurotoxicity within human-derived developing forebrain tissue. These human-derived data therefore support the long-standing belief that maternal use of cannabinoids may require caution so to avoid any potential neurodevelopmental effects upon developing offspring in utero.

AB  - Zooplankton structure may serve as predictor of a multiplicity of environmental conditions, including long-scale distance between shallow water bodies. Two different categories of zooplankton indices (1/ biocoenotic indices, including dominating species; 2/ trait-based approaches, including ecological groups: littoral vs. pelagic com-munity and functional feeding groups) were compared in small water bodies of two regions of Europe (1/ Northern water bodies (N-WB): Poland, and 2/ Southern water bodies (S-WB): Croatia). We hypothesized that latitudinal variation between these regions will result in distinguishing specific environmental factors that in turn affect the structure of zooplankton communities. In order to avoid weather extremes in both countries, we focused our research on less frequently investigated periods of the year; during the unvegetated and mild -temperature seasons (spring and autumn). Despite well pronounced differences in some abiotic characteristics of water between both regions (higher chlorophyll a and phosphorus contents in N-WB compared to better oxy-genated waters and higher water transparency in S-WB) we observed rather uniform pattern with respect to zooplankton trait-based indices in N-WB and S-WB. This may have been caused by poor habitat heterogeneity due to macrophyte absence (spring) or decaying state (autumn) and poor food supply during the spring/autumn seasons. Planktonic and detrivorous rotifers (e.g. from genera Keratella and Brachionus) predominated in both countries. Ecological and trophic functional traits were mostly determined by the morphometric and trophic properties. Irrespective of latitudinal variation, water transparency emerged as a significant factor, negatively affecting zooplankton abundance, especially the dominating detrivorous rotifers, and positively littoral zoo -plankton. Moreover, an increase in water area, related to higher contents of nutrients and food resources, supported a higher abundance of the majority of zooplankton feeding guilds. Our results suggested that only at the level of taxa the distinctiveness between the two European regions, northern and southern, was clear. Apart from taxa dominating in both countries (Keratella cochlearis, Bosmina longirostris), Polyarthra spp. and Eudiaptomus gracilis dominated exclusively in Croatia and Cyclops sp. in Poland during the unvegetated and temperature-transitional seasons. This indicates that only the taxonomic approach, referring to certain dom-inating species, was a sensitive tool. Functional trait-based approaches, despite providing relevant information on the quality of aquatic ecosystems, are not sufficiently sensitive in identification of latitudinal variation of zooplankton in the spring/autumn season.

AB  - Planting eucalypt stands in the Iberian Peninsula is controversial. In Galicia (NW Spain) the area covered by eucalypts and the intensity of eucalypt timber harvesting are among the highest in Europe. In this region, management plans for forest resources are intended for relatively homogeneous territorial units, smaller than the province, called forest districts (ForDis). The status of eucalypt plantations in ForDis is usually assumed to be highly variable, although this has not yet been quantified. Within this framework, the present study aimed to integrate an existing Eucalyptus globulus distribution model for current conditions and two different climate change scenarios with current forest cover (including eucalypt plantations) to provide quantitative and spatiallyexplicit information for identifying ForDis where eucalypt plantations may become problematic. Four parameters (suitability, importance, potential expansion and fragmentation) comprising 13 related indicators were calculated for eucalypt plantations in each of the 19 ForDis in the region. The findings show that more than 44% of the afforested area is covered by eucalypts in the province of A Corun?a and in forest districts VI and XVIII (in Lugo and Pontevedra, respectively). A huge continuous patch of eucalypt, of more than 35,000 ha, was detected across two ForDis (I and VI). The potentially high ecological and financial risks associated with this vast area of monoculture would negatively affect the sustainability and multifunctionality of these forest ecosystems. Analysis of the expected suitability of areas for E. globulus in forthcoming climate change scenarios identified four inland ForDis (IX, X in Lugo, XVI in Pontevedra and XI in Ourense) where an important increase in cover by this species may occur if no action is taken. Moreover, these areas overlap with the large ongoing expansion already observed for the more productive and frost-resistant E. nitens. The findings also revealed edge-dominated native broadleaved forest patches in the habitat suitable for E. globulus in the provinces of A Corun?a and Lugo. Although the current level of occupancy of eucalypt within natural protected areas (NPAs) is moderate, the suitability of these areas for eucalypt plantations will increase in the predicted climate change scenario, possibly leading to aggravation of potential conflicts in these biodiversity hotspots. Regional forest agencies should therefore increase monitoring efforts to prevent further impacts on native forest and natural protected areas.
   The proposed quantitative indicators and methodology used are intended to be useful for forest planners and policy decision-makers in other regions where current and future conflicts related to exotic tree plantations are expected.

AB  - Hardening of shorelines has been extensively implemented in many parts of the developed world. This also applies to banks of German Federal Waterways, which are mostly fixed by ripraps to prevent bank erosion as a consequence of wave disturbance by shipping traffic. Since ripraps notably alter functions of riparian ecosystems and nature conservation demands recently gained in importance along waterways, alternatives for ripraps play an increasing role.
   Front-fixed banks are ripraps parallel to the shoreline and embedded in the waterway's channel with an unsecured bank of low steepness behind them. Thus, they are suitable to prevent banks from erosion. However, it is unclear how they can contribute to the ecological enhancement of riparian vegetation along waterways.
   Therefore, we compared riparian vegetation of ripraps and front-fixed banks with unsecured banks along the German rivers Main and Danube to assess the ecological efficiency of front-fixed banks. Disturbance by alternating water levels was the lowest at ripraps, whereas disturbance levels were higher at front-fixed and unfortified banks. We used an ordination and indicator species analysis to reveal differences in species composition. The results of the indicator species analysis were analyzed regarding species' biotope origin, light and moisture demand and life strategy. We analyzed species diversity and calculated functional diversity indices to display the prevalent ecosystem processes.
   Higher variation in species composition, common indicator species, a strong vertical layering of woody riparian vegetation and similar site conditions at front-fixed and unfortified banks revealed higher similarities in species composition between them than to other bank type combinations. Limnic species occurred with a higher frequency at unfortified and front-fixed banks, whereas terrestrial species were more frequent at ripraps. Light-tolerant species were more common at ripraps, whereas species' demand for moisture was higher at front-fixed and unfortified banks than at ripraps. Cr-strategists occurred more frequently with increasing disturbance level, whereas c-strategists were more common at ripraps.
   Ripraps had the highest species diversity levels whereas functional diversity tended to be higher at front-fixed and unfortified banks. This indicates a higher trait complementarity and thus a higher specialization towards alternating water levels, wherefore a higher degree of naturalness can be assumed in these habitats.
   Nature conservation efforts along German Federal Waterways should focus on the restoration of flooding dynamics, as species typical for riverine habitats are more common at front-fixed and unfortified banks than at ripraps. Since front-fixed banks bear traits suited for the reconnection of rivers and their floodplains and for bank protection, they are a suitable alternative to promote biodiversity along German Federal Waterways.

AB  - Large reservoirs are an increasingly common feature across tropical landscapes because of their importance for water supply, flood control and hydropower, but their ecological conditions are infrequently evaluated. Our objective was to assess the range of disturbances for two large tropical reservoirs and their influences on benthic macroinvertebrates. We tested three hypotheses: i) a wide variation in the level of environmental disturbance can be observed among sites in the reservoirs; ii) the two reservoirs would exhibit a different degree of disturbance level; and iii) the magnitude of disturbance would influence the structure and composition of benthic assemblages. For each reservoir, we assessed land use (macroscale), physical habitat structure (mesoscale), and water quality (microscale). We sampled 40 sites in the littoral zones of both Tres Marias and Sao Simao Reservoirs (Minas Gerais, Brazil). At the macroscale, we measured cover percentages of land use categories in buffer areas at each site, where each buffer was a circular arc of 250 m. At the mesoscale, we assessed the presence of human disturbances in the riparian and drawdown zones at the local (site) scale. At the microscale, we assessed water quality at each macroinvertebrate sampling station using the Micro Disturbance Index (MDI). To evaluate anthropogenic disturbance of each site, we calculated an integrated disturbance index (IDI) from a buffer disturbance index (BDI) and a local disturbance index (LDI). For each site, we calculated richness and abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates, Chironomidae genera richness, abundance and percent Chironomidae individuals, abundance and percent EPT individuals, richness and percent EPT taxa, abundance and percent resistant individuals, and abundance and percent non-native individuals. We also evaluated the influence of disturbance on benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages at the entire-reservoir scale. The BDI, LDI and IDI had significantly greater average scores at Sao Simao than at Tres Marias Reservoir. The significantly greater differences in IDI scores for Sao Simao Reservoir were reflected in 10 of the 13 Ekman-Birge dredge biotic metrics and in 5 of 13 of the kick-net biotic metrics. We also observed clear ranges of disturbances within both reservoirs at macro (BDI) and mesoscales (LDI) and in water quality, but an insignificant range in MDI results. However, we found no significant relationship between the benthic macroinvertebrate metrics and the BDI, LDI, and IDI among sites within a single reservoir. Hence, we believe that benthic macroinvertebrate distributions in those reservoirs were influenced by other factors or that reservoir macroinvertebrates (dominated by chironomids) were poor indicators of disturbance at the site scale.

AB  - Conservation tillage and judicious use of animal manures as fertilizers can make significant contributions for sustainable food production in the twenty-first century. Identifying and understanding the many interactions occurring within agricultural systems is fundamental for accomplishing this feat. This paper synthesizes 14 years of research results from a study that began in the early 1990s in which researchers from USDA-ARS and the University of Georgia investigated cropping system influences on nutrient management under natural rainfall. Increases in C and N with no-till resulted in improved soil structure that increased infiltration rate and soil water availability. Biological activity as indicated by earthworms was greater with no-till and poultry litter (PL). In all but the very driest year, yields of cotton and corn increased on average 10-27% with no-till and 32-42% with combination of no-till and PL. On the other hand soil nutrient accumulation, particularly P and Zn from long-term use of poultry litter in corn production, reached excessive levels and could present environmental risks. Drainage increased in no-till raising the risk of leaching of nutrients into the soil profile. However, runoff decreased in no-till and the presence of a rye cover crop during the winter reduced the leaching losses of N compared to no cover crop. During cotton production under relative drought, no-till and poultry litter led to somewhat elevated dissolved phosphorus concentration in runoff, and fluometuron was detected in runoff and drainage while pendimethalin was not. Fecal indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli and fecal enterococci), and the hormones estradiol and testosterone were observed in drainage and runoff but concentrations were similar across all treatments. By conducting the study for an extended period under natural environmental conditions, we were able to highlight real risks and potentials of the contrasting cropping systems. While 6 out of 14 years of relative drought might have limited the water quality response of treatments, such droughts are common features of the weather pattern in the region. Even then, use of no-till as the predominant tillage system was supported by improved yields. Fertilizer management, especially crop N need-based use of PL, requires closer monitoring to insure that production advantages of no-till and poultry litter are not offset by concerns with environmental risks. Long-term research requires sustained resource inputs to answer critical questions of environmental risk and emerging unknown issues.

AB  - Early-warning signals of a regime shift (EWS) indicate, for a wide range of systems, if a tipping-point is being approached. In ecology, EWS are well established from a theoretical perspective but are far from unequivocal when applied to field data. The gap between theory and application is caused by a set of limitations, like the lack of coherence between different EWS, data acquisition issues, and false results. Experiments assessing EWS may provide an empirical mechanistic understanding of why an EWS was observed (or failed to be observed), which often cannot be elucidated by simple computational modeling or pure environmental data. Here we focused on aquatic experiments to explore to what extent the existing EWS experiments can bridge the gap between the theory and real-world application. For that, we used the Thomson-ISI Web of Science (c) database to retrieve EWS experiments executed before early-2020, detailing their experimental designs and each EWS assessed. Success rates - correct anticipation of tipping points - were around 70% for the most used EWS (assessment of autocorrelation, variance, recovery, and shape of the distribution using abundance, Chlorophyll-a, Phycocyanin, and dissolved oxygen data). Yet, no EWS showed to be 100% reliable, and their use demands cautious interpretation. As a rule, we observed that experiments were not designed to tackle issues encountered in real-world situations. They lack a deep mechanistic understanding of why, when, and how an EWS was observed or not. When experiments did aim to assess issues encountered in the real world, the experimental designs were often of low ecological significance. We also investigated the relationship between sampling and the success rate of EWS, observing that the sampling regime might have to be tailor-made towards specific monitoring objectives. Moreover, experiments have taught us that the use of EWS can be more versatile than expected, going from monitoring the extinction of single populations to the anticipation of transient regime shifts. Most of the experiments presented here supported empirical proof of the existence of EWS in aquatic systems. Still, to bridge the gap between theory and application, experiments will have to move closer to real-world conditions and better support a mechanistic understanding of why EWS may succeed or fail to anticipate a regime shift. For that, we provide six elements to take into account when designing experiments that could enhance the capabilities of EWS to go beyond the stage of proof-of-concept.

AB  - Many countries are faced with monumental cleanup tasks remaining from World War II and the Cold War and consistent methodologies are essential to assess the risk from pollutants and the risk from cleanup. In the USA, the Department of Energy (DOE), and other federal and state agencies need to be able to rapidly evaluate the risk to ecological resources for remediation projects. While ecological risk assessments for radionuclides and other contaminants can be performed for different species, evaluations of species assemblages, communities, and ecosystems is more difficult. We summarize an evaluation method for ecological resources on individual remediation units that will allow comparison among a large number of units and that can be modified and applied to the DOE complex-wide. We evaluated the deactivation and decommissioning (D & D) facilities at the Hanford site as case studies. Remediation of these sites has the potential to provide harm to, or increase the value of, ecological resources during and after the process. The evaluation method includes three categories: (1) general steps, (2) ecological descriptions, and (3) ecological ratings. The general steps include identifying the categories of resources (level of resource value), identifying the units to be evaluated (e.g., remediation units), identifying a reasonable ecological buffer around the evaluation units, identifying the remediation options (from milestones or other agreements), and developing a rating scale. Ecological descriptions include identifying previous ecological values of specific areas on the evaluation unit, conducting field studies to assess the current conditions, and summarizing the percent of each resource value on the evaluation unit and buffer area. The ecological risk of harm is determined by using the rating scale to evaluate the potential harm to the ecological (and eco-cultural) resources on each evaluation unit currently, during remediation, and in the post-remediation phase. Currently, the risks (potential harm) to ecological resources on the D & D facilities at the Hanford site are non-discernible, but they increase to very high (for reactors) during remediation when there is physical disruption, increased traffic and personnel, and possible increased contamination. Following remediation, the potential harm to ecological resources is low, and the value may be increased due to restoration of native vegetation on sites that were largely industrial prior to remediation. These methods provide managers, regulators, tribes, and the general public with assurance that ecological and eco-cultural resources and the environment are being protected during and following remediation.

AB  - The effects of ongoing changes in ocean carbonate chemistry on plankton ecology have important implications for food webs and biogeochemical cycling. However, conflicting results have emerged regarding species-specific responses to pCO2 enrichment and thus community responses have been difficult to predict. To assess community level effects (e.g., production) of altered carbonate chemistry, studies are needed that capitalize on the benefits of controlled experiments but also retain features of intact ecosystems that may exacerbate or ameliorate the effects observed in single-species or single cohort experiments. We performed incubations of natural plankton communities from Narragansett Bay, RI, USA in winter at ambient bay temperatures (5-13 degrees C), light and nutrient concentrations. Three levels of controlled and constant CO2 concentrations were imposed, simulating past, present and future conditions at mean pCO(2) levels of 224, 361, and 724 mu atm respectively. Samples for carbonate analysis, chlorophyll a, plankton size-abundance, and plankton species composition were collected daily and phytoplankton growth rates in three different size fractions (< 5, 5-20, and > 20 mu m) were measured at the end of the 7-day incubation period. Community composition changed during the incubation period with major increases in relative diatom abundance, which were similar across pCO(2) treatments. At the end of the experiment, 24-hr growth responses to pCO(2) levels varied as a function of cell size. The smallest size fraction (< 5 mu m) grew faster at the elevated pCO(2) level. In contrast, the 5-20 mu m size fraction grew fastest in the Present treatment and there were no significant differences in growth rate among treatments in the > 20 mu m size fraction. Cell size distribution shifted toward smaller cells in both the Past and Future treatments but remained unchanged in the Present treatment. Similarity in Past and Future treatments for cell size distribution and growth rate (5-20 mu m size fraction) illustrate non-monotonic effects of altered pCO(2) on ecological indicators and may be related to opposing physiological effects of high CO2 and low pH both within and among species. Interaction of these effects with other factors (e.g., nutrients, light, temperature, grazing, initial species composition) may explain variability among published studies. The absence of clear treatment-specific effects at the community level suggests that extrapolation of species-specific responses or experiments with only present day and future pCO(2) treatments levels could produce misleading predictions of,ocean acidification impacts on plankton production.

AB  - The Antarctic Peninsula is one of the most rapidly warming regions on Earth, as evidenced by a recent increase in the intensity and duration of summer melting, the recession of glaciers and the retreat and collapse of ice shelves. Despite this, only a limited number of well-dated near shore marine and lake sediment based palaeoenvironmental records exist from this region: so our understanding of the longer-term context of this rapid climate change is limited. Here we provide new well-dated constraints on the deglaciation history, and changes in sea ice and climate based on analyses of sedimentological proxies, diatoms and fossil pigments in a sediment core collected from an isolation basin on Beak Island in Prince Gustav Channel, NE Antarctic Peninsula (63 degrees 36'S, 57 degrees 20'W). Twenty two radiocarbon dates provided a chronology for the core including a minimum modelled age for deglaciation of 10,602 cal yr BP, following the onset of marine sedimentation. Conditions remained cold and perennial sea ice persisted in this part of Prince Gustav Channel until c. 9372 cal yr BR This was followed by a seasonally open marine environment until at least 6988 cal yr BP, corresponding with the early retreat and disintegration of the ice shelf in southern Prince Gustav Channel. Following isolation of the basin from 6988 cal yr BP a relatively cold climate persisted until 3169 cal yr BR A Mid-late Holocene climate optimum occurred between 3169 and 2120 cal yr BP, inferred from multiple indicators of increased biological production. This postdates the onset of the Mid-late Holocene climate optimum in the South Shetland Islands (4380 cal yr BP) and the South Orkney Islands (3800 cal yr BP) suggesting that cooler climate systems of the Weddell Sea Gyre to the east of the Peninsula may have buffered the onset of warming. Climate deterioration is inferred from c. 2120 cal yr BP until 543 cal yr BR This was followed by warming. Superimposed on this warming trend, the instrumental record of recent warming at nearby Hope Bay is mirrored by a recent increase in the lake's primary production and a shift in the diatom communities in the uppermost 3 cm of sediments, suggesting that this is amongst the first records to show an ecological response to recent rapid temperature increase. These new constraints on glaciological and climate events in Prince Gustav Channel are reviewed in the context of wider changes in the Antarctic region. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The common practice of incorporating environmental indices into population models has greatly advanced our understanding of ecological systems. Unfortunately, we are increasingly seeing published correlations between population indicators and environmental indices breaking down when tested with new data. Examining how the correlations among indices change over time could help explain underlying causal mechanisms, which ultimately strengthen the basis for prediction of population indicators. For migratory animals such as anadromous salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), the habitat conditions they experience can affect their lifetime fitness and population viability. We analyzed 43 freshwater, marine, and climate indices associated with 72 river sites and five coastal ecoregions inhabited by Chinook and coho salmon (O. tshawytscha and O. kisutch) in the western USA. Utilizing long time series (ranging from 32 to 124 years), we examined spatial and temporal patterns in correlations through hierarchical clustering across sites and non-stationarity across time. Individual river sites clustered into two Northwest and one Southwest groups. Northwest sites generally showed stronger correlations between freshwater and climate indices, while Southwest sites showed stronger correlations within freshwater or within marine/climate indices. For a closer examination at shorter periods, we parsed the time series into 10-year windows and showed how pairwise correlations changed over time with spring-summer Pacific Decadal Oscillation index in the Northwest and with spring flow in the Southwest. Stronger correlations across multiple indices tended to occur when large-scale climatic events (e.g., Oceanic Nino and Pacific Decadal Oscillation indices) were in-phase, and phase transitions (e.g., from positive to negative) occurred in the same 10-year window. In a third analysis, we assessed how well indices provided unique vs. confounding/complex information and had consistent vs. varying relationships based on the mean and variance of 10-year correlations. Across index types, the variance in correlations tended to be lowest in marine vs. climate indices, higher among freshwater indices, and highest for freshwater vs. marine/climate indices. Yet, the mean strength of correlations for freshwater vs. marine/climate indices was still comparable to those among freshwater ones. Overall, identifying time periods when correlations tend to change will help interpret historical and projected population indicators. Spatial trends in the strength of correlations also indicate that the level of confounding effects among indices can differ regionally. We emphasize the importance of knowing the strength and variability of correlations among indices, and their representativeness of ecological processes in the context of combined phases of multiple climatic indices.

AB  - Fertile soil is fundamental to our ability to achieve food security, but problems with soil degradation (such as acidification) are exacerbated by poormanagement. Consequently, there is a need to better understand management approaches that deliver multiple ecosystem services from agricultural land. There is global interest in sustainable soil management including the re-evaluation of existing management practices. Liming is a long established practice to ameliorate acidic soils and many liming-induced changes are well understood. For instance, short-termliming impacts are detected on soil biota and in soil biological processes (such as in N cycling where liming can increase N availability for plant uptake). The impacts of liming on soil carbon storage are variable and strongly relate to soil type, land use, climate and multiple management factors. Liming influences all elements in soils and as such there are numerous simultaneous changes to soil processes which in turn affect the plant nutrient uptake; two examples of positive impact for crops are increased P availability and decreased uptake of toxic heavy metals. Soil physical conditions are at least maintained or improved by liming, but the time taken to detect change varies significantly. Arable crops differ in their sensitivity to soil pH and for most crops there is a positive yield response. Liming also introduces implications for the development of different crop diseases and liming management is adjusted according to crop type within a given rotation. Repeated lime applications tend to improve grassland biomass production, although grassland response is variable and indirect as it relates to changes in nutrient availability. Other indicators of liming response in grassland are detected in mineral content and herbage qualitywhich have implications for livestock-based production systems. Ecological studies have shown positive impacts of liming on biodiversity; such as increased earthworm abundance that provides habitat for wading birds in upland grasslands. Finally, understanding of liming impacts on soil and crop processes are explored together with functional aspects (in terms of ecosystems services) in a new qualitative framework that includes consideration of howliming impacts change with time. This holistic approach provides insights into the far-reaching impacts that liming has on ecosystems and the potential for liming to enhance the multiple benefits from agriculturally managed land. Recommendations are given for future research on the impact of liming and the implications for ecosystem services. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose The environmental and economic impacts of livestock production systems are typically assessed using global characterisation factors and data, even though several impact categories call for site-specific assessments. Here, we account for spatial variability by addressing potential interactions between geographic locality and the cost-effectiveness of farm investments that aim to reduce system environmental impact, using Danish pig production as a case-in-point. Methods An LCA-based, spatially explicit environmental abatement cost framework was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of potential environmental abatement strategies. The framework was tested for Danish pig production in a "4 manure management x 4 geographic location" scenario analysis design. In addition to the baseline, the alternative manure management strategies were on-farm anaerobic digestion, slurry acidification and screw press slurry separation, implemented in an integrated pig farming system. The geographic locations differed in their proximity to Natura 2000 areas and in pig farming density. Eight different impact categories were assessed through an LCA using spatially explicit characterisation factors whenever possible, and annualised abatement potential was estimated for each manure management scenario and in each geographic location. We also estimated the financial performance for each scenario, through a discounted cash flow analysis at a whole-farm level. Results and discussion We observed significant interactions between geographic location and system environmental and economic performance under baseline conditions. Significant location effects were also observed for the cost-effectiveness of all manure management strategies tested. Anaerobic digestion was the only "win-win" strategy that increased farm profits while reducing system environmental impact in two of the geographic cases: when implemented in a region of high pig farming density located near Natura 2000 and when implemented in a region of high pig farming density located far from Natura 2000 areas. Slurry acidification and slurry separation achieved sizeable abatement potential for impacts on ecosystem quality but incurred large additional costs in all geographic case studies considered, particularly when arable land was limited near the pig farm. Conclusions Accounting for basic spatial characteristics within an environmental abatement cost framework had significant impact on the cost-effectiveness of on-farm investments for mitigation of system environmental impact. To the best of our knowledge, no studies to date have utilised such spatial characteristics within environmental abatement cost modelling of livestock farming systems. The presented framework has the potential to be further expanded using more detailed spatial, economic and geophysical data, which could ultimately improve decision-making regarding cost-effective investments that aim to improve the sustainability of livestock farming operations.

AB  - In ecological restoration, one of the main challenges is to develop new methods, techniques, and incentives that both favour and reduce maintenance costs in restoration projects. Besides, post-planting maintenance is often neglected hampering seedling survival over time owing to alien grasses, which compete strongly with native plants for resources. To solve these issues, recently, an innovative technology called Nucleario has been developed in Brazil. Aiming to hinder alien competition filters, the Nucleario also attempts to condition a better microenvironment, reducing drought stress through the water storage tank, decreasing temperatures, which facilitates the survival and growth of seedlings in areas under restoration. Another method used to decrease alien grasses, which is inexpensive, is seedling crowning using cardboard lowing maintenance needs in restored areas. Cardboard has similar functions to Nuclear-la, such as protecting soil against loss of water and nutrients and reducing competition with invasive exotic grasses. Therefore, comparing them also with traditional manual weeding (i.e., clean-weeded crown by hoe), we aimed to verify which technique is most cost-efficient for seedling crown maintenance of Dipteryx alata Vog., which is an indigenous tree species with high economic value owing to its nuts. We tested three techniques in areas under restoration in the Cerrado, in the Environmental Protection Area "Corrego Guariroba" located in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. We monitored seedlings submitted to the three methods in the wet and the dry periods for biotic (competition with exotic grasses, herbivory, and growth) and abiotic (moisture and soil temperature) indicators. We observed that the Nuclear-la was the treatment that maintained the highest soil moisture, resulting in a larger canopy area. However, these effects do not reflect increases in the survival rate, diameter, and height of the seedlings. None of the treatments was effective in reducing herbivory. Nuclear-la was the most effective treatment in reducing the competition of seedlings with invasive grasses. Cardboard presented an implementation value 21.5 times lower than Nuclear-la and 1.2 times than manual crowning. Given the high purchase price, the Nucleario's cost-benefit ratio was very high compared to the crowning of cardboard and the manual weeding, which discourages us from recommending it for this species with high survival rates. Its project can be revised to decrease herbivory rates, as well as its efficiency tested in the short and long term in different ecosystems and species, particularly species susceptible to water stress.

AB  - Soil quality (SQ) is the ability of soil to provide ecosystem functions and services. Implementation of a certain agricultural system can affect SQ and therefore play an essential role in achieving sustainable agriculture. The aim of this study was to explore how agricultural systems (conventional vs. organic), grazing regime (non-grazed vs. grazed) and the different proportions of temporary grass-clover leys in crop rotations (ley time proportion, LTP) affect SQ within a mixed (cropping and pasture/dairy system) commercial farming enterprise in the UK. Seven SQ indicators were evaluated, including chemical (pH; available phosphorus (P); potassium (K)), physical (bulk density, BD; aggregate stability, AS) and biological (total carbon (C); microbial biomass carbon, MBC) sectors. All SQ indicators were measured at three depth intervals (0-0.15, 0.15-0.30, 0.30-0.60 m), except for AS and MBC, which were only considered for the topsoil (0-0.15 m). The findings reflected existing knowledge on the advantages of organic vs. conventional systems for SQ indicators, with the former showing higher MBC and similar K, BD, AS and C in the 0-0.30-m compared to the latter. Lower topsoil available P in organic systems can be related to the lack of measurements in all P pools. When grazing was included: (a) both agricultural systems showed higher topsoil available P, C and MBC; and (b) there was a higher topsoil K in organic systems, whereas it positively affected topsoil BD and C (0.15-0.30 m) in conventional systems. Increasing LTP to 30-40% of the full crop rotation increased topsoil AS and C (0-0.30 m) in a linear fashion. Subsoil conditions (>0.30 m) favoured K, BD and C in conventional systems, but these results should be considered carefully. It was concluded that both organic and conventional systems delivered similar levels of SQ and that reviving mixed farming systems may be a key factor for delivering multifunctional agroecosystems that maintain SQ and optimize ecosystem services. Highlights
   Single-farm comparison of top- and subsoil quality in organic and non-organic systems. The organic system increased microbial biomass carbon but decreased topsoil available phosphorus. Grazing increased topsoil available phosphorus, carbon concentration and microbial biomass carbon. Temporary leys in rotations increased topsoil aggregate stability and carbon concentration. Mixed farming is a key factor for delivering multifunctional agroecosystems.

AB  - Variable retention mitigates harmful effects of traditional practices on biodiversity of forest ecosystems, preserving habitats for species affiliated with closed forests and providing habitats for early-seral species. In Nothofagus pumilio forests variable retention effects on several taxa have been actively monitored in short- and medium-terms. However, these have rarely been investigated further than six years since harvesting, seldom considering multiple taxonomic groups in the same research. Furthermore, there is a lack of information about responses along the regional gradient of a forest natural distribution. We evaluated the effect of variable retention on plant and beetle assemblages, seven to eleven years after harvesting, in three locations along a regional gradient of the natural distribution of N. pumilio forest in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina.
   We surveyed three silvicultural treatments (aggregated retention-AR, dispersed retention-DR, old growth forests-OGF) at three localities, where we characterized understory vascular plant and beetle communities during mid-summer by species richness, abundance, Shannon-Wiener diversity and Pielou evenness indices, as well as community structure. We found 58 plants and 45 species of beetles. Assemblages of old growth forests showed differences among the three locations along the studied regional gradient, with only 25% of plants and one beetle shared among them. Plant distribution may be driven by microclimatic and geographical conditions, while availability of food resources or habitat structural complexity could influence beetles. Likewise, variable retention modified original assemblages with greater effects in DR than in AR. However, this trend was not uniform for each taxa or locality, and seems to be related to the composition of original assemblages and the influx of species from surrounding environments. The specialist vs. generalist quantities in the original assemblage could influence the resistance/resilience of the community, since old growth assemblages with a greater proportion of generalist and/or non-sensitive species could maintain more similarity between aggregates and old growth forest. The influx of species (mainly generalists or exploiters) occurred mainly in DR, generating higher dissimilarities between DR and OGF. The, correlation between taxa was not so clear for all locations; therefore, retention effects cannot be generalized among taxa and localities. Finally, the utility of potential bioindicators in the whole region could differ for a particular locality, and vice versa. Particularities in the biotic assemblages of different taxa in a regional gradient are important for management and conservation planning, and support variable retention as a useful strategy to combine conservation and production objectives in a managed landscape.

AB  - number of archaeologists have suggested that significant climatic change with environmental and social consequences occurred between 1000 and 400 years ago in the Indo-Pacific region. We investigate this premise by examining the archaeological record of changes in hunter-gatherer economies in three geographically distinct coastal regions of tropical northern Australia. These case studies support the argument that Aboriginal mollusc exploitation reflects the altered local ecological habitats that accompanied broader coastal environmental change over the last few thousand years. Overlap between the phases and timing of climatic and behavioural changes within each region suggests that, given regional variation in the nature and of these changes, there was an associated human response to late Holocene climatic variability.
   These case studies establish that archaeological and environmental evidence mutually support the argument for climate change influencing cultural change in northern Australia. We suggest that, while a direct physical link between environmental change and the interpretations of significant cultural change in the archaeological record have yet to be demonstrated unambiguously in this region, the analysis of mollusc exploitation has the potential to provide the direct link that is currently missing between changes in climate, environment and human responses over the last millennium.
   Archaeological sites have the potential to act as archives that record significant information on palaeoclimatic conditions to augment standard pollen and coral core palaeoclimate indicators (Sandweiss 2003). This becomes particularly useful in areas where few standard palaeoenvironmental studies exist, as is the case for the tropical north Australian coast, especially for the Late Holocene period. Some archaeologists argue that, in the Indo-Pacific region, significant climatic change between 1000 and 400 years ago had considerable environmental and social consequences. Most of these studies have dealt with horticulturalist societies, however, and the impact on hunter gatherer societies is less-well studied (cf. Haberle and David 2004).
   In tropical north Australia, radiometric dating indicates that substantial changes occurred in the shell-fishing practices of hunter-gatherer groups after approximately 1000 calibrated years ago (Bourke 2003, 2004; Brockwell et al. 2005; Faulkner 2006; Faulkner and Clarke 2004; Hiscock 1997, 1999). This paper presents an over-view of the archaeological record of changes in hunter-gatherer economic and social practices in three geographically distinct regions of tropical northern Australia (Figure 1). This is done so within the context of what is known of significant phases of climate change in order to explore the relationship between human behaviour and climate change in the late Holocene.

AB  - Our social life has a significant impact on landscapes through complex mechanisms. The authors believe that governmental ideas, development policies, institutionalised structures, and our interests and activities manifest themselves in various units. Cultural landscapes reflect society's relationship with the environment. Thus, the processes related to the use of landscapes, i.e. "landscape production", can be seen as indicators of the "new environmental paradigm". (The new environmental paradigm represents a "workiview" and an era in which nature conservation and environmental protection become the ultimate goal)
   To better understand these processes - based on critical, structuralist approaches, qualitative and quantitative GIS analyses - we focus on land use conversions and the social driving forces and responses behind land use patterns. We try to show how nature conservation and agriculture have played a major role in landscape management, shaping the character of the Hungarian lowland regions, and to identify what have been the decisive moments of each epoch in the last 50 years.
   In addition, we examine how the actors in these sectors value the ecological aspects and the importance of agriculture, as well as the interventions affecting them. Using the examples of the areas of Kunsag and Bacska (differently influenced by nature conservation), we also want to investigate the conflicts and dilemmas of nature conservation and agriculture in the Danube-Tisza interfluve.
   The results show that efforts to strengthen the new paradigm are hampered by different social interests. Although environmental principles have emerged, there has been no comprehensive improvement in landscape management or landscape condition in recent decades. Based on the historical events studied using primary data and statistical analyses, it can be seen that the attitudes of society and the conflicting needs of land use play a crucial role in land use change and landscape production.
   The new directions of ecological thinking and some elements of the new environmental paradigm appeared in the last five decades. These directions manifested themselves in the segments influencing land use, i.e. in both agriculture and nature conservation. It is also striking that ecological principles have been integrated late and inefficiently into decision-making mechanisms, landscape development practices and rural planning.
   The agro-environmental and NATURA2000 schemes have facilitated cooperation between nature conservation and agriculture, but are based on subsidies rather than on producer awareness. Our views are in line with our respondent? comments that sustainable nature conservation should not be subordinated to economic objectives, but at the same time, national parks must also accept the rationalisation of farming practices.

AB  - Impervious surface area (ISA) is considered as an indicator of environment change and is regarded as an important input parameter for hydrological cycle simulation, water management and area pollution assessment. The Pearl River Delta (PRD), the 3rd most important economic district of China, is chosen in this paper to extract the ISA information based on Landsat images of 1998, 2003 and 2008 by using a linear spectral un-mixing method and to monitor impervious surface change by analyzing the multi-temporal Landsat-derived fractional impervious surface. Results of this study were as follows: (1) the area of ISA in the PRD increased 79.09% from 1998 to 2003 and 26.88% from 2003 to 2008 separately; (2) the spatial distribution of ISA was described according to the 1998/2003 percentage respectively. Most of middle and high percentage ISA was located in northwestern and southeastern of the whole delta, and middle percentage ISA was mainly located in the city interior, high percentage ISA was mainly located in the suburban around the city accordingly; (3) the expanding direction and trend of high percentage ISA was discussed in order to understand the change of urban in this delta; High percentage ISA moved from inner city to edge of urban area during 1998-2003 and moved to the suburban area that far from the urban area mixed with jumpily and gradually during 2003-2008. According to the discussion of high percentage ISA spatial expanded direction, it could be found out that high percentage ISA moved outward from the centre line of Pearl River of the whole delta while a high ISA percentage in both shores of the Pearl River Estuary moved toward the Pearl River; (4) combining the change of ISA with social conditions, the driving relationship was analyzed in detail. It was evident that ISA percentage change had a deep relationship with the economic development of this region in the past ten years. Contemporaneous major sport events (16th Asia Games of Guangzhou, 26th Summer Universidad of Shenzhen) and the government policies also promoted the development of the ISA. Meanwhile, topographical features like the National Nature Reserve of China restricted and affected the expansion of the ISA. Above all, this paper attempted to extract ISA in a major region of the PRD; the temporal and spatial analyses to PRD ISA demonstrated the drastic changes in developed areas of China. These results were important and valuable for land use management, ecological protection and policy establishment.

AB  - The presence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the aquatic environment has raised concern that chronic exposure to these compounds may cause adverse effects in wild fish populations. This potential scenario has led some stakeholders to advocate a stricter regulation of NSAIDs, especially diclofenac. Considering their global clinical importance for the management of pain and inflammation, any regulation that may affect patient access to NSAIDs will have considerable implications for public health. The current environmental risk assessment of NSAIDs is driven by the results of a limited number of standard toxicity tests and does not take into account mechanistic and pharmacological considerations. Here we present a pharmacology-informed framework that enables the prediction of the risk posed to fish by 25 different NSAIDs and their dynamic mixtures. Using network pharmacology approaches, we demonstrated that these 25 NSAIDs display a significant mechanistic promiscuity that could enhance the risk of target-mediated mixture effects near environmentally relevant concentrations. Integrating NSAIDs pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features, we provide highly specific predictions of the adverse phenotypes associated with exposure to NSAIDs, and we developed a visual multi-scale model to guide the interpretation of the toxicological relevance of any given set of NSAIDs exposure data. Our analysis demonstrated a non-negligible risk posed to fish by NSAID mixtures in situations of high drug use and low dilution of waste-water treatment plant effluents. We anticipate that this predictive framework will support the future regulatory environmental risk assessment of NSAIDs and increase the effectiveness of ecopharmacovigilance strategies. Moreover, it can facilitate the prediction of the toxicological risk posed by mixtures via the implementation of mechanistic considerations and could be readily extended to other classes of chemicals.

AB  - Spatial and temporal changes in land cover have direct impacts on the hydrological cycle and stream quality. Techniques for accurately and efficiently mapping these changes are evolving quickly, and it is important to evaluate how useful these techniques are to address the environmental impact of land cover on riparian buffer areas. The objectives of this study were to: (1) determine the classes and distribution of land cover in the riparian areas of streams; (2) examine the discrepancies within the existing land cover data from National Land Cover Database (NLCD) using high-resolution imagery of the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) and a LiDAR canopy height model; and (3) develop a technique using LiDAR data to help characterize riparian buffers over large spatial extents. One-meter canopy height models were constructed in a high-throughput computing environment. The machine learning algorithm Support Vector Machine (SVM) was trained to perform supervised land cover classification at a 1-m resolution on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform using NAIP imagery and LiDAR-derived canopy height models. This integrated approach to land cover classification provided a substantial improvement in the resolution and accuracy of classifications with F1 Score of each land cover classification ranging from 64.88 to 95.32%. The resulting 1-m land cover map is a highly detailed representation of land cover in the study area. Forests (evergreen and deciduous) and wetlands are by far the dominant land cover classes in riparian zones of the Lower Savannah River Basin, followed by cultivated crops and pasture/hay. Stress from urbanization in the riparian zones appears to be localized. This study demonstrates a method to create accurate high-resolution riparian buffer maps which can be used to improve water management and provide future prospects for improving buffer zones monitoring to assess stream health.

AB  - Anisakid nematodes have complex life-cycles that include invertebrate and vertebrate hosts at various levels of the marine food chain. Different types of habitat disturbances of the marine ecosystem (pollution, overfishing, by-catch) could impoverish the host population size, resulting in concomitant and detrimental effects on parasitic nematode populations. This in turn would lead to the loss of genetic diversity of these parasites at both the species and population levels. In order to test for a correlation existing between the genetic diversity of anisakid nematodes and habitat disturbance, the genetic variability, estimated by nuclear markers (19 allozyme loci), was evaluated among several anisakid populations from fish and marine mammals in various areas of the Boreal and Austral regions. Antarctic and sub-antarctic populations showed significantly (P < 0.001) higher levels of genetic diversity (on average, He = 0.23) than those from the Arctic and sub-Arctic populations and species (on average, He = 0.07). Correlations between the decree of genetic variability and the levels of parasitic infections within their hosts were considered. Data revealed higher intensities in anisakid infections in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic hosts, presumably resulting from a lower degree of habitat disturbance in less stressed areas. The absence of disturbance presumably allowed anisakid species to reach a larger population size, with a reduced probability of genetic drift in their gene pools. This suggests that anisakid nematodes, and their levels of genetic diversity may be suitable indicators of the integrity of marine food webs and of the general biodiversity of a marine ecosystem.

AB  - Assimilable organic carbon (AOC) is an important indicator of the biological stability of reclaimed water. In this study, a new rapid and more stable method for AOC measurement in reclaimed water was proposed. Indigenous microbial culture from secondary effluent was used as the inoculum, and bacterial growth was determined by the quantity of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the form of luminescence instead of plate count. ATP luminescence had a high correlation with biogrowth both in pure acetate solutions and reclaimed waters. ATP luminescence analysis could be determined in 5 min. Three days of 10000 cells/mL inoculum incubated at 25 degrees C were enough for the bacteria to reach the stationary phase. The good correlations between ATP luminescence and the added acetate-C concentration illustrated the applicability of monitoring AOC level by luminescence method. And in reclaimed water samples, indigenous microbial culture produces the highest AOC results compared with the pure strains. This indicated that the integrity of indigenous microbial culture ensured the full utilization of matrix carbons, which demonstrated the advantage of indigenous microbial culture compared with the selected pure bacteria in the traditional AOC test. The average ATP content per cell of 3.95 x 10(-10) nmol/cell was derived, and this value was stable in both the acetate solutions and reclaimed waters. Furthermore, the average yield coefficient of 1.5 x 10(5) RLU/mu g acetate-C (4.1 x 10(-3) nmol ATP/mu g acetate-C) was obtained from, different indigenous cultures. Additionally, the indigenous microbial cultures from different secondary effluents would produce the similar AOC results for the same water sample, indicating the consistency of this assay. The ATP luminescence-AOC assay provides a faster, more stable and accurate approach for monitoring the biological stability of reclaimed waters. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: This paper looks at the barriers to effective postgraduate study potentially experienced by learners in the United Kingdom if their first language is not English. As part of the internationalisation of higher education, we are seeing a welcome increase in students leaving their home country to study. This brings benefits to both home and visiting students as they learn more about each other and come to understand differences and build on aspects they have in common. However it also brings specific challenges of linguistic capability, differences in cultural expectations of the role of learners and teachers and in the understanding of the nature of postgraduate study. English medium higher education institutions worldwide are increasingly engaged in development of courses on English for academic purposes, or for academic writing. There is even a Journal of English for Academic Purposes, with co-editors from Hong Kong and the UK. Previous research has tended to concentrate on teacher-centred issues such as maintaining the integrity of assessments (including a focus on inadvertent plagiarism), practical aspects such as familiarity and expertise with information technology and more recently an understanding that acculturation has a part to play in maximising the success of students moving from one country's academic model to another. Materials amd Methods: This was a qualitative project during which students whose first language was not English were interviewed. Thirteen postgraduate students on a masters award in medical education were engaged in semi structured interviews to elicit their experiences, views and suggestions. Results: Three themes emerged as important to the students in this study: understanding and being understood is not just due to the words we use; the nature of postgraduate study is not universal; and the need to maintain personal identity.

AB  - The increased availability of publicly available data is, in many ways, changing our approach to conducting research. Not only are cloud-based information resources providing supplementary data to bolster traditional scientific activities (e.g., field studies, laboratory experiments), they also serve as the foundation for secondary data research projects such as indicator development. Indicators and indices are a convenient way to synthesize disparate information to address complex scientific questions that are difficult to measure directly (e.g., resilience, sustainability, well-being). In the current literature, there is no shortage of indicator or index examples derived from secondary data with a growing number that are scientifically focused. However, little information is provided describing the management approaches and best practices used to govern the data underpinnings supporting these efforts. From acquisition to storage and maintenance, secondary data research products rely on the availability of relevant, high-quality data, repeatable data handling methods and a multi-faceted data flow process to promote and sustain research transparency and integrity. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently published a report describing the development of a climate resilience screening index which used over one million data points to calculate the final index. The pool of data was derived exclusively from secondary sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Postal Service, Housing and Urban Development, Forestry Services and others. Available data were presented in various forms including portable document format (PDF), delimited ASCII and proprietary format (e.g., Microsoft Excel, ESRI ArcGIS). The strategy employed for managing these data in an indicator research and development effort represented a blend of business practices, information science, and the scientific method. This paper describes the approach, highlighting key points unique for managing the data assets of a small-scale research project in an era of "big data."

The distribution of wood residues and lignin in the studied sedimentary formation is very uneven, which reflects the dynamic flux environment of sedimentation and OM supply. The calculated molecular indexes showed that most of the OM in deposits underwent insignificant diagenetic alterations.

AB  - In the traditional ecosystem service evaluation, non-material services such as culture and recreation services are difficult to accurately quantify due to the lack of a powerful evaluation model. Compared with ecosystem services, landscape services emphasize all the tangible and intangible services that landscape ecosystems provide to humans in the spatial pattern. Social media photos can be used for perceived services demand evaluation on the landscape scale. The study of spatial relationship between recreation service demand (RSD) and urbanization complements the integrity of the landscape service supply and demand relationship framework. Firstly, this paper analyzes the spatial autocorrelation and seasonal differences of landscape recreation service demand through Global Moran's I. The analysis shows that there is a highly significant spatial agglomeration and certain seasonal differences in landscape recreation service demand. Secondly, the bivariate Global Moran's I is used to analyze spatial correlation between landscape recreation service demand and urbanization, The result shows that there is a positive spatial correlation between urbanization indicators and landscape recreation service demand in different seasons. Thirdly, the bivariate LISA method is used to show the spatial agglomeration relationship between landscape recreation service demand and urbanization indicators in different seasons. Finally, it is verified that the spatial lag model and the spatial error model are more suitable for measuring the dependence than the linear regression least squares (OLS). At the same time, population density (PD) has a positive impact on landscape recreation service demand in different seasons, while landscape recreation service demand in autumn is also positively affected by non-urbanization factors and negative impact of GDP, which also proves space spillover effect between landscape recreation service demand and urbanization. The above conclusions can be used as important information for urban landscape planning and decision-making.

AB  - It is widely known that the wavelet coefficients of natural scenes possess certain statistical regularities which can be affected by the presence of distortions. The DIIVINE (Distortion Identification-based Image Verity and Integrity Evaluation) algorithm is a successful no-reference image quality assessment (NR IQA) algorithm, which estimates quality based on changes in these regularities. However, DIIVINE operates based on real-valued wavelet coefficients, whereas the visual appearance of an image can be strongly determined by both the magnitude and phase information.
   In this paper, we present a complex extension of the DIIVINE algorithm (called C-DIIVINE), which blindly assesses image quality based on the complex Gaussian scale mixture model corresponding to the complex version of the steerable pyramid wavelet transform. Specifically, we applied three commonly used distribution models to fit the statistics of the wavelet coefficients: (1) the complex generalized Gaussian distribution is used to model the wavelet coefficient magnitudes, (2) the generalized Gaussian distribution is used to model the coefficients' relative magnitudes, and (3) the wrapped Cauchy distribution is used to model the coefficients' relative phases. All these distributions have characteristic shapes that are consistent across different natural images but change significantly in the presence of distortions. We also employ the complex wavelet structural similarity index to measure degradation of the correlations across image scales, which serves as an important indicator of the subbands' energy distribution and the loss of alignment of local spectral components contributing to image structure. Experimental results show that these complex extensions allow C-DIIVINE to yield a substantial improvement in predictive performance as compared to its predecessor, and highly competitive performance relative to other recent no-reference algorithms.

AB  - 4-Nitrophenol (PNP) has deleterious effects on mammalian physiological functions. The objective of the study is to identify the effect of 4-Nitrophenol on male mice reproductive function. About 50 adult Kunming male mice (25-30 g) were randomly divided into 5 groups, administrated (0.1, 10 and 100 mg kgwt(-1)) orally for 35 days. Semen quality, histological structure of testis and ultrastructure of primary spermatocytes were detected to analysis effect of PNP on the spermatogenesis function. Furthermore, the functions of liver and kidney were determined by testing the blood of biological indicators. The results showed that 0.1 mg kgwt(-1) PNP decreased slightly in body weight (p>0.05) but significantly reduced and rogen hormone-sentitive organ weights (p<0.05). However, semen quality (total sperm count, survival, linear motion and acrosome integrity rate), liver function (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total protein and plasma albumin (p>0.05) and renal function (urea, uric acid and creatinine had no significant changes (p>0.05); 10 and 100 mg kgwt(-1) PNP reduced not only significantly body weight, androgen hormone-sensitive organ weights (p<0.05) but also significantly reduced semen quality, liver and renal function and the effect of 100 mg kgwt(-1) PNP was stronger than that of 10 mg kgwt(-1) PNP (p<0.05); three does of PNP on the testicular structure and ultra structure of primary spermatocytes had injury effect. With increasing concentrations of PNP, the damage was enchaced. About 100 mg kgwt(-1) PNP significantly disrupted testicular structure and ultra structure of the primary spermatocytes. This shows that PNP affects the liver and kidney detoxification function which reduced the detoxification ability of body and damages the process of spermatogenesis.

AB  - The Great Basin Pocket Mouse (Perognathus parvus) and Western Harvest Mouse (Reithrodontomys megatons) are two peripheral species occurring in the southern Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, Canada. Both species are listed as vulnerable to extirpation because of habitat loss, primarily due to conversion of natural habitat to agricultural uses and suburban expansion. Population dynamics of these two species were studied in three habitat types: old field, sagebrush, and pine forest. The Great Basin Pocket Mouse occurred at densities ranging from 12 to 28/ha in sagebrush habitats and at 2-8/ha in old fields and Ponderosa Pine forest. The Western Harvest Mouse occurred at variable densities up to 10/ha in old fields and up to 5/ha in sagebrush habitats. Mean number of lactating females for Great Basin Pocket Mice ranged from 4-8 in sagebrush, 1-5 in old fields and pine forests combined. Mean juvenile survival to adulthood ranged from 3.28 young Great Basin Pocket Mice per pregnant female in sagebrush, 4.67 in old field, and 1.82 in pine forest habitats. Mean juvenile survival to adulthood of Western Harvest Mice ranged from 1.46-1.72 young per female in old field and sagebrush habitats. Conservation of habitat features (high biomass and structural diversity of grasses and forbs) in linear habitats has the potential to maintain populations of Western Harvest Mice. The Great Basin Pocket Mouse needs features of sagebrush and old field habitats that need to be conserved as natural non-linear components in mosaics of natural and anthropogenic habitats. Both species could act as "indicators" of habitat integrity for a wide range of other vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant species in the Okanagan Valley.

AB  - Neurons and glia within the hippocampus of aged, spatial learning-impaired Long-Evans rats exhibit uniquely altered gene expression profiles, and we have postulated oxidative stress as the basis for this. To test this hypothesis we quantitated the extent of protein and nucleic acid oxidative damage, evaluated the status of mitochondrial DNA integrity, and examined several signaling entities and molecular indicators frequently associated with oxidative stress and gliosis.
   Immunoblotting demonstrated elevated heme oxygenase-1 in the aged-impaired hippocampus and immunocytochemistry suggested that heme oxygenase-1 is largely cytosolic and at least partly neuronal in nature. In the aged-impaired group. immunoreactivity to 9-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. an oxidative nucleic acid adduct, was found to be elevated in the dentate gyrus and in area CAI of the hippocampal formation. Isolated mitochondrial DNA was found to be significantly damaged in the aged-impaired group. In the aged learning-impaired rats only, proteins in a 65-kDa band were found to contain excessive levels of carbonyl residues. Glial activation was examined by in situ hybridization histochemistry to tumor necrosis factor alpha and by immunocytochemistry with OX-6, which detects activated microglia. White matter in aged brains exhibited a modest up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA and OX-6 immunoreactivity, but the hippocampal formation expressed tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA equivalent to young animals and few OX-6-positive microglia. The mRNA for manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase, which is elevated in the aged hippocampus, was found preferentially expressed in neurons.
   We conclude that aged hippocampal neurons appear to be under oxidative stress and this is more severe in the learning-impaired subjects, suggesting a possible basis for age-induced cognitive decline. (C) 2001 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abandoned lands previously used for agricultural purposes may constitute an opportunity for understanding the variables involved in the restoration of native ecosystems over time. In this study, we assessed the functional status of an abandoned farmland currently used for conservation, using a methodology based on indicators of landscape organization and soil surface. We analyzed changes in plant cover, patch and interpatches structure and several soil surface properties during two periods of land abandonment (less and more than 40 years). Using this methodology, we characterize the potential of the ecosystem to capture and transfer resources, and the state of functional properties such as infiltration capacity, soil stability and nutrient cycling.
   We detected a significant development of the shrub layer and an increase of the number, type and area occupied by vegetated patches in old fields. The contribution of vegetated patches to the recovery of stability, infiltration and nutrient functions was significant at the local scale. Nonetheless, when analyzing the landscape as a whole only the nutrient cycling index was significantly higher in old fields. The lack of improvement of the stability and infiltration in old fields can lead to further degradation and indicates that even though vegetation cover may have improved over time in old fields, the current cover might not be enough to prevent further degradation by erosion. Our results reinforce the importance of using functionality indexes in future studies focused on adequate restoration measures to protect the function of desert ecosystems, especially when aimed for biodiversity conservation. Hence, the use of monitoring systems based on organization and function indicators is a useful tool to represent the current state and potential recovery of previously disturbed ecosystems, provided that the time scale is taken into account.

AB  - Background: Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) infection is the most common cause of male infertility. Zhibai Dihuang Decoction (ZBDHD) can improve the rate of forwarding motility sperm, sperm deformity rate, seminal plasma zinc and refined berry sugar levels.
   Methods: The potential targets of ZBDHD are obtained from The Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine (ETCM). Orchitis-related targets were collected from the Genecards and OMIM databases. The Cytoscape and the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) were utilized to construct and analyzed the networks. Finally, a rat model of orchitis caused by UU infection was used to detect related indicators of mitochondrial energy metabolism using TUNEL apoptosis detection technology, loss cytometry, Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western Blot.
   Results: A total of 795 ZBDHD targets and 242 orchitis-related targets were obtained. The "ZBDHD- orchitis PPI network" was constructed and analyzed. ZBDHD can regulate signaling pathways and biological processes related to mitochondrial energy metabolism. The results of experimental studies have shown that ZBDHD maintains the integrity of sperm mitochondrial respiratory chain function by enhancing mitochondrial Na+-K+-ATPase and Ca2(+)-Mg2+-ATPase activities, promotes the synthesis of mitochondrial ATP, and improves sperm energy supply, thereby improving the motility, vitality and survival rate of sperm, and effectively improving the quality of semen in UU-infected rats (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion:This study discovered the multi-pathway mechanism of ZBDHD intervention in UU-induced orchitis through integrated pharmacological strategies, which provides a reference for further research on the mechanism of ZBDHD intervention in orchitis in the direction of mitochondrial energy metabolism.

AB  - The diversity of macro-invertebrates is related to the state of disturbance of the soil, caused mainly by the land-use change for agricultural activities. A strategy for the conservation of these organisms is the implementation of diversified production systems such as silvopastoral systems. However, in the Southeast of Mexico, information is still limited. The aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare the richness, abundance and composition of macro-invertebrates in four contrasting agro-ecosystems: two silvopastoral systems made of Leucaena leucocephala and associated pastures (i.e. Panicum maximum cv mombaza and Cynodon plectostachyus), a pasture of Brachiaria brizantha with scattered trees in low density and, a medium-statured tropical dry forest. In each system, an area of one hectare was delimited and a transect of 50 m in length was established in which five pit-fall traps were placed every 10 m. The sampling was carried out in February and May of 2018 and in each month five collections were made with five-day intervals. A total of 1 737 organisms belonging to 10 orders of the class Insecta and one of the class Gastropoda were collected. The medium-statured tropical dry forest (923 individuals) and the silvopastoral systems of L. leucocephala with C. Plectostachyus (354 individuals) show the highest abundance of macro-invertebrates. The most abundant genera were: Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Aracninae and Orthoptera. The higher macro-invertebrate diversity was found in the silvopastoral systems of L. leucocephala with P. maximum (H'= 1.58) and L. leucocephala with C. plectostachyus (H' = 1.44). The results show that livestock systems managed with woody components (trees or shrubs) are home of an important abundance and richness of macro-invertebrates, compared to tropical forests. This diversity of macro-invertebrates may contribute to the integrity and functionality of the agro-ecosystems.

AB  - Soil erosion associated with non-point source pollution is viewed as a process of land degradation in many terrestrial environments. Careful monitoring and assessment of land use variations with different temporal and spatial scales would reveal a fluctuating interface, punctuated by changes in rainfall and runoff, movement of people, perturbation from environmental disasters, and shifts in agricultural activities and cropping patterns. The use of multi-temporal remote sensing images in support of environmental modeling analysis in a geographic information system (GIS) environment leading to identification of a variety of long-term interactions between land, resources, and the built environment has been a highly promising approach in recent years. This paper started with a series of supervised land use classifications, using SPOT satellite imagery as a means, in the Kao-Ping River Basin, South Taiwan. Then, it was designed to differentiate the variations of eight land use patterns in the past decade, including orchard, farmland, sugarcane field, forest, grassland, barren, community, and water body. Final accuracy was confirmed based on interpretation of available aerial photographs and global positioning system (GPS) measurements. Finally, a numerical simulation model (General Watershed Loading Function, GWLF) was used to relate soil erosion to nonpoint source pollution impacts in the coupled land and river water systems. Research findings indicate that while the decadal increase in orchards poses a significant threat to water quality, the continual decrease in forested land exhibits a potential impact on water quality management. Non-point source pollution, contributing to part of the downstream water quality deterioration of the Kao-Ping River system in the last decade, has resulted in an irreversible impact on land integrity from a long-term perspective.

AB  - Fiber-reinforced plastic is one of the top priorities lightweight materials with excellent mechanical properties for the aerospace industries in recent years. However, it is difficult to machine despite having unique properties due to its non-homogeneous and abrasive nature in alternate fiber and matrix layers. Thus, it is found to be a challenging task to drill hole on such hard-to-machine materials, which is highly essential for the development of most of the engineering structural components. The present work addresses various drilling-induced defects such as delamination, circularity error, and roughness variations in the hole surface during drilling of quasi-isotropic cross-fiber oriented bi-directional woven-type carbon fiber reinforced plastic laminate using a full factorial design of experiments for different drill geometry. The response surface methodology was considered for the regression model development, which was found to be highly significant. The machining forces with associated torque have also been acquired during drilling, which was divided and further analyzed in time domain to correlate with drilling flaws. The drilling-induced delamination was found to be higher at a high feed rate using a higher drill point angle due to substantial thrust force generation at the initial stages in the drilling cycle. However, the internal surface finish with associated circularity error was reduced for higher spindle speed with less feed rate using a low drill point angle because of low torque fluctuation at the final drilling phases. The axial thrust force was found to be a prime indicator of drilled hole surface delamination, whereas drilling torque precisely indicated internal surface roughness as well as circularity error. The global root mean square, along with a local peak of thrust and torque, both were highly essential to completely characterize the drilled hole quality.

AB  - One of the forest types occurring in Southern Brazil is the Mixed Ombrophilous Forest (MOF), a subtype of the Atlantic Forest and one of the biodiversity hotspots on Earth. We sampled adult Odonata at 30 locations in the Floresta Nacional de Sao Francisco de Paula (FLONA-SFP), Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, a national reserve which is divided into several sectors of MOF, planted Araucaria angustifolia, Pinus elliottii used for sustainable and financial purposes, and open fields. There are three types of aquatic environments in the reserve: lakes, swamps, and rivers/streams. Our aim was to obtain an overview of the species' distribution patterns in the three types of aquatic environments and to evaluate the species occurring in lakes, an exclusively man-made habitat in this area. We recorded 46 species from seven odonate families; 25 species ((x) over bar = 5.71 +/- 1.77 SD) occurring in rivers/streams, 24 in lakes (11.57 +/- 2.15) and 21 in swamps (5.22 +/- 3.60). Using Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NmDS), we showed that the species composition differed clearly between the three types of aquatic habitats. While swamps and rivers/streams had a relatively similar and uniform species composition, species in the lakes were more varied but the total species number was almost as high as that of the rivers/streams. The lake communities also differed distinctly from those of the other habitats, and we assume that the lake species originate from other degraded areas in the vicinity, indicating that the remains of the Atlantic Forest has already been strongly altered by humans. Given the poor knowledge of the Odonata in the Atlantic Forest/MOF, we hope that our study may increase the understanding of the communities, and contribute to the development of conservation measures for this fragmented biome.

AB  - Human land cover can degrade estuaries directly through habitat loss and fragmentation or indirectly through nutrient inputs that reduce water quality. Strong precipitation events are occurring more frequently, causing greater hydrological connectivity between watersheds and estuaries. Nutrient enrichment and dissolved oxygen depletion that occur following these events are known to limit populations of benthic macroinvertebrates and commercially harvested species, but the consequences for top consumers such as birds remain largely unknown. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) and structural equation modeling (SEM) to understand how land cover and annual variation in rainfall interact to shape waterbird community composition in Chesapeake Bay, USA. The MDS ordination indicated that urban subestuaries shifted from a mixed generalist-specialist community in 2002, a year of severe drought, to generalist-dominated community in 2003, of year of high rainfall. The SEM revealed that this change was concurrent with a sixfold increase in nitrate-N concentration in subestuaries. In the drought year of 2002, waterbird community composition depended only on the direct effect of urban development in watersheds. In the wet year of 2003, community composition depended both on this direct effect and on indirect effects associated with high nitrate-N inputs to northern parts of the Bay, particularly in urban subestuaries. Our findings suggest that increased runoff during periods of high rainfall can depress water quality enough to alter the composition of estuarine waterbird communities, and that this effect is compounded in subestuaries dominated by urban development. Estuarine restoration programs often chart progress by monitoring stressors and indicators, but rarely assess multivariate relationships among them. Estuarine management planning could be improved by tracking the structure of relationships among land cover, water quality, and waterbirds. Unraveling these complex relationships may help managers identify and mitigate ecological thresholds that occur with increasing human land cover.

AB  - The influence of the proximity of Urbanization and agriculture to stream water quality is often difficult to quantify. The objectives Of this Study were to (1) compare the influence of far-field land-use, encompassing a watershed drainage area, to a near-field, 200-m buffer on each side of the stream in an attempt to determine on which zone of influence land-use has the largest impact on water quality, and (2) incorporate the EPA's Rapid Habitat Assessment Protocol (Barbour et al., 1999) to characterize the riparian and channel characteristics of a stream that influence water quality, which can improve New York State's monitoring protocols. Impacts were assessed through biological, chemical, and physical-habitat data from 29 streams located within a variety of land-use categories. Land-use was identified through USGS National Land Cover Data (NLCD). Principal components analysis (PCA) indicated that land-use and water quality variables were associated with non-point source contaminants (e.g. nutrients and specific conductance). Using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, significant relationships between all three land-use types and stream water quality were determined at the 200-m buffer zone of influence. At the watershed zone of influence, water quality indicators did not correlate significantly with land cover type. DO and BAP values within the 200-m buffer zone varied inversely with the percentage of Urban-land cover. The stronger correlation between land cover and stream water quality at the 200-m proximity than that of the watershed suggests that the presence of a riparian buffer zone between streams and agricultural and urban areas is a significant factor in reducing contamination from non-point Source loading.

AB  - Background
   Heat stress has negative effects on the intestinal health of humans and animals. However, the impact of heat stress on intestinal microbial and metabolic changes remains elusive. Here, we investigated the cecal microbial and metabolic profiles in mice in response to heat stress.
   Methods
   The mouse heat stress model was constructed by simulating a high-temperature environment. Twenty mice were randomly assigned to two groups, the control group (CON, 25 degrees C) and the heat treatment group (HS, 40 degrees C from 13:00 to 15:00 every day for 7 days). Serum and cecal contents were collected from the mice for serum biochemical analysis, 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing, and non-targeted metabolomics.
   Results
   Both core body temperature and water intake were significantly increased in the HS group. Serum biochemical indicators were also affected, including significantly increased triglyceride and decreased low-density lipoprotein in the heat stress group. The composition and structure of intestinal microbiota were remarkably altered in the HS group. At the species level, the relative abundance of Candidatus Arthromitus sp. SFB-mouse-Japan and Lactobacillus murinus significantly reduced, while that of Lachnospiraceae bacterium 3-1 obviously increased after HS. Metabolomic analysis of the cecal contents clearly distinguished metabolite changes between the groups. The significantly different metabolites identified were mainly involved in the fatty acid synthesis, purine metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, cyanoamino acid metabolism, glyceride metabolism, and plasmalogen synthesis.
   Conclusion
   In summary, high temperature disrupted the homeostatic balance of the intestinal microbiota in mice and also induced significant alterations in intestinal metabolites. This study provides a basis for treating intestinal disorders caused by elevated temperature in humans and animals and can further formulate nutritional countermeasures to reduce heat stress-induced damage.

AB  - As platforms age, there are increasing challenges to perpetuate their integrity. Currently, process of life extension and repair decision-making model in ageing offshore platforms which was based on DHGF algorithm was established built in order to make reasonable predictions about of life of ageing offshore platforms, and to make accurate repair decisions and to reduce their risks under uncertain and complicated environment. A decision on whether to install new equipment or recondition existing ones could then be taken in terms of optimal life-cycle cost, reliability, project budgets and safe state. There were 18 indicators based on Delphi method for evaluation system. Hierarchical structures were set up by analyzing and adjusting four dimensions - project factors, risk factors, load factors and structure factors which affect the ageing platform service state. Weighted subset was determined by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Then, we can calculate the gray weights using the gray model theory. The next step is that, it applied fuzzy mathematics to determine the grade evaluation of ageing platform. The evaluation criteria of life extension and repair decision-making model in ageing offshore platforms were established. The comprehensive score was calculated by a sequence of computational steps. Furthermore, life extension and repair decision-making reference table was set up and the period of life extension and repair grade in offshore platform was determined in the light of this table. Life extension and repair decisions for two platforms were made by using this new model and the results were compared with the traditional methods. Research results display that this model can describe the dynamic economic lifetime of ageing offshore platforms more accurately and give a new resolution for the research of life extension and repair decision-making under uncertain and complicated environment.

AB  - Background There has been a rising interest within the scientific community and the public about the environmental risk related to the abundance of microplastics in aquatic environments. Up to now, however, scientific knowledge in this context has been scarce and insufficient for a reliable risk assessment. To remedy this scarcity of data, we investigated possible adverse effects of polystyrene particles (10(4) particles/L) and the pesticide methiocarb (1 mg/L) in juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) both by themselves as well as in combination after a 96 h laboratory exposure. PS beads (density 1.05 g/mL) were cryogenically milled and fractionated resulting in irregular-shaped particles (< 50 mu m). Besides body weight of the animals, biomarkers for proteotoxicity (stress protein family Hsp70), oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase, lipid peroxidation), and neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase, carboxylesterases) were analyzed. As an indicator of overall health, histopathological effects were studied in liver and gills of exposed fish. Results Polystyrene particles by themselves did not influence any of the investigated biomarkers. In contrast, the exposure to methiocarb led to a significant reduction of the activity of acetylcholinesterase and the two carboxylesterases. Moreover, the tissue integrity of liver and gills was impaired by the pesticide. Body weight, the oxidative stress and the stress protein levels were not influenced by methiocarb. Effects caused by co-exposure of polystyrene microplastics and methiocarb were the same as those caused by methiocarb alone. Conclusions Overall, methiocarb led to negative effects in juvenile brown trout. In contrast, polystyrene microplastics in the tested concentration did not affect the health of juvenile brown trout and did not modulate the toxicity of methiocarb in this fish species.

AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a North American grass that exhibits vast genetic diversity across its geographic range. In the Northeastern US, local switchgrass populations were restricted to a narrow coastal zone before European settlement, but current populations inhabit inland road verges raising questions about their origin and genetics. These questions are important because switchgrass lines with novel traits are being cultivated as a biofuel feedstock, and gene flow could impact the genetic integrity and distribution of local populations. This study was designed to determine if: 1) switchgrass plants collected in the Long Island Sound Coastal Lowland coastal Level IV ecoregion represented local populations, and 2) switchgrass plants collected from road verges in the adjacent inland regions were most closely related to local coastal populations or switchgrass from other geographic regions. The study used 18microsatellitemarkers to infer the genetic relationships between 122 collected switchgrass plants and a reference dataset consisting of 28 cultivars representing ecotypes, ploidy levels, and lineages from North America. Results showed that 84% of 88 plants collected in the coastal plants were most closely aligned with the Lowland tetraploid genetic pool. Among this group, 61 coastal plants were similar to, but distinct from, all Lowland tetraploid cultivars in the reference dataset leading to the designation of a genetic sub-population called the Southern New England Lowland Tetraploids. In contrast, 67% of 34 plants collected in road verges in the inland ecoregions were most similar to two Upland octoploid cultivars; only 24% of roadside plants were Lowland tetraploid. These results suggest that cryptic, non-local genotypes exist in road verges and that gene flow from biofuels plantations could contribute to further changes in switchgrass population genetics in the Northeast.

AB  - Arsenic, an important hazard in the environment, is associated with human cancer and other degenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying arsenic hazardous effects remain unclear. It has been reported arsenic exposure can result in increased cellular reactive oxygen species and oxidative DNA damage. This suggests DNA base excision repair (BER), the major pathway for repairing oxidative DNA damage, may be involved in combating arsenic hazardous effects. As a critical repair enzyme in BER, DNA polymerase beta (Pol beta) might play an essential role in reducing arsenic toxicity. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated arsenic-induced cytotoxic and genotoxic effects under Pol beta deficiency. Our results demonstrated that the viability of Pol beta-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts was much lower than that of Pol beta wild-type cells after treatment with arsenite (As(3+)). An increased level of DNA damage and significantly delayed arsenite-induced DNA damage repair in Pol beta-deficient cells indicated reduced repair of DNA lesions under Pol beta deficiency. This was consistent with the increase in the frequency of micronuclei (MN), an indicator of chromosomal breakage, which was also observed in Pol beta-deficient cells treated with arsenite. In contrast, cells harboring overexpressed Pol beta resulted in a lower level of DNA damage and MN than Pol beta wild-type cells, indicating overexpression of the enzyme can combat arsenic-induced genotoxic effects. In conclusion, our results indicate an important role for Pol beta in repairing arsenite-induced DNA damage and maintaining chromosomal integrity and further suggest deficiency of BER may be involved in arsenic genotoxicity and carcinogenicity.

AB  - Electrofishing is a valuable tool used to collect fish assemblage data, which is often vital to ecological assessments; however, wadeable electrofishing protocols vary in optimal reach length and number of passes based on study objectives, stream size, and geographic region, among other factors. This study examined a method intended to efficiently assess fish assemblage composition through the use of a single-unit, width-based electrofishing protocol using multiple passes. Fish assemblage data were collected using backpack or tote barge electrofishing equipment from 93 wadeable streams 2.3-76.4 m in width in the Susquehanna River basin (SRB). Results indicated that >97% of total species present were collected after the first two electrofishing passes, regardless of stream size. New species were more often captured on subsequent electrofishing passes in larger streams. Compared with other studies our results suggest less electrofishing effort is necessary to accurately estimate fish assemblage composition in smaller streams and in more depauperate ichthyofaunal regions. A single electrofishing pass satisfied the objective of obtaining >= 90% assemblage similarity in small streams = 5 m wide. Two electrofishing passes were necessary to reach >= 90% assemblage similarity in larger wadeable SRB streams > 5 m in width. Results suggest a single electrofishing unit and a crew of = 4 individuals can obtain reliable estimates of fish assemblage composition from wadeable streams of various sizes, which may be desirable when personnel or gear is limited. The shortcomings of single-unit, multiple-pass electrofishing (e.g., inability to model abundance or species richness) reinforce the need for managers and researchers to choose electrofishing protocols based on study objectives. Overall, our results suggest that the single-unit, multiple-pass protocol performed throughout a reach equal to 10 times the stream width is appropriate to reliably estimate fish assemblage composition in streams of the mid-Atlantic and northeastern regions of the United States.

AB  - We set up a simple, culture independent, low-cost and high-throughput method for DNA-based quantitative assessment of soil microbial biomass using eight soils covering a wide range of physico-chemical properties. DNA was extracted with a 0.12 M, pH 8 Na2HPO4 buffer using bead beating; double stranded DNA (dsDNA) was quantified in a crude (not purified) extract using PicoGreen reagent. In contrast to yields obtained by using a commercial standard method (FastDNA Kit for soil, MP-Biomedicals), our yields of dsDNA were generally higher, most probably because any purification method for obtaining highly pure DNA for downstream analyses leads to DNA loss. These results suggest the new method provides more reliable quantitative data; thus it is a good environmental indicator, as an underestimation of the soil microbial biomass due to DNA loss during purification can be excluded. The ratio between microbial C (Cmic) obtained by the traditional, widely used fumigation-extraction method and dsDNA ranged from 12.0 to 63.5 mu g Cmic per mu g dsDNA. Crude DNA obtained by the new method as well as purified DNA obtained by using the commercial kit were compared in terms of quantity (fluorometry; spectrophotometry) and quality (purity indices: A(260)/A(280),A(260)/A(230); PCR compatibility; gel electrophoresis: molecular weight and molecular integrity). Our results suggest that the new method provides a high-throughput estimator of microbial biomass (expressed as mu gdsDNAg(-1) soil) in soils having widely different properties without the need for high-cost commercial extraction kits and/or cumbersome individual methods. Due to its simplicity, speed and low-cost, our method is capable for routine quantitative assessments of soil microbial biomass, assessable also for soil scientists with laboratories that are otherwise not equipped for molecular analyses.

AB  - The potential prognostic use of lysosomal reactions to environmental pollutants is explored in relation to predicting animal health in marine mussels, based on diagnostic biomarker data. Cellular lysosomes are already known to accumulate many metals and organic xenobiotics and the lysosomal accumulation of the carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) is demonstrated here in the hepatopancreatic digestive cells and ovarian oocytes of the blue mussel. Lysosomal membrane integrity or stability appears to be a generic indicator of cellular well-being in eukaryotes; and in bivalve Molluscs it is Correlated with total oxygen and nitrogen radical scavenging capacity (TOSC), protein synthesis, scope for growth and larval viability; and inversely correlated with DNA damage (micronuclei), as well as lysosomal swelling (volume density), lipidosis and lipofuscinosis, which are all characteristic of failed or incomplete autophagy. Integration of multiple biomarker data is achieved using multivariate statistics and then mapped onto "health status space" by using lysosomal membrane stability as a measure of cellular well-being. This is viewed as a crucial step towards the derivation of explanatory frameworks for prediction of pollutant impact oil animal health; and has facilitated the development of a conceptual mechanistic model linking lysosomal damage and autophagic dysfunction with injury to cells, tissues and the whole animal. This model has also complemented the creation and use of a cell-based bioenergetic computational model Of Molluscan hepatopancreatic cells that Simulates lysosomal and cellular reactions to pollutants. More speculatively, the use of coupled empirical measurements of biomarker reactions and modelling is proposed as a practical approach to the development of an operational toolbox for predicting the health of the environment.

AB  - Agriculture is important to New Zealand's economy. Like other primary producers, New Zealand strives to increase agricultural output while maintaining environmental integrity. Utilising modelling to explore the economic, environmental and land use impacts of policy is critical to understand the likely effects on the sector. Key deficiencies within existing land use and land cover change models are the lack of heterogeneity in farmers and their behaviour, the role that social networks play in information transfer, and the abstraction of the global and regional economic aspects within local-scale approaches. To resolve these issues we developed the Agent-based Rural Land Use New Zealand model. The model utilises a partial equilibrium economic model and an agent-based decision-making framework to explore how the cumulative effects of individual farmer's decisions affect farm conversion and the resulting land use at a catchment scale. The model is intended to assist in the development of policy to shape agricultural land use intensification in New Zealand. We illustrate the model, by modelling the impact of a greenhouse gas price on farm-level land use, net revenue, and environmental indicators such as nutrient losses and soil erosion for key enterprises in the Hurunui and Waiau catchments of North Canterbury in New Zealand. Key results from the model show that farm net revenue is estimated to increase over time regardless of the greenhouse gas price. Net greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to decline over time, even under a no GHG price baseline, due to an expansion of forestry on low productivity land. Higher GHG prices provide a greater net reduction of emissions. While social and geographic network effects have minimal impact on net revenue and environmental outputs for the catchment, they do have an effect on the spatial arrangement of land use and in particular the clustering of enterprises.

AB  - Crustaceans have been designated as internationally important model organisms in the development of environmental radioprotection measures. Despite the known sensitivity of sperm to ionizing radiation, the impacts of chronic radiation exposure on male fertility in crustaceans have not been studied. For the first time, the present study aimed to assess the impacts of chronic radiation exposure on male fertility, sperm DNA damage and concomitant impacts on breeding in two amphipod crustaceans. Echinogammarus marinas and Gammarus pulex (male fertility only) were exposed to phosphorus-32 at dose rates of 0, 0.1, 1 and 10 mGy/d and sperm parameters, DNA damage and knock-on impacts on breeding were assessed. Sperm quality parameters and DNA damage were assessed using a fluorescent staining method and single cell gel electrophoresis respectively. Concomitant effects of male exposure to radiation on fecundity were determined by pairing phosphorus-32 exposed males to unexposed sexually mature females. In E. marinas, a statistically significant reduction of 9 and 11% in the quality of sperm was recorded at dose rates of 1 and 10 mGy/d respectively, with no significant effects recorded on sperm counts. Conversely in the freshwater G. pulex, no significant impact of radiation on sperm quantity or quality was recorded. For E. marinas, a statistically significant increase in DNA damage was recorded at doses of 10 mGy/d. Reduced fecundity and an increase in the frequency of abnormal embryos was recorded in female E. marinas breeding with males exposed to radiation. These findings suggest sperm quality may be a sensitive indicator of radiation exposure in invertebrates with potential impacts on the unexposed embryo, though unclear dose-response and differences between two closely related species necessitate further study before robust conclusions can be drawn.

AB  - The objective of the present article is to propose an index that allows the assessment of the fluvial habitat quality in lowland streams that run through urbanized areas, by the use of metrics related to the quality of the watercourse, the river banks, the riparian zone and the fluvial geomorphology. The metrics retained in the index (USHI, Urban Stream Habitat Index) include the cover percentage and quality of the aquatic vegetation; the main features of the river banks; the presence of exotic trees, of litter, of permanent structures (such as buildings) in the riparian zone and other major geomorphological alterations, such as dredging or channelization. The index is related to physical-chemical parameters that are linked to water quality, the imperviousness of the watershed and to other biotic descriptors, particularly the macroinvertebrate and diatom assemblages. The values of the index for the sites in the studied area revealed that 41.2% have a bad or very bad habitat quality, 27.8% a moderate habitat quality, while 31% have a good or very good habitat quality. The main issue detected in the studied sites involved the dredging or partial channelization of the reaches. Unlike other indices that evaluate the quality of the physical habitat through the use of the diatoms or macroinvertebrate communities, the USHI can be interpreted as a measure of the overall quality of the habitat, and uses indicators that do not require the identification of taxa, making it more accessible to non-specialists. Therefore it provides with a tool to evaluate the fluvial habitat quality of lowland streams that can be easily applied, particularly by professionals that take part in the management and decision making process regarding urbanized watersheds.

AB  - Habitat structure and diversity were investigated at multiple scales along the Tagliamento River (NE Italy) to analyze the spatial and temporal configuration of the aquatic habitat templet in a complex alluvial river corridor in the European Alps. A geomorphic approach was employed to determine floodplain structure and channel configuration using aerial photographs and digitized maps. Structural, thermal, and chemical variables were sampled monthly for one year in 3-km long study sections within six distinct geomorphic reaches along the longitudinal continuum. Aquatic habitat heterogeneity and complexity was quantified along the longitudinal dimension (corridor scale), within geomorphic reaches (floodplain scale) and within floodplain water bodies (within-habitat scale). Four major types of aquatic habitats were distinguished: surface-connected channels (SC), alluvial channels (AC), tributary channels (TC), and isolated standing water bodies (ISO). The first 3 types included primary, secondary, and tertiary branches plus backwaters. Active floodplain width was greatest in the island-braided lower floodplain (reach IV), which also exhibited the highest values for aquatic habitat area per river km, aquatic-terrestrial ecotone length per river km, within-floodplain thermal heterogeneity, and aquatic habitat diversity. Principal component analysis (PCA) clearly distinguished lotic from standing waters along the primary axis and substrate gradients (both longitudinally between floodplains and laterally within floodplains) on the secondary axis. PCA applied to 21 chemical variables illustrated a downstream increase in floodplain-scale spatio-temporal heterogeneity along the river corridor. Total environmental variance is considerably enhanced by the superimposition of longitudinal changes (corridor scale) on lateral changes within geomorphic reaches (floodplain scale). This study clearly demonstrated the high levels of structural complexity and habitat diversity that are possible in Alpine rivers, with implications for the important role of environmental heterogeneity in sustaining functional integrity.

AB  - Background: Solar water disinfection (SODIS) is an appropriate technology for household treatment of drinking water in low-to-middle-income communities, as it is effective, low cost and easy to use. Nevertheless, uptake is low due partially to the burden of using small volume polyethylene terephthalate bottles (1.5-2 L). A major challenge is to develop a low-cost transparent container for disinfecting larger volumes of water. (2) Methods: This study examines the capability of transparent polypropylene (PP) buckets of 5 L- and 20 L- volume as SODIS containers using three waterborne pathogen indicators: Escherichia coli, MS2-phage and Cryptosporidium parvum. (3) Results: Similar inactivation kinetics were observed under natural sunlight for the inactivation of all three organisms in well water using 5 L- and 20 L-buckets compared to 1.5 L-polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) bottles. The PP materials were exposed to natural and accelerated solar ageing (ISO-16474). UV transmission of the 20 L-buckets remained stable and with physical integrity even after the longest ageing periods (9 months or 900 h of natural or artificial solar UV exposure, respectively). The 5 L-buckets were physically degraded and lost significant UV-transmission, due to the thinner wall compared to the 20 L-bucket. (4) Conclusion: This work demonstrates that the 20 L SODIS bucket technology produces excellent bacterial, viral and protozoan inactivation and is obtained using a simple transparent polypropylene bucket fabricated locally at very low cost ($2.90 USD per unit). The increased bucket volume of 20 L allows for a ten-fold increase in treatment batch volume and can thus more easily provide for the drinking water requirements of most households. The use of buckets in households across low to middle income countries is an already accepted practice.

AB  - The compound 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is the first choice chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), but intestinal mucositis is a primary limiting factor in anticancer therapy. There is currently no broadly effective targeted treatment to cure this side effect. Carboxymethylated pachyman (CMP) is a polysaccharide that is modified from the structure of pachyman isolated from Poria cocos (Chinese name: Fu Ling). Meanwhile, recent studies have shown that CMP exhibits immune regulatory, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the intestinal protective effect of CMP in 5-FU-treated CT26 tumour-bearing mice and to further explore its underlying mechanism(s) of action. Initially, a CT26 colon carcinoma xenograft mice model was established. The colon length, colon tissue injury, intestinal flora, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and indicators linked to inflammation, antioxidation and apoptosis were then measured. Our results showed that CMP in combination with 5-FU reversed intestinal shortening (p < 0.01) and alleviated 5-FU-induced colon injury (p < 0.001) via suppression of ROS production; increasing the levels of CAT, GSH-Px and GSH; decreasing expression of NF-.B, p-p38 and Bax; and elevating the levels of Nrf2 and Bcl-2. More importantly, CMP had a significant impact and counteracted the intestinal microflora disorders produced by 5-FU by increasing the proportion of Bacteroidetes, lactobacilli, and butyric acid-producing and acetic acid-producing bacteria and restoring the intestinal flora diversity. Overall, this work suggested that CMP could regulate the ecological balance of the intestinal flora and reduce colon injuries induced by 5-FU in CT26 tumour-bearing mice, and the mechanism involved may be associated with the regulation of the NF-.B, Nrf2-ARE and MAPK/ P38 pathways.

AB  - Purpose Halal supply chain management (HSCM) is an emerging research area and is in the early stage of evolution. This study aims to identify 11 critical factors towards effective management of a Halal supply chain (HSC) and provides a framework for the HSCM by evaluating Halal practices' impact on sustainability performance measures empirically. Design/methodology/approach A structured questionnaire-based survey has been carried out to collect data for analysis. The statistical analysis is accomplished by exploiting merits of factor analysis and structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings The results imply that out of 11 critical factors, nine factors on effective management of the HSC are statistically significant, and impacts of two critical factors are positive but statistically insignificant. In the structural model, the path coefficient of all success indicators are positive and statistically significant. In terms of the path coefficient of sustainable performance measures of HSC, all three dimensions, economic, environmental and social, are positive and statistically significant. Research limitations/implications The research extends Halal and supply chain management's literature by proposing Halal as a standard quality control system, as it focuses on wholesome consumption. Effective management of the HSC is positively related to the firms' sustainable performance, thus helping managers make the organisation sustainable in the long term. Practical implications The research extends the literature of Halal and supply chain management by proposing Halal as a standard quality control system, which focuses on wholesome consumption. Effective management of the HSC is positively related to the sustainable performance of the firms, thus helps managers in making the organisation sustainable in the long term. Originality/value The result of the study underlines that sustainable performance measures are embedded in HSCM. This research develops a new paradigm in the research of HSCM and sustainability.

AB  - The assessment of community well-being is critical as an end-point measure that will facilitate decision support and assist in the identification of sustainable solutions to address persistent problems. While the overall measure is important, it is equally vital to distinguish variations among groups within the population who may be impacted in a different manner. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) developed the Human Well-Being Index (HWBI), as a way of measuring these outcomes and assessing community characteristics. The HWBI approach produces a suite of indicators, domains and a final composite index appropriate for characterizing well-being of a population. While generalized approaches are needed, it is important to also recognize variations in well-being across community enclaves. This paper presents an adaption of the HWBI for child populations to test the applicability of the index framework to specific community enclaves. First, an extensive literature review was completed to ensure the theoretical integrity of metric and indicator substitutions from the original HWBI framework. Metric data were then collected, refined, imputed where necessary and evaluated to confirm temporal and spatial availability. A Children's Well-Being Index (CWBI) value, representing the same indicators and domains of well-being as the original HWBI, was calculated for the population under age 18 across all US counties for 2011. Implications of this research point to an effective, holistic end-point measure that can be tracked over time. Similarly, there is great potential for the application of the original HWBI method to other statistical population segments within the greater US population. These adaptations could help identify and close gaps in equity of resource distribution among these groups.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is cumulative poison which can damage the kidneys after prolonged exposure in the industry or the environment. Renal damage induced by Cd affects primarily the cellular and functional integrity of the proximal tubules, the main site of the renal accumulation of the metal. This results in a variety of urinary abnormalities including an increased excretion of calcium, amino acids, enzymes and proteins. These effects have been documented by a large number of studies conducted during more than two decades in experimental animals and in populations environmentally or occupationally exposed to Cd. There is now a general agreement to say that the most sensitive and specific indicator of Cd-induced renal dysfunction is a decreased tubular reabsorption of low molecular weight proteins, leading to the so-called tubular proteinuria. beta(2)-microblobulin, retinol-binding protein and alpha(1)-microglobulin are the microproteins the most commonly used for screening renal damage in populations at risk. Tubular dysfunction develops in a dose-dependent manner according to the internal dose of Cd as assessed on the basis of Cd levels in kidney, urine or in blood. Depending on the sensitivity of the renal biomarker and the susceptibility of the exposed populations, the thresholds of urinary Cd vary from 2 to 10 mug/g creatinine. The thresholds associated with the development of the microproteinuria, the critical effect predictive of a decline of the renal function, is estimated around 10 mug/g creatinine for both occupationally and environmentally exposed populations. Much lower thresholds have been reported in some European studies conducted on the general population. These low thresholds, however, have been derived from associations whose causality remains uncertain and for urinary protein increases that might be reversible. Cd-induced microproteinuria is usually considered as irreversible except at the incipient stage of the intoxication where a partial or complete reversibility has been found in some studies.

AB  - For reasons of aspired naturalness and cost reduction, vitamin additions should be kept low in organic livestock systems. To define safe lower threshold levels of riboflavin supplementation in organic poultry feeding, 135 hybrid layers were allocated to three dietary treatments supplemented with either 4.5 (R4.5), 3.0 (R3.0) or 1.5 mg (R1.5) GMO-free riboflavin added per kg feed. This resulted in total measured concentration averages of 5.0, 4.5, and 3.1 mg kg(-1) feed for R4.5, R3.0 and R1.5, respectively. For 18 weeks, each treatment was replicated in three groups of 15 hens. Feed consumption, laying performance, egg quality, riboflavin concentration in the yolk, and clinical health scores were assessed. Two hens per group (six per treatment) were slaughtered in weeks 11 and 18, respectively, for measurement of pancreas, spleen, liver and heart weights, and determination of liver riboflavin. No treatment effects on feed consumption, body weight, laying performance, egg weights, eggshell strength and yolk colour or plumage and keel bone integrity were observed. No symptoms of lameness or footpad damage were found. The riboflavin concentration in egg yolks in R1.5 was lower than in other treatments. Liver riboflavin concentration increased between week 11 and 18 in all treatments, but it was also lower in R1.5. Based on these results, the addition of 3 mg riboflavin kg(-1) feed appeared to be sufficient with respect to the health and performance of laying hens. Supplementation with only 1.5 mg kg(-1) resulted in some metabolic signs of deficiency. These results apply only to organic winter diets.

AB  - One of the key factors affecting the integrity of forest ecosystems in portions of the eastern United States is heavy browsing by overabundant populations of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman). Deer impacts to upland forests of the Allegheny Plateau in northwestern PA, USA, have been especially intense: high levels of deer browsing over the past 60 years have strongly influenced forest pattern and process. Riparian forests of the region are rich in herbaceous plant species, but virtually nothing is known about how deer browsing may influence the structure and function of these systems. Moreover, reliable techniques for assessing and monitoring deer impacts on riparian forests are lacking. The goal of this study was to determine whether the common riparian herbaceous plant turtlehead, Chelone glabra L., is a useful indicator species with which to assess and monitor the intensity of deer browsing in the herbaceous layer of Allegheny Plateau riparian forests. The percentage of C. glabra stems browsed by deer was significantly correlated with intensity of browsing on the herbaceous community during one sample period, but stem height, an attribute used widely in other studies of browse indicator species, was poorly correlated with intensity of browsing. Three other herbaceous plant species, Aster divaricatus L., A. prenanthoides Muhl. and Impatiens capensis Meerb., were preferentially browsed by deer and show promise for use as indicators of browsing intensity in riparian forests. Variability in deer browsing intensity on C. glabra across sites and sample periods suggests that use of an assemblage of herbaceous browse indicator species is preferable to sole reliance on C. glabra for assessing and monitoring browsing impact.

AB  - Sustainability assessment is a complex field and its uptake amongst agricultural producers limited. Furthermore, the scope of current sustainability assessment tools does not extend to systems in which food production is integrated with production of non-food biomass (e.g. agroforestry). Participatory approaches to tool development offer a means to overcome the subjectivity of researcher-led tool design and thus the potential to increase relevance and engagement. In this work we develop a Delphi-style methodology as a means to produce a sustainability assessment tool suitable to assess and feedback on an integrated food/non-food system. Using a widely accepted agricultural sustainability framework and an existing farm sustainability assessment tool as a base, stakeholders were engaged with across six countries and multiple stakeholder groups to identify key indicators to be added to the tool. The methodology developed is described in detail, framed in the setting of this tool development process but providing a novel framework applicable to any situation where indicators must be developed for a complex issue of interest across multiple perspectives and stakeholder groups. Feedback and learning from the experience is provided. It was found that, contrary to some opinion, the inclusion of a face-to-face discussion round as part of the Delphi procedure provides a valuable means for information exchange and a move towards consensus amongst stakeholders. By using a 'snowball' approach to the in person discussions, it appears too that the loss of the voices of more socially retiring individuals can be avoided. Final levels of agreement vary substantially across the different areas of sustainability, with indicators in some areas (e.g. environmental integrity) proving much less controversial than others (e.g. social wellbeing). Despite this, the methodology effectively reaches a level of consensus amongst diverse stakeholders sufficient to guide the selection of sustainability indicators with a good level of confidence.

AB  - The aim of the article is to study Russian and foreign (world) experience of interacting educational organizations with public authorities and prospects for improving Russian practice on the basis of the GR-management mechanism. With the help of methods of horizontal and trend analysis, the authors evaluate the development of the educational system by comparing the increment of results (values of the knowledge economy index and the education index) with the growth of the expenditure indicators (the absolute and relative expenditures of the consolidated budget of the Russian Federation in the "Education" section). The authors also apply the correlation analysis method to identify the relationship between the outcome indicators and the cost indicators. The timeframe of the study covers 2010-16. The information base of the research includes the materials of the official statistical reporting of the World Bank, the Federal State Statistics Service of the Russian Federation (Rosstat), and the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation. As a result of the study, the authors substantiate the thesis that GR-management really represents a modern and promising mechanism for increasing the effectiveness of interaction between educational organizations and public authorities. In contemporary Russia, the interaction of educational organizations with public authorities is carried out on the basis of the mechanisms of state standardization, state licensing, and state order, which implies the unilateral nature of this interaction and its low efficiency. In order to improve the effectiveness of interaction between educational organizations and public authorities in contemporary Russia, the paper recommends to rely on successful global experience in the use of the GR-management mechanism, which ensures the bilateral nature of communication, integrity and systemic relations between educational organizations and public authorities. To achieve this, the authors' conceptual model of GR-management of an educational organization in contemporary Russia is offered.

AB  - Coastal sandy ecosystems are increasingly being threatened by human pressure, causing loss of biodiversity, habitat degradation and landscape modifications. However, there are still very few detailed studies focussing on compositional changes in coastal dune plant communities over time. In this work, we investigated how coastal dune European Union (EU) habitats (from pioneer annual beach communities to Mediterranean scrubs on the landward fixed dunes) have changed during the last 20 years. Using phytosociological releves conducted in 1989-90 and in 2010-12, we investigated changes in floristic composition over time. We then compared plant cover and the proportion of ruderal, alien and habitat diagnostic species ('focal species') in the two periods. Finally, we used Ellenberg indicator values to define the 'preferences' of the plant species for temperature and moisture. We found that only fore dune habitats showed significant differences in species cover between the two time periods, with higher plant cover in the more recent releves and a significant increase in thermophilic species. Although previous studies have demonstrated consistent habitat loss in this area, we observed that all coastal dune plant communities remain well represented, after a 20-year period. However, fore dunes have been experiencing significant compositional changes. Although we cannot confirm whether the observed changes are strictly related to climatic changes, to human pressure or to both, we hypothesize that a moderate increment in average yearly temperature may have promoted the increase in plant cover and the spread of thermophilic species. Thus, even though human activities are major driving forces of change in coastal dune vegetation, at the community scale climatic factors may also play important roles. Our study draws on re-visitation studies which appear to constitute a powerful tool for the assessment of the conservation status of EU habitats.

AB  - An appropriate medication management depends on executive system integrity, which can be affected by aging. Previous studies showed that seniors commit frequent errors when having to fill in a pillbox. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no study has really considered the absence of cognitive disorders in the studied sample. The present study aimed to investigate pillbox filling in cognitively healthy elderly (specially focusing on executive system preservation) for whom no cognitive deterioration neither any depressive episode had occurred during a one year period. The filling task has been completed using a weekly pillbox and eight fictitious drugs. The selection of the 27 seniors aged from 71 to 90 years has been based on their results to neuropsychological tests (Trail making test, Stroop Victoria, Tower of London, Montreal cognitive assessment) and a depression assessment scale (Short geriatric depression scale). Results showed that 67% of the participants committed at least one error when filling the pillbox and 56% at least 3. The maximal number of errors was 38. Further, the errors analysis showed that 85% of the errors had been repeated (e.g. reproduced on several days). Finally, the more complex the drug prescriptions are, the higher the error rate is. No other variable (age, gender, level education, habit of filling a pillbox) had any effect on the number of errors. So, the pillbox filing task can be considered as a complex task associated with a high risk of errors. Moreover, the absence of cognitive disorders is not a success factor to the task. A prospect for the future should be to try to limit the error rate by developing, for instance, an external support helping to the filling of the pillbox and a learning process for the use of this support.

AB  - This research uses the concept of propagule pressure (number of individuals introduced and number of introduction attempts) to investigate human-mediated bioinvasion patterns. We quantified diatoms in the sediments of ballast tanks of commercial ships arriving on both Canadian coasts during 2007 to 2009. Diatom cell concentrations varied from non-detected to 10(5) cells g(-1) wet weight (10(11) cells per tank). Although the lowest values were often found in tanks that underwent ballast water exchange, the highest concentrations (10(9) to 10(11) cells per tank) were detected in all voyage categories: transoceanic with ballast exchange (TOE), and intra-coastal with exchange (ICE) and without exchange (ICU). For the west coast, 36% of tanks carried detectable quantities of diatoms and there was no statistical difference between ship categories. For the east coast, 60% of tanks contained diatoms; ICU represented a bioinvasion pattern based on more frequent events with consistently lower cell concentrations, whereas ICE and TOE corresponded to less frequent events, though more variable in cell concentrations. Diversity reached 40 taxa per tank, including resting stages and cells that were supposedly growing vegetatively. New records may lead to introduction hypotheses that ought not to be accepted uncritically. Cell viability was tested using the vital stain fluorescein diacetate; parallel counts of protoplasm integrity and chlorophyll autofluorescence revealed that all 3 indicators gave results within the same order of magnitude. Inoculation of 0.2 to 0.5 ml of the slurry into culture media led to the growth of diatoms, even of taxa not initially detected. Within 7 d, cultured assemblages reached cell concentrations equivalent to 1.8 to 4.4 doublings of the original inoculation.

AB  - Simple Summary Scientists are constantly making efforts to determine the fertilization capacity of sperm after ejaculation. The present research proves that the application of Holothuroidea extract to the semen extender improves its cryostability, and has a positive effect on the biological quality of sperm after the freezing process. Moreover, it has been proven that the proAKAP4 biomarker can be successfully used to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of various extenders for semen cryopreservation. The aim of this study was to determine the concentration of proAKAP4 and other indicators of cryopotential of spermatozoa cryopreserved in extender with Holothuroidea extract addition. Nine Holstein Friesian bulls, 3.5 years old, of known health status, were used for the study. The animals were kept and fed equally. Semen was collected once a week using an artificial vagina. The commercially available Holothuroidea extract was used as a supplement to the commercial extender (0, 2, 4 and 6 mu L/mL) before the freezing/thawing process. The viability, motility, motion parameters, and acrosome integrity of the sperm were analyzed with (test) or without (control) extract samples. Furthermore, the concentration of the proAKAP4 biomarker in frozen sperm was assessed. It was shown that the addition of 4 and 6 mu L of the extract may have a positive effect on the quality parameters of the sperm after thawing. The results indicate that extender supplementation with the above extract modulates (increases) the concentration of proAKAP4 in sperm at all tested levels. Additionally, this indicator has become helpful in identifying sperm of poor biological quality. Moreover, it has been proven that the proAKAP4 biomarker can be successfully used to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of various extenders for semen cryopreservation.

AB  - The current study designed to obtain, execute and test a freeze-drying protocol for the preparation and a better storage conservation of the live attenuate Mycobacterium bovis BCG-Moreau-Finlay, fundamental element for the immunotherapy against bladder carcinoma, passed successfully all trials. The new lyophilized formulation also reduces the in vivo toxicity compared to present BCG liquid preparation by means of lowering dose needed for the treatment. The second re-seeding of the Moreau Rio de Janeiro sub-strain of Mycobacterium bovis BCG (pBCG Moreau); was sub-cultured in the Sauton Synthetic Medium (SSMII), previously maintained in Seed Lot Systems and harvested during the logarithmic growth phase. Basic Bacterial Suspension (BBS) was then prepared, homogenized and stabilized by freeze-drying in vehicle A, compare to vehicle B. By means of Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) was realized the comparative quality control of the (BBS) preparation before and after lyophilisation procedure of the final product. A high (%) colony count measure in Ogawa medium and average survival of 50.4% (Heat stability over the time). Additional values as (0.75 - 0.95 %) were obtained for the ranks of dispersion using Zieln Nielsen and the Dubos Methods. The integrity/vitality oscillated from 67.8 to 68.5 (%) measured by oxygen consumption, the residual humidity indicators from 73 to 74 (%)[BBS] and the accepts organoleptic properties designed all aftermaths concern the in vitro assays required by World Health Organization (WHO) standards for BCG intra-Vesical final product. A freeze-dried "Onco BCG Moreau - Finlay" formulation was successfully produced and has many "in vitro and in vivo test" practical and theoretical advantages when it compared to the current liquid preparation, such as the best preserving BCG biological properties and reducing the dose of product required for treatment.

AB  - Across the globe, wildlife populations and their behaviours are negatively impacted by people. Protected areas are believed to be an antidote to increasing human pressures but even they are not immune to the impact of anthropogenic activities. Areas that have been set aside for the protection of wildlife therefore warrant more attention when investigating the impact of anthropogenic pressures on wildlife. We use cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus as a case study to explore how a large carnivore responds to anthropogenic pressures inside wildlife areas. Using GPS-collar data we investigate cheetah space use, both when moving and stationary, and movement parameters (speed and turn angles) in relation to human disturbance, distance to human settlement, livestock abundance and livestock site use inside wildlife areas. Space use was negatively influenced by human disturbance, resulting in habitat loss and fragmentation and potentially reducing landscape permeability between neighbouring wildlife areas. Cheetahs were also less likely to stop in areas where livestock numbers were high, but more likely to stop in areas that were frequently used by livestock. The latter could reflect that cheetahs are attracted to livestock however, cheetahs in the study area rarely predated on livestock. It is therefore more likely that areas that are frequently used by livestock attract wild herbivores, which in turn could influence cheetah space use. We did not find any effects of people and livestock on cheetahs' speed and turn angles which might be related to the resolution of the data. We found that cheetahs are sensitive to human pressures and we believe that they could be an indicator species for other large carnivores facing similar challenges. We suggest that further research is needed to determine the levels of anthropogenic pressures needed to maintain ecological integrity, especially inside wildlife areas.

AB  - Cell integrity is affected by oxidative stress when the production of active oxidants overwhelms antioxidant defense mechanisms. Latex, a natural polymer obtained from Hevea brasiliensis, is used in medical industry for manufacturing surgical gloves, urinary catheters, and dental dams. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of latex material on oxidative stress by in vivo and in vitro methods. In addition, the material was screened for its ability to induce any chromosomal aberrations (CAs) by in vitro method. In vivo studies were carried out with implanted latex material onto subcutaneous tissue of various batches of experimental Wistar rats. At the end of experimental period, animals were anesthetized, blood was collected for serum analysis, and sacrificed. Liver was excised for the determination of antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation (LPO). Subcutaneous tissues were obtained for the extraction of genomic DNA from implanted animals and checked for the presence of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), considered an indicator of DNA damage. Simultaneously, in vitro studies were carried out using fresh liver and subcutaneous tissue obtained from Swiss albino mice treated with physiological saline extract of latex material. For the estimation of both in vitro and in vivo oxidative stress, 10% liver homogenate was assessed for stress indicators like reduced glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, LPO and protein content. The results of both in vivo and in vitro studies indicated that the chemical leachents from the latex material did not significantly affect LPO and the levels of antioxidant enzymes. There was also no significant increase in 8-OHdG content due to the presence of implanted latex material. Finally, the results of in vitro CA test and G banding indicated that extracts of test material did not induce any chromosomal abnormalities.

AB  - A rapid toxicity test based on inhibition of esterase activity in marine and freshwater microalgae (Selenastrum capricornutum, Chlorella sp., Dunaliella tertiolecta, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Tetraselmis sp., Entomoneis cf punctulata, Nitzschia cf paleacea) was developed using flow cytometry, Uptake of fluorescein diacetate (FDA) was optimized for each species by varying the substrate concentration, incubation time, and media pH. Propidium iodide (PI) was utilized to assess membrane integrity. The optimized FDA/PI staining procedure was then used to assess the toxicity of copper in short-term exposures (1-24 h). Esterase activity was a sensitive indicator of copper toxicity in S. capricornutum and E, cf. punctulata. As copper concentrations increased, esterase activity decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. The 3-and 24-h EC(50) values (based on mean activity states) were 112 mug Cu L(-1) (95% confidence limits 88-143) and 51 mug Cu L(-1) (95% confidence limits 38-70) for S, capricornutum and 47 mug Cu L(-1) (95% confidence limits 43-51) and 9.1 mug Cu L(-1) (95% confidence limits 7.6-11) for E, cf. punctulata, respectively. This enzyme inhibition endpoint showed similar sensitivity to chronic growth rate inhibition in E. cf. punctulata (48-h and 72-h EC(50) values of 17 and 18 mug L(-1), respectively) but was less sensitive compared to growth for S. capricornutum (48-h and 72-h EC(50) values of 4.9 and 7.5 mug L(-1), respectively). For the other five species tested, inhibition of FDA fluorescence was relatively insensitive to copper, even at copper concentrations that severely inhibited cell division rate. These short-term bioassays that detect sublethal endpoints may provide a more rapid and cost-effective way of monitoring contaminant impacts in natural waters.

AB  - The risk of groundwater contamination by microbial pathogens is linked to their survival in the subsurface. Although there is a large body of literature on the inactivation behavior of suspended (planktonic) microorganisms, little is known about the inactivation of bacteria when attached to sand grain surfaces in groundwater aquifers. The main goal of this study was to develop a fluorescence-based experimental technique for evaluating the extent of inactivation over time of bacteria adhered onto a surface in an aqueous environment. Key features of the developed technique are as follows: (i) attached cells do not need to be removed from the surface of interest for quantification, (ii) bacterial inactivation can be examined in real-time for prolonged time periods, and (iii) the system remains undisturbed (i.e., the aqueous environment is unchanged) during the assay. A negatively or positively charged substrate (i.e., bare or coated glass slide) was mounted in a parallel-plate flow cell, bacteria were allowed to attach onto the substrate, and the loss of bacterial membrane integrity and respiratory activity were investigated as a function of time by fluorescence microscopy using Live/Dead BacLight and BacLight RedoxSensor CTC (5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride) viability assays. These two different measures of bacterial inactivation result in comparable trends in bacterial inactivation, confirming the validity of the experimental technique. The results of this work show that the developed technique is sensitive enough to distinguish between the inactivation kinetics of different representative bacteria attached to either a negatively charged (bare glass) surface or a positively charged (coated glass) surface. Hence, the technique can be used to characterize bacterial inactivation kinetics when attached to environmentally relevant surfaces over a broad range of groundwater chemistries.

AB  - Recent biogeographical studies have shown positive correlations between plant/vertebrate species richness and human population presence. The same pattern has been reported for Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Plecoptera (stoneflies) and Trichoptera (caddisflies) (EPT) amongst European countries. This is surprising as EPT are bio-indicators of stream pollution and most local studies report higher species richness of these macro-invertebrates where human influences on water quality are lower. Using a newly collated taxonomic dataset, we studied whether the species richness of EPT is related to human population size at finer resolutions (Italy's regions, provinces and 10 x 10 km(2) UTM cells) controlling for sampling effort, variations in area and for spatial autocorrelation. At all study grains, observed EPT species richness was strongly correlated to the number of records available for the same taxon. At the regional level, the observed number of Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera species significantly increased with increasing human population size. At the provincial level, observed species richness decreased significantly with increasing human population size for Ephemeroptera and did not vary significantly for Plecoptera and Trichoptera. At the finest grain scale, there were significant negative correlations of observed Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera species richness with human population size, although the proportion of variance explained was very low. These results were broadly confirmed when analyzing the estimated number of species using the formula of Chao2. Our analysis confirms the scale-dependence of the human population-biodiversity correlation. Over broad scales more populated regions tend to have more species than less populated ones. Restricting the study grain, the positive EPT species people relationship disappears and turns into a negative one. Our findings suggest a challenge also for the conservation of regional EPT diversity. (C) 2010 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dissimilar welds impose a challenge to the engineers concerned with the structural integrity assessment of these joints. This is because of the highly inhomogeneous nature of these joints in terms of their microstructure, mechanical, thermal, and fracture properties. Fracture mechanics-based concepts cannot be directly used because of the problems associated with the definition of a suitable crack-tip loading parameter such as J-integral crack tip opening displacement (CTOD), etc. Again, depending upon the location of initial crack (i.e. base, weld, buttering, different interfaces, etc.), further crack propagation can occur in any material. The objective of the current work is to use micro-mechanical models of ductile fracture for initiation and propagation of cracks in the bimetallic welds. The authors have developed a finite element formulation that incorporates the porous plasticity yield function due to Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman and utilized it here for the analysis. Experiments have been conducted at MPA Stuttgart using single edge-notched bend (SEB) specimens with cracks at different locations of the joint. The micro-mechanical (Gurson) parameters of four different materials (i.e. ferrite, austenite, buttering, and weld) have been determined individually by simulation of fracture resistance behaviour of SEB specimens and comparing the simulated results with those of the experiment. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the damage model in predicting the crack growth in the actual bimetallic-welded specimen, simulation of two SEB specimens (with initial crack at ferrite-buttering and buttering-weld interface) has been carried out. The simulated fracture resistance behaviour compares well with those of the experiment.

AB  - Rodents were sampled using the capture-mark-recapture technique along transects in disturbed and undisturbed tropical forest in Cat Tien National Park in south Vietnam. The transects comprised two strata: traps were placed on the ground and in the canopy 2-12 m above the ground. At the main transect, which was 1500 m long and located in undisturbed forest, a total of 438 rodents (173 squirrels and 265 murids) of 12 different species (one Scuridae sp.; 11 Muridae spp.) were marked between January 2005 and January 2006. At this study site and at another undisturbed tropical forest site in the same area, two species dominated: the rat Maxomys surifer (Miller, 1900) and the squirrel Callosciurus flavimanus (Geoffroy, 1831). During the study period we observed no significant difference between the average abundances of the two species (4.67 +/- 0.86 and 3.1 +/- 0.85 individuals per 100 trap nights, respectively) or between the average proportions of resident squirrels and rats (60.0 +/- 24.1 and 62.5 +/- 11.5, respectively). The number of squirrels that were permanent residents (i.e. dwelling in the same habitat for 1 year) was eightfold the number of rats that were permanent residents. In addition, there was some synchrony in the daily capture dynamics of squirrels and of rats. We observed no significant difference in the total abundance of small mammals between the arboreal and ground strata. At two disturbed tropical forest sites in the same area, however, no such balance between squirrels and rats was observed, and the density of C. flavimanus was very low. We suggest that the relationship between these two dominant species can act as an indicator of the integrity of tropical forest ecosystems in south Vietnam.

AB  - Background, Aims and Scope. Over the last few years there has been extensive research for new indicators providing information about deposition resulting from road traffic and tunnel experiments received special attention in emission research. Mosses have been used for the estimation of atmospheric heavy metal and PAH depositions for more than three decades, although they were used only a few times for estimating ambient air pollution caused by traffic. In the current study, the suitability of using a moss species for monitoring road traffic emissions inside a tunnel was evaluated. This was a first-time ever attempt to use plants (mosses) as bioindicators in a tunnel experiment. Specifically, two relevant questions were examined: 1) Do mosses accumulate toxic substances derived from road traffic emissions under the extremely adverse conditions which can be found in a tunnel, and 2) Which substances can mainly be attributed to road traffic emissions and therefore be taken as efficient and reliable indicators for motor vehicles?
   Methods. For the first time a biomonitor (the moss species Hylocomium splendens (Hedwig) B.S.G.) was used in a road tunnel experiment to analyse emissions from road traffic. Moss samples were exposed for four weeks in wooden frames (size 10 cm x 10 cm), covered by a thin plastic net with a mesh size of 1 cm x 1 cm. 17 elements, mainly heavy metals, and the 16 EPA-PAHs together with coronene were analysed by ICP-AES, AAS and GC-MSD.
   Results. Enrichment factors, calculated by comparing post-experiment concentrations to those of a background site, were high for most PAHs, especially benzo(g,h,i)perylene (150.7), coronene (134.7), benzo(a)anthracene (125.0), indeno(1,2,3c,d)pyrene (79.8), chrysene (78.1), pyrene (69.6) and benzo(b)fluoranthene (67.4), and among the other elements for Sb (73.1), Mo (59.6), Cr (33.9), As (24.1), Cu (19.6), and Zn (17.1). All these substances can thus be taken as indicators for road traffic pollution. Concentrations were also significantly higher in the tunnel mosses for all investigated substances than along busy roads outside tunnels. Cluster analysis revealed groups of substances which could sensibly be attributed to various sources (abrasion processes, Diesel combustion) and enrichment in the various particle size classes.
   Discussion. The extreme high concentrations in the analysed moss samples from inside the tunnel were due to higher concentrations in the ambient tunnel air, and the fact that already deposited chemical substances are not lost by rain, as well as efficient uptake capacities even under the extremely adverse conditions in a tunnel. In accordance with previous studies our results suggest that PAHs are better indicators for emissions from the burning process than heavy metals.
   Conclusions. As in open fields, mosses are suitable indicators for monitoring traffic emissions in tunnels. In addition to biomonitoring in open fields, in tunnel experiments mosses are even better indicators, because the confounding effects of other sources of pollution and the 'noise' in the accumulation process (e.g. washout through wet deposition) are minimised. The results of our study demonstrate the usefulness of mosses for surveying heavy metals and PAH emissions and deposition arising from road traffic sources, even under the extremely adverse conditions of the tunnel environment.
   Recommendation. It can be considered that biomonitors like mosses are a suitable alternative to technical particle filters inside tunnels. They are easy to handle, low in costs and valuable information regarding traffic emissions can be obtained.
   Perspective. The results of this pilot-study proved the feasibility of the method, however, should be corroborated by further investigations based on a sample set that allows for generalization of the findings and might even include other moss species. A comparison of technical measurements with the biomonitoring method could lead to a more general acceptance of the results.

AB  - Modem business conditions are based on the laws and characteristics of the development of market relations. Successful and stable activity of any business entity today directly depends on the effectiveness of the management system, the most important element of which is properly organized control. In the activities of any business entity, the place, role and importance of control are as important as accounting, management and analysis. The domestic science of control has rather deep roots, and the multifaceted nature and depth of the concept of "control" are closely related to the concepts of "management" and "management accounting". In conditions of increasing competition, when the problems of increasing the effectiveness of control are significantly updated, the issues of organizing internal control, its development and integration are becoming more relevant. The study of the category of "internal control", its subjects and objects, the place in the management process allows us to identify in its structure individual species characterized by a targeted orientation and methodological features. The practical implementation of the internal control system should be carried out in accordance with the basic principles of its effective organization, which are closely interconnected, and the procedure for combining them to a greater extent depends on the prevailing specific business conditions and circumstances. Integration of the internal control system into the general management system will ensure the reliability of information at various levels, as well as significantly reduce the potential for making erroneous management decisions. The principles of making a choice when implementing a rational and economically reasonable accounting policy of an autonomous institution depend directly on the valid regulations of the accounting standards of the public sector system of the economy. This aspect makes it possible to influence not only the effectiveness of the use of material, labor and financial resources, but also to ensure a proper level of capital units' turnover, to obtain additional internal sources of capital investments financing and current assets, to attract external resources to expand the scope of an autonomous institution. The application of various models of internal control, including elements of a risk-oriented approach allows to carry out to the right degree conceptual process of organizing enterprise control. The model of the internal control system of an autonomous institution suggested by the authors takes into account a systematic approach, risk orientation considering factors of the internal and external environment, incorporating the model in business processes, with regard to the ultimate goal of implementation increasing the efficiency of business processes while reducing expenses and increasing profit in the financial responsibility centers.
   Indicative management model is widely used as the foundation of management. As a rule, it is based on a spatial vision of internal control, and as an analysis, depending on the activity type of an economic entity, the business processing is allocated, taking into account the influence of various indicators that reflect the factors influence of the external and internal environment, in particular, in the context of parameters of competitive advantage.
   We consider the use of an effective model to be the most promising model of internal control. Based on the author's idea of an integrated model of internal control, its main components will be: a systematic approach, a focus on risks, taking into account factors of the internal and external environment, incorporating the model in business processes and financial responsibility centers. Furthermore the main object of the suggested model of internal control will be risks arising as a result of the influence of factors of the internal and external environment. The purpose of the suggested model is to increase the efficiency of business processes existing in the economic entity while simultaneously reducing expenses and increasing profits in financial responsibility centers.
   Considering that the element "control environment" of internal control within the framework of the current legislation has changed to the institutional internal environment, it is noteworthy that the introduction into application practice of institutional environment of an autonomous institution internal control consists of the following levels: external and internal. The external environment in the form of formal and informal institutes is prevailing, having an impact on the internal environment of an economic entity, represented by its own specific cultural and functional "micro institutes" (formal and informal).

AB  - The authors propose an effective and simple method for the collection and concentration of enteroviruses from environmental water bodies, which is based on adsorption properties of macroporous glass (MPG). MPG enveloped in water-permeable coating permits concentration directly in the water. Poliomyelitis viruses were 100-1000-fold concentrated in laboratory trials. The advantages of the new method in comparison with the routine gauze tampon method were demonstrated in experiments with the indicator virus carried out at sewage works and under field conditions.

AB  - Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a serious complication of pro-inflammatory conditions, such as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. MAS results from over-stimulated immune-related cytokines. Now considered a form of acquired haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, MAS is fatal in up to 20% of children. Fast diagnosis and immediate treatment with broad immunosuppressants and biological drugs targeting inflammatory cytokines are required. High ferritin levels and a high ferritin to erythrocyte sedimentation rate ratio are quick indicators of potential MAS.

AB  - Mixed montane forests cover large tracts of the low mountain ranges that dominate Central Europe and also contain much of the area that is important to forest related nature conservation. However, beyond general patterns little is known about ecologically effective driving factors in this habitat. This results in a lack of precise values that can be used to formulate guidelines for nature conservation oriented management strategies. To improve this situation, we used birds as indicators for forest habitat qualities.
   The avifauna of the Bavarian Forest National Park was investigated on 293 plots of 1 ha along four transects ranging from 655 to 1420 m a.s.l. The investigated forest includes a wide structural gradient ranging from very open, grass dominated areas of the high montane zone, where mature spruce trees have died after bark beetle infestation, to mature mixed montane forests at lower elevations. Altitude is the main factor driving composition of bird assemblages in the montane forests. We analysed occurrence of species using a subdivided dataset, in which the altitude could be eliminated as an important influencing factor, by implementation of General Linear Models under consideration of spatial effects and utilising maximally selected rank statistics. Our analysis identified canopy cover as the most influential factor in montane and high montane forests. Forest age is the second most important gradient in montane forests. The tree species composition has an influence on a limited number of species. In high montane forests, bark beetle infestations have led to a complete change in the avifauna composition. The distinct, species-poor group that is found here includes some species that are generally decreasing in abundance in Central Europe. By calculating threshold values for the environmental variables which were identified as important, we were able to formulate the following concrete management recommendations:
   (1) To create conditions suitable for the whole range of species associated with openings in the canopy, the full spectrum of canopy-openness ranging from 5% to 70% should be realized on the stand scale throughout a whole forest landscape.
   (2) To sustain the whole range of cavity-breeding species and species of mature forests, the age of Central European mixed montane forests needs to surpass 200-220 years.
   (3) To support the deciduous forest species in mixed montane stands a minimum of 60% cover of deciduous trees at least in single stands that are maximally few kilometres apart is required.
   Among the threshold values, we identified cascade-like threshold sequences that represent the ecological niches of the individual species with respect to the environmental variables, which contrasts with species groups where the collective threshold value is a universal threshold that applies to the whole group.

AB  - Conventional agricultural practices (CAP) highly impacted soil functions involved in the provision of multiple ecosystem services. No-till (NT) has been repeatedly indicated as a key way to enhance soil fertility and biodiversity, while having a positive effect on the environment and climate change. However, experimental evidence to date shows contrasting effects of NT on physical parameters of soil fertility, as well as on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and soil biodiversity especially if different soil types and cropping systems are considered.
   The objectives of the present 7-year field study were: (i) to unravel the effect of NT on SOC, soil bulk density, and water stability index (WSI) of soil aggregates across five different soil types (Silty Clay, Silty Clay Loam, Clay Loam, Silt Loam, and Sandy Loam) and cropping systems (silage vs grain production), (ii) to examine how soil fauna (i.e. microarthropods and earthworms) is affected by NT practices under those soil-crop conditions, and (iii) to assess relationships among responses of soil physical indicators (i.e. soil bulk density and WSI), SOC, and soil fauna.
   Our results showed that soil bulk density was generally not affected by 7-year NT across all soil types. At the same time, NT increased WSI. It follows that NT may increase stable rather than artificial tillage-derived porosity due to reduced soil disturbance, and increased SOC and biological activity. However, reduced importance for boosting aggregates stability should be attributed to NT where initial SOC is high, clay and silt are predominant soil fractions, and the rate of crop residue is low.
   Our findings suggest that NT may enhance SOC stock (on average 0.66 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)) in the 0-30 cm soil layer. However, we found (i) a tendency of NT to decrease SOC concentration in the 15-30 cm soil layer (on average -1.18 g C kg(-1)), and (ii) no SOC increase induced by NT if crop residues were not left onto the soil surface.
   Nevertheless, NT practices promoted (i) the microarthropods adaptation measured with the QBS-ar index (105.5 vs 64.7), and (ii) the increase of earthworm abundance (412 vs 123 individuals m(-2)), which are fundamental for enhancing nutrient cycling and soil porosity.
   Correlations among soil fauna (i.e. QBS-ar and earthworm density), soil physical parameters (i.e. soil bulk density and WSI), and SOC (i.e. concentration and stock) corroborates the hypothesis that soil fauna adaptation and proliferation are main detectors of soil quality and sensitive indicators of changes in soil tillage.

AB  - A field-based investigation was conducted at a contaminated site where the vadose zone was contaminated with a range of chlorinated hydrocarbons. The investigation consisted of groundwater and multilevel soil-gas monitoring of a range of contaminants and gases, along with isotope measurements and microbiology studies. The investigation provided multiple lines of evidence that demonstrated aerobic biodegradation of vinyl chloride (VC) was occurring in the vadose zone (i) above the on-site source zone, and (ii) above the downgradient off-site groundwater plume location.
   Data from both the on-site and off-site locations were consistent in showing substantially greater (an order of magnitude greater) rates of VC removal from the aerobic vadose zone compared to more recalcitrant contaminants trichloroethene (TCE) and tetrachloroethene (PCE). Soil gas VC isotope analysis showed substantial isotopic enrichment of VC (delta C-13 - 5.2 to -10.9 parts per thousand) compared to groundwater (delta C-13 - 39.5 parts per thousand) at the on-site location. Soil gas CO2 isotope analysis at both locations showed that CO2 was highly isotopically depleted (delta C-13 - 28.8 to -33.3 parts per thousand), compared to soil gas CO2 data originating from natural sediment organic matter (delta C-13 = -14.7 to -21.3 parts per thousand). The soil gas CO2 delta C-13 values were consistent with near-water table VC groundwater delta C-13 values (-36.8 to -39.5 parts per thousand), suggesting CO2 originating from aerobic biodegradation of VC. Bacteria that had functional genes (ethene monooxygenase (etnC) and epoxyalkane transferase (etnE)) involved in ethene metabolism and VC oxidation were more abundant at the source zone where oxygen co-existed with VC.
   The distribution of VC and oxygen vadose zone vapour plumes, together with long-term changes in soil gas CO2 concentrations and temperature, provided information to elucidate the factors controlling aerobic biodegradation of VC in the vadose zone. Based on the overlapping VC and oxygen vadose zone vapour plumes, aerobic vapour biodegradation rates were independent of substrate (VC and/or oxygen) concentration. The high correlation (R = 0.962 to 0.975) between CO2 concentrations and temperature suggested that aerobic biodegradation of VC was controlled by bacterial activity that was regulated by the temperature within the vadose zone.
   When assessing a contaminated site for possible vapour intrusion into buildings, accounting for environmental conditions for aerobic biodegradation of VC in the vadose zone should improve the assessment of environmental risk of VC intrusion into buildings, enabling better identification and prioritisation of contaminated sites to be remediated.

AB  - Environmental risk assessment (ERA) of chemicals aims to protect populations, communities, and ecosystems. Population models are considered more frequent in ERA because they can bridge the gap between the individual and the population level. Lymnaea stagnalis (the great pond snail) is an organism that is particularly sensitive to various metals, including copper (Cu). In addition, the sensitivity of this species to Cu differs between food sources. The first goal of the present study was to investigate whether we could explain the variability in sensitivity between food sources (lettuce and fish flakes) at the individual level with a dynamic energy budget (DEB) model. By adapting an existing DEB model and calibrating it with Cu toxicity data, thereby combining information from 3 studies and 2 endpoints (growth and reproduction), we put forward inhibition of energy assimilation as the most plausible physiological mode of action (PMoA) of Cu. Furthermore, the variation in Cu sensitivity between both food sources was considerably lower at the PMoA level than at the individual level. Higher Cu sensitivity at individual level under conditions of lower food quality or availability appears to emerge from first DEB principles when inhibition of assimilation is the PMoA. This supports the idea that DEB explained Cu sensitivity variation between food sources. Our second goal was to investigate whether this food source effect propagated to the population level. By incorporating DEB in an individual-based model (IBM), population-level effects were predicted. Based on our simulations, the food source effect was still present at the population level, albeit less prominently. Finally, we compared predicted population-level effect concentration, x% (ECx) values with individual-level ECx values for different studies. Using the DEB-IBM, the range of effect concentrations decreased significantly: at the individual level, the difference in chronic EC10 values between studies was a factor of 70 (1.13-78 mu g dissolved Cu/L), whereas at the population level the difference was a factor of 15 (2.9-44.6 mu g dissolved Cu/L). To improve interstudy comparability, a bioavailability correction for differences in water chemistry was performed with a biotic ligand model. This further decreased the variation, down to a factor of 7.4. Applying the population model in combination with a bioavailability correction thus significantly decreased the variability of chronic effect concentrations of Cu for L. stagnalis. Overall, the results of the present study illustrate the potential usefulness of transitioning to a more modeling-based environmental risk assessment. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;00:1-16.

AB  - As an important constitute of land consolidation, high-standard basic farmland construction is an important means to protect the quantity, quality and ecological environment of cultivated land. Its target not only lies in the increase of cultivated land quantity, but also the improvement of cultivated land quality, agricultural production conditions and ecosystem environments. In the present study, the quality evaluation method and construction arrangement of cultivated land were explored to facilitate the process of decision-making and implementation for high-standard basic farmland construction (HSBFC) with administrative village as the unit. Taking the land comprehensive improvement project area in Quzhou County, Handan City, Hebei Province as a case study, the whole process of the study comprised of three steps: 1) establishment of the evaluation model of cultivated land quality uniformity based on regional optimum cultivated land quality, and construction of the uniformity evaluation index system from the aspects of soil fertility quality, engineering quality, spatial quality and eco-environment quality, according to the new concept of cultivated land quality; 2) calculation of cultivated land quality uniformity by grading indicators, assigning scores and weighting sums, exploring the local homogenization characteristics of regional cultivated land quality through spatial autocorrelation analysis, and analyzing the constraints and transformative potential of barrier factors; 3) arrangement of HSBFC according to the principle of concentration, continuity and priority to the easy operation. The results revealed that the value of farmland quality uniformity for the administrative villages in the study area was between 7.76 and 21.96, and there was a difference between various administrative villages. The regional spatial autocorrelation patterns included High-High (HH), Low-Low (LL), High-Low (HL) and Low-High (LH). These indicate that regional cultivated land quality has local homogenization characteristics. The most restrictive factors in the study area were the medium and low transformation difficulty indexes, including soil organic matter content, farmland shelterbelt network density, field regularity and scale of the field. In addition, there were also high transformation difficulty indicators in some areas, such as sectional configuration. The project area was divided into four partitions: major construction area, secondary construction area, general construction area, and conditional construction area. The cultivated land area of each subarea was 1538.85 ha, 1224.27 ha, 555.93 ha, and 1666.63 ha, respectively. This comprised of 30.87%, 24.56%, 11.15% and 33.42% of the total project area, respectively. The evaluation model and index system could satisfy the evaluation of farmland quality and diagnosis of obstacle factors to facilitate the subsequent construction decision. The present study provides reference for the practice of regional HSBFC, and a new feasible idea and method for related studies.

AB  - Long-term observations of the rates and pattern of changes in flora and vegetation contribute to understanding of one of the most important contemporary global problems, the eutrophication of water bodies. In this study, using classical floristic methods, we attempt to determine (for a period of almost 80 years) the nature and possible causes of changes in the floristic composition of the lakes of karst origin, Velikoe and Parovoe (Pustinskaya lake-river system, the right bank of Nizhny Novgorod oblast). The paper shows that over a long period of observations a significant transformation of the vegetation cover has occurred in the lakes. The process was accompanied by the disappearance of a number of native species and appearance of others, including adventitious ones (for example, Elodea canadensis Michx., Zizania latifolia (Griseb.) Stapf, Bidens frondosa L. and Epilobium adenocaulon Hausskn.). The weak saturation of the flora with adventive species indicates that the reservoirs are subject to moderate anthropogenic transformation. This is also indicated by the presence of characteristic indicator species, for example, Najas minor All., Glyceria fluitans (L.) R. Br., Hydrocharis morsus-ranae L. and Stratiotes aloides L. in the plant communities. In addition, the studied water bodies are subject to a further increase in the degree of eutrophication. This can be judged by scattered records of Potamogeton trichoides Cham. et Schlecht., the disappearance of a number of species (such as Elatine alsinastrum L. and Callitriche hermaphroditica L.), as well as the presence of a significant number of macrophyte indicators of the eutrophic state of water bodies. We suggest that a gradual increase in the trophicity of the studied water bodies is due to a combination of anthropogenic impact (water withdrawal for economic needs, recreational load), natural and climatic features of the region (alternation of high and low water periods) and the natural succession processes associated with the current fundamental changes in the conditions of the runoff formation in the Volga River basin. As a result of studies conducted by authors in 2014-2015, it has been shown that in general the taxonomic and ecological structures of the flora of both lakes are quite diverse and traditional for the territory and the European part of Russia. Meanwhile, the flora of these two reservoirs insignificantly differs in taxonomic composition, which is due to their individual morphometric characteristics, the physical and chemical properties of the aquatic environment, and the nature of the anthropogenic load. At the same time, the equilibrium balance of coastal and aquatic plants in the flora of Lake Parovoe (in contrast to Lake Velikoe) indicates a degree of successional stability of its floristic complex.

AB  - One of the bioindicators most often applied to assess the quality of soil is its enzymatic activity. Undesirable changes in the activity of enzymes can imply excessive presence of substances which are harmful to soil environment, such as heavy metals. Being a heavy metal, zinc is also an element essential for maintaining proper functions of live organisms. The purpose of this study has been to determine the significance of changes occurring in moderately heavy soil under the influence of zinc.
   The experiment was carried out in three replicates under laboratory conditions. Sandy loams of pH 5.5 and 7.0 were used for the trials. The soils were contaminated with zinc according to the following design: control (natural content), raised content (70 mg Zn2+ kg(-1)), weakly polluted (200 mg Zn2+ kg(-1)), moderately polluted (500 mg Zn2+ kg(-1)), heavily polluted (1,500 mg Zn2+ kg(-1)) and very heavily polluted soil (5,000 mg and 10,000 mg Zn2+ kg(-1)). The soil samples prepared as above were brought to the moisture content of 50% maximum water capacity and incubated at 25 degrees C for 120 days. On day 30, 60 and 120, the activity of dehydrogenases, beta-glucosidase, urease, acid phosphatase and arylsulphatase was determined. Based on these determinations, the following indices were calculated: ED50, the index for resistance (RS) and the index for resilience (RL).
   The tests have demonstrated that as the rate of soil contamination with zinc increased, the activity of all the analyzed enzymes was significantly depressed. The negative influence of zinc contamination on the activity of particular enzymes, irrespective of the soil pH, persisted throughout the whole experiment. In respect of their sensitivity to zinc, the enzymes can be ordered as follows: arylsulphatase > dehydrogenases > acid phosphatase > urease > beta-glucosidase. Zinc contamination caused lasting changes in the soil environment, but the return to the state of equilibrium was the quickest in the case of dehydrogenases (RL = 0.276), less rapid for arylsulphatase (RL = 0.173) and the slowest for acid phosphatase (RL = 0.064). In contrast, the activity of urease, instead of regenerating, was increasingly disturbed (RL = 0.350). Soil acidification was the factor that most evidently exacerbated the negative influence of zinc on the activity of beta-glucosidase and arylsulphatase. Values of ED50 for the activity of particular enzymes were varied. In the soil of pH 7.0, they ranged from 3,324 mg Zn2+ kg(-1) for beta-glucosidase to 412 mg Zn2+ kg(-1) for dehydrogenases, and in the soil of pH 5.5, they varied from 1,008 Zn2+ kg(-1) for beta-glucosidase to 280 mg Zn2+ kg(-1) for arylsulphatase.

AB  - Radiocarbon (C-14) is a key tracer for detecting the mobilization of previously stored terrestrial organic carbon (C) into aquatic systems. Old C (>1,000years BP) may be masked by postbomb C (fixed from the atmosphere post-1950 CE), potentially rendering bulk aquatic dissolved organic C (DOC) C-14 measurements insensitive to old C. We collected DOC with a modern C-14 signature from a temperate Scottish peatland stream and decomposed it to produce CO2 under simulated natural conditions over 140days. We measured the C-14 of both DOC and CO2 at seven time points and found that while DOC remained close to modern in age, the resultant CO2 progressively increased in age up to 2,356767years BP. The results of this experiment demonstrate that the bulk (DOC)-C-14 pool can hide the presence of old C within peatland stream DOC export, demonstrating that bulk (DOC)-C-14 measurements can be an insensitive indicator of peatland disturbance. Our experiment also demonstrates that this old C component is biologically and photochemically available for conversion to the greenhouse gas CO2, and as such, bulk (DOC)-C-14 measurements do not reflect the C-14 signature of the labile organic C pool exported by inland water systems more broadly. Moreover, our experiment suggests that old C may be an important component of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from peatland aquatic systems, with implications for tracing and modeling interactions between the hydrological and terrestrial C cycles.
   Plain Language Summary The introduction of old carbon previously stored in soils for thousands of years into rivers can increase the net flux of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, impacting global climate. This is because rivers transport the equivalent of one third of human carbon emissions annually from land to the oceans. Much river-borne carbon is plant and soil (organic) matter that can decompose during transport, releasing greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Radiocarbon dating can reveal the age of river-borne carbon, but previous measurements may have underestimated the age of carbon released into rivers by not considering the potential for old carbon hidden within individual bulk water samples. Using an incubation experiment, we demonstrate that dissolved organic carbon from a Scottish peatland stream that would be considered modern in age using traditional bulk radiocarbon dating can readily decompose to produce carbon dioxide with an old radiocarbon signature up to similar to 2,500years old. This demonstrates that radiocarbon dating of bulk riverine dissolved organic carbon can hide the presence of old carbon. Furthermore, these results indicate that old carbon may be more common in the global carbon cycle than previously thought, with important implications for our understanding and modeling of peatland ecosystems.

AB  - As a measure of energy "quality", exergy is meaningful for comparing the potential for thermal storage. Systems containing the same amount of energy could have considerably different capabilities in matching a demand profile, and exergy measures this difference. Exergy stored in the envelope of buildings is central in sustainability because the environment could be an unlimited source of energy if its interaction with the envelope is optimised for maintaining the indoor conditions within comfort ranges. Since the occurring phenomena are highly fluctuating, a dynamic exergy analysis is required; however, dynamic exergy modelling is complex and has not hitherto been implemented in building simulation tools. Simplified energy and exergy assessments are presented for a case study in which thermal storage determines the performance of seven different wall types for utilising nocturnal ventilation as a passive cooling strategy. Hourly temperatures within the walls are obtained with the ESP-r software in free-floating operation and are used to assess the envelope exergy storage capacity. The results for the most suitable wall types were different between the exergy analysis and the more traditional energy performance indicators. The exergy method is an effective technique for selecting the construction type that results in the most favourable free-floating conditions through the analysed passive strategy.

AB  - A series of experiments have been made in a wind tunnel to investigate the ventilation of snow by shear. We argue that the zero-plane displacement can be used as a convenient indicator of ventilation, and that this can be obtained from measurements of mean velocity profiles in conditions of zero pressure gradient. Measurements made over a natural snow surface show a zero-plane displacement depth of less than 5 mm, but practical considerations preclude extensive use of snow for these measurements. Instead, the influence of permeability is investigated using reticulated foams in place of snow. We demonstrate that the foam and snow have similar structure and flow-relevant properties. Although the surface of the foam is flat, the roughness lengths increase by two orders of magnitude as the permeability increases from 6 x 10(-9) to 160 x 10(-9) m(2). The zero-plane displacement for the least permeable foams is effectively zero, but more than 15 mm for the most permeable foams. Our data compare well to the few studies available in the literature. By analogy to conditions over snow surfaces, we suggest that shear-driven ventilation of snow is therefore limited to the upper few millimetres of snow surfaces.

AB  - Many laboratory rodents emit ultrasonic vocalizations. The purpose of this review is to highlight the types and functions of ultrasonic vocalizations emitted by laboratory rats and mice. Rats emit 3 types of ultrasonic vocalizations, depending on the animal's age, its environmental conditions, and its affective state. Rat pups emit a 40-kHz vocalization when they are separated from their mothers. Adult rats emit a 22-kHz vocalization in anticipation of inescapable aversive stimuli. These two types of vocalizations reflect a negative affective state of the animal. Rats produce a 50-kHz vocalization under nonaversive conditions, and these vocalizations reflect a positive affective state of the animal. Adult mice produce several different types of ultrasonic calls that can be classified as different syllables. Mice produce ultrasonic vocalizations during nonaggressive interactions, particularly during mating behaviors, but these vocalizations are not indicators of negative or positive affect. Therefore, the function of ultrasonic vocalizations in adult mice is likely only to facilitate or inhibit social interactions. Understanding the types and functions of ultrasonic vocalizations emitted by laboratory rodents may enable researchers and animal care personnel to use vocalizations as an indicator of an animal's behavior and affect.

AB  - Photosynthetic carbon isotope composition (delta(13)C) was measured on sugars in mature fruits from field-grown grapevines. Sugar delta(13)C and summer predawn leaf water potential were significantly correlated. The survey of different vineyards during four growing seasons showed that sugar delta(13)C in must at harvest varied from -20parts per thousand to -26parts per thousand when conditions during berry maturation varied from dry to wet. This range allows a very sensitive detection of grapevine water status under natural conditions. However, local differences due to soil capacity to supply water to grapevines are maintained, whatever the annual water balance. Leaf nitrogen content variations of field-grown grapevines did not change delta(13)C values. Genetic variability of delta(13)C between 31 grapevine varieties for delta(13)C was observed. Must sugar delta(13)C can be used to characterize vineyards for their soil structural capacity to provide water to grapevines. It was concluded that isotope carbon composition in grapevine measured on sugars at harvest can be applied to compare the capacities of vineyard soils and canopy management to induce mild water stress in order to produce premium wines.

AB  - Poly(dI-dC) . poly(dI-dC) was studied using vibrational circular dichroism and IR spectroscopy in both the base deformation C=O and symmetric PO2- stretching regions. VCD spectra of this duplex under low salt conditions are consistent with its having a B-form structure. Addition of 5 M NaCl leads to relatively uniform VCD intensity loss which is consistent with loss of helical structure rather than formation of an intermediate state between the B and Z forms. This duplex polymer under high salt conditions with added NiCl2 shows aggregation effects, but its IR and VCD spectra have characteristic features of the Z-form DNA conformation. The cooperative change of backbone and base pair structure upon thermal denaturation is indicated by the simultaneous collapse of the VCD at 65-degrees-C in both the PO2- and C=O stretching regions. This study further demonstrates that the VCD bandshape of a specific localized nucleic acid vibrational transition can be a useful indicator of the helical handedness. The empirical conformational interpretations are supported by simulated VCD spectra, which are in excellent agreement with the experimental results, based on dipole coupling calculations.

TI  - LARGE, OPEN-GROWN TREES AS INDICATORS OF PRESETTLEMENT SAVANNA
T2  - NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - The presence of very large, open-grown oaks has been suggested as an indicator of presettlement savanna. Increment cores taken from seven large-diameter (85-160 cm), open-grown bur oaks in a central Illinois prairie grove (Funk's Grove, McLean County) indicate that these trees were much younger than expected and, therefore, could not serve as indicators of the presettlement condition at this site. We caution natural area managers that the presence of even the largest of open-grown trees may not indicate presettlement savanna.

AB  - Functional aspects of biodiversity were investigated in a lowland tropical rainforest in French Guyana (5 degrees 2'N, annual precipitation 2200 mm). We assessed leaf delta(15)N as a presumptive indicator of symbiotic N-2 fixation, and leaf and wood cellulose delta(13)C as an indicator of leaf intrinsic water-use efficiency (CO assimilation rate/leaf conductance for water vapour) in dominant trees of 21 species selected for their representativeness in the forest cover, their ecological strategy (pioneers or late successional stage species, shade tolerance) or their potential ability for N-2 fixation. Similar measurements were made in trees of native species growing in a nearby plantation after severe perturbation (clear cutting, mechanical soil disturbance). Bulk soil delta(15)N was spatially quite uniform in the forest (range 3-5%), whereas average leaf delta(15)N ranged from -0.3% to 3.5% in the different species. Three species only, Diplotropis purpurea, Recordoxylon speciosum (Fabaceae), and sclerolobium melinonii (Caesalpiniaceae), had root bacterial nodules, which was also associated with leaf N concentrations higher than 20 mg g(-1). Although nodulated trees displayed significantly lower leaf delta(15)N values than non-nodulated trees. leaf delta(15)N did not prove a straightforward indicator of symbiotic fixation, since there was a clear overlap of delta(15)N values for nodulated and non-nodulated species at the lower end of the delta(15)N range. Perturbation did not markedly affect the difference delta(15)N(soil) - delta(15)N(leaf), and thus the isotopic data provide no evidence of an alteration in the different N acquisition patterns. Extremely large interspecific differences in sunlit leaf delta(13)C were observed in the forest (average values from -31.4 to -26.7%), corresponding to intrinsic water-use efficiencies (ratio CO2 assimilation rate/leaf conductance for water vapour) varying over a threefold range. Wood cellulose delta(13)C was positively related to total leaf delta(13)C. the former values being 2-3% higher than the latter ones. Leaf delta(13)C was not related to leaf delta(15)N at either intraspecific or interspecific levels. delta(13)C of sunlit leaves was highest in shade hemitolerant emergent species and was lower in heliophilic, but also in shade-tolerant species. For a given species, leaf delta(13)C did not differ between the pristine forest and the disturbed plantation conditions. Our results are not in accord with the concept of existence of functional types of species characterized by common suites of traits underlying niche differentiation; rather, they support the hypothesis that each trait leads to a separate grouping of species.

AB  - Native freshwater mussels are a guild of benthic, filter feeding invertebrates that perform important ecological functions in rivers. Because of their long lifespans (30-50 years or longer), mussels are slow to respond to human-induced alterations. Thus, development of sensitive indicators of mussel population responses to river conditions and management would be beneficial. Compared to marine species, estimation of vital rates (e.g. survival, growth) in freshwater mussels has received little attention. We placed passively integrated transponder tags on 578 mussels of four species (Amblema plicata,Cyclonaias pustulosa,Obliquaria reflexa, andPleurobema sintoxia) in a well-studied mussel assemblage in a side channel of the upper Mississippi River. Growth and survival of tagged mussels were assessed annually for 4 years across core (high density) and peripheral (low density) areas of the assemblage. Overall survival was highly variable, ranging fromc. 15 to 90%, and was related to life history, habitat quality, and hydrologic events. Survival, which varied significantly among species and over time, was consistently higher in the dense and species-rich core of the mussel assemblage, relative to the periphery because substrates were consistently more stable in the core of the mussel bed relative to the periphery. Substrate movement during low flows was an order of magnitude lower in the core relative to the periphery, and survival was inversely related to stability of river substrates. Patterns in habitat-specific survival indicate source-sink population dynamics such that mussels in the core habitat provide recruitment to the periphery, but mussels in the periphery are subject to unsustainably low survival; additional studies to track the source of recruitment in the periphery are needed to test this hypothesis. Growth rate did not vary significantly between core and peripheral areas but did vary by species. Growth rate (proportional change per year) declined with age, and was similar at mean age forA. plicata(0.016 per year),P. sintoxia(0.015 per year), andC. pustulosa(0.013 per year), but much lower forO. reflexa(0.008 per year). Effective management decisions for mussels requires a better understanding of how vital rates govern populations and how they vary across a suite of physical and biological factors. Information on how population vital rates vary among species and over time gives managers another tool to understand how mussels may respond to management actions such as habitat restoration projects. Given the importance of substrate stability inferred from this study, management actions that maintain or increase substrate stability are likely to result in high quality mussel assemblages and may restore a valuable component of ecosystem function in this region.

AB  - The relevance of the research topic. The article deals with the essence of the transcendental approach to determining the content of accounting systems, which the authors propose for praxological use not by philosophical interpretation (unknowable) but by linguistic understanding (what goes beyond) and subjective active perception (something no one used). It is proved that the definitive formogenesis of national wealth allows to determine the factors of legitimization of its use as a system-forming basis of existential-humanistic foundations of awareness of social relations and their quantitative reflection in accounting systems. Methodological approaches to the formation of national wealth by its system-forming elements have been improved through a combination of general theoretical and specifically historical approaches to understanding both the very essence of wealth and the broader sources and economic mechanisms of its accumulation and social distribution. It is substantiated that the methodological foundations of accounting and informational display of national wealth are structured by organizational provisions of accounting policy, which is detailed as an inter-level accounting and synthetic service of accentuated objectification of a research object.
   Goal. To study the theoretical and methodological provisions for substantiating the coherence of accounting systems, taking into account the transcendence of their content and the immanence of purpose in the plane of instrumental support for service management. Methods. The methodological basis of the study is the philosophical and general scientific methods of cognition of the transcendence of their content and immanence of purpose in the plane of instrumental support of service management. Results. The scientific plane of the generalizations made has become a reliable support not only for the systematization of multi-vector calculus, but also for the improvement of methodological approaches to the formation of national wealth by its system-forming elements through the combination of general theoretical and concrete historical approaches to understanding as the most economical nature and the essence of the mechanism accumulation and social distribution. In particular, we propose to use a complex accounting methodology of epistemological dispersion of components of national wealth, which is based on the consideration of the sectoral specificity of different types of its potential, which is a dominant condition in the system of priorities of the respective stages of socio-economic growth. Conceptual approaches to the construction of accounting standard of social and environmental responsibility of business are systematized. The methodology for assessing national wealth, including its biological component in the context of nature-man dual communication, is presented. According to the results of accounting and information monitoring, the criterion apodicticity of the indicative verification of the growth of national wealth was factualized. In particular, multivariate indicator systems are dispersed in accordance with the level differentiation of the management itself.

AB  - Microbial precipitation of calcium carbonate has played a vital role in the development of carbonate platforms since their initiation in the Proterozoic. We report here the varied roles that microbial carbonates played in Late Devonian carbonate platforms in the Alberta basin, Canada. We recognize microbial carbonates as important contributors within the carbonate system during times of major environmental change including transgressive events in platform environments and the recovery interval following the Frasnian-Famennian mass extinction. Detailed sequence stratigraphic analysis of two isolated platforms in the Canadian Rockies was used to document their evolution from a regional ramp to isolated platforms with phases of progradation, aggradation and backstepping, and renewed progradation related to rates of second-order and third-order sea-level change and basin infill. The carbonate system was reorganized following annihilation of many carbonate-producing biota during the Frasnian-Famennian mass extinction. Microbial carbonates figure prominently in both Frasnian platform development and the Famennian recovery of the carbonate system following the Frasnian-Famennian mass extinction. During transgressive platform phases deeper-water facies with a crinoid, rugose coral, and microbe dominated biota abruptly overlie prograding stromatoporoid framestones. Microbial carbonates consist of abundant Girvinellid oncoids that nucleated around other fossil clasts. The temporary replacement of stromatoporoid communities during transgression implies a shift from oligotrophic to mesotrophic conditions and the microbes likely capitalized on the change in nutrient supply. Microbes played a significant role in highstand reef margin facies where Renalcis was a binder and cementer in stromatoporoid framestones and downslope rugose coral/stromatoporoid mounds. Microbially laminated carbonates also form stromatolitic mats in peritidal shallowing-upward cycles and repetitive stromatolitic intervals commonly indicate sea-level lowstands associated with the development of sequence boundaries. Stromatoporoid reefs and their associated reef interior facies indicate an oligotrophic ecosystem where microbial carbonates were relegated mainly to cryptic or stressed marine habitats. An end-Frasnian sea-level lowstand exposed the isolated carbonate platforms. Transgression and mass extinction characterize the Frasnian-Famennian boundary event and microbial carbonates occur at this horizon in western Canada. Stromatolites, oncoids, and large-scale microbial thrombolites appear to be opportunistic taxa temporarily filling unoccupied ecological niches immediately above the extinction boundary. The paucity of megafauna implies that few metazoans remained to exploit available food and nutrient sources and the stratigraphic position of these microbial carbonates supports their interpretation as 'disaster forms'. Microbial carbonates thus play several significant roles in the development of Late Devonian carbonate systems in western Canada. Microbial carbonates occur at important sequence stratigraphic and paleoecologic horizons indicating changes in sea level, nutrient supply, and biotic assemblages. These examples indicate that microbial carbonates can be important indicators of environmental and ecological change within carbonate systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The research was directed to confirming or disproving the hypothesis that increasing tax pressure on the forest industry encourages the irrational use of forest resources to cover tax payments. The purpose of the study is to develop a methodology for identifying the impact of taxes on the activities of forest enterprises in Ukraine, social and natural capital. In this study, we try to identify the causes of the increased tax burden and the impact of this process on forest conservation. The following decisions of the Government of Ukraine have been taken into account: ban on export of timber products in 2015; an increase in the rent for the use of forest resources in 2016; expiration of special VAT regime from January 1, 2017, introduction of land tax on forest lands from January 1, 2019, increase of deductions from net profit to the state budget from 75 to 90%.
   Information bases of research are the survey has been conducted, the statistic reporting, reporting to the State Forest Resources Agency and financial reporting of forestry enterprises. By means of methods of the econometric analysis, it is studied indicators relations of the amount of the paid taxes and the area of logging, the amount of the paid taxes and the area of restoration of the wood from 2010 to 2019. The impact of tax increases on the financial condition of forest enterprises was analyzed. The social effect was analyzed by studying the dynamics of payment of wage taxes, the environmental effect was analyzed by indicators of growth of areas of forest restoration including areas of planting a new forest. By results of the analysis of data of the State committee of statistics and the reporting of 17 state enterprises of the Volyn region which serve 7% of the total area of the woods of Ukraine it is established: tax revenues from forest enterprises have tripled, what is not related to the increase in profitability of their activities; reduction of the number of dividends paid in favor of the state; the total sectorial profitability of the activity decreased more than 6 times; bankruptcy is on the rise, and at the end of 2019 accounts for nearly half (65%) of all operating entities. The constructed econometric model allows us to claim with probability p = 0.95 that the increase in tax payments leads to an increase in the volume of harvesting although taxes should stimulate the economical use of forest resources. The results show that all government decisions as to increasing fiscal pressure on forestry enterprises were unsystematic and lead the industry into bankruptcy. This has a detrimental effect on the ecology of the region as forestry grows. However, instead of developing the industry, these studies indicate a complete decline as enterprises lack the resources to forestry development.

AB  - A shift from restoring coastal dunes as stabilized landscapes toward more morphodynamic ecosystems is underway. This paper uses results from a recent case study where invasive vegetation was removed from a coastal dune complex in western Canada as a first step in a dynamic ecosystem restoration project. Spatial statistical methods, used in the natural sciences to quantify patterns of significant spatial-temporal changes, are reviewed and the local Moran's I-i spatial autocorrelation statistic is explored for detecting and assessing significant changes. Cluster maps of positive (depositional) and negative (erosional) changes were used to derive statistically significant volumetric changes within discrete geomorphic units (beach, foredune, transgressive dune) over one year following vegetation removal. All units experienced net increases in sediment budgets compared to a pre-restoration surface. The beach experienced the highest episodic erosion and volumetric change and greatest net annual sediment budget. Compared to the beach, the annual sediment budget of the foredune was 19% whereas the transgressive dune was 33%. The foredune recovered rapidly to initial erosion during restoration and subsequent natural events with consistently positive sediment volumes and attained a form similar to that pre-restoration. Aeolian deflation and sand bypassing through the foredune was greatest in the two months following vegetation removal and peak accretion in the transgressive dune resulted from depositional lobes extending from the foredune, smaller dunes migrating within the complex, and growth of a precipitation ridge along the eastern margin.
   Several methodological and logistical considerations for detecting significant change in dynamic dune landscapes are discussed including sampling strategy design, data normalization and control measures, and incorporating uncertainty and inherent spatial relations within acquired datasets to ensure accuracy and comparability of results. Generally underutilized in coastal geomorphology, spatial autocorrelation methods (e.g., local Moran's If) are recommended over spatially uniform threshold approaches for the ability to detect local change processes and explore hypotheses on spatial-temporal dynamics.
   Finally, several key geomorphic indicators, that are believed to aid in re-establishing ecological conditions and processes that favor more resilient and natural dune ecosystems, are identified for assessing the effectiveness of dynamic restoration projects including: increased aeolian activity, enlarged active sand surface area, positive sediment budgets, increased dune morphodynamics, improved geomorphic diversity, and enhanced geomorphic resilience. Although limited in temporal scope, the case study results show that the initial phase of the restoration treatment was effective in enhancing all indicators except for increasing sand surface area. Given decadal scale observations of climatic changes and longer-term eco-geomorphic trajectory toward stabilization in the region, however, it is unlikely that the geomorphic effectiveness of this restoration effort will continue without continued frequent treatment interventions.

AB  - Forest ground vegetation constitutes the largest number of plant species that participate in forest dynamics. Single species or species groups of forest ground vegetation can be used as indicators for site conditions. Ground vegetation has to be accounted in forest simulation modeling if biodiversity dynamics are evaluated to serve the purpose of sustainable forest management. The usual approach is to segregate ground vegetation into plant functional types. However, there are other methods that could be used. In our contribution we propose to split ground vegetation into ecological-coenotic species groups. An application of the ecological-coenotic approach allowed for a forecasting of the dynamics of forest ground vegetation diversity on the basis of forest ecosystem modeling outputs, standard forest inventory data, and regional phytosociological data sets. A new software BioCalc designed for the forecasting of dynamics of forest ground vegetation diversity, and the EFIMOD model of the forest growth and element cycling in the forest-soil system is used for simulating the forest ecosystem parameters under different forest management regimes.
   An application of the proposed method for a study area situated in the Central European Russia is discussed. Two hundred-year dynamics of ground vegetation composition, forest types and species diversity is analysed under four forest management scenarios: NAT, natural development; SCU, selective cuttings; LRU, authorized by Russian legislation clear cuttings; ILL, non-authorized by the legislation but widespread clear cuttings. The simulation results showed that the total number of forest types is higher in all scenarios with cuttings relative to the NAT scenario. However, the NAT strategy leads to the growth of coniferous-broad-leaved forests close to the climax forest type of the study area. Cuttings hinder the development of climax forest structure due to the low level of deadwood in harvested forests and the absence of species-rich forest units dominated by nitrophilous tall herbs in the understorey. The NAT strategy leads to the highest species diversity in ground vegetation if a free forest development has taken place for rather long time, i.e. more than 100 years in the study area. The sum of species diversity is rather low for SCU, LRU, and ILL scenarios. It is 0.8, 0.7, and 0.6, respectively, in comparison with the NAT scenario. The SCU scenario lead to a simplification of ground vegetation together with a conservation of nemoral and boreal species. Scenarios with clear cuttings (LRU and ILL) maintain piny and meadow groups in ground vegetation.
   None of the forest management scenario leads to the maintenance of the whole set of ecological-coenotic groups in ground vegetation. Only a spatial combination of different management regimes in the forest area is necessary for the biodiversity restoration and maintenance. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The success of a monitoring programme depends on the precision and accuracy of assessment tools, on the costs of sampling and laboratory procedures, on the time lag between sampling and the availability of the results. Aquatic ecosystem monitoring programmes using macroinvertebrates, developed in compliance with the EC Water Framework Directive, are constrained by assessment tools which require economically expensive activities and long time lags. This research investigates the adequacy of simplified sampling procedures, based on the selection of large body-size macroinvertebrates, retained by a 2 mm mesh size sieve, to detect the ecological status of a Mediterranean lagoon. To this aim, various tools for assessment of lagoon ecological status were compared, using three macroinvertebrate datasets obtained by field sieving with 2 mm, 1 mm and 0.5 mm sizes of mesh sieves. Simple community descriptors (numerical density, taxonomic richness, biomass density and individual body-size), taxonomic diversity indices (Shannon-Weaver, Margalef, Pielou, Average Taxonomic Distinctness) and ecological indicators sensu WFD (AMBI, BENTIX, BITS, M-AMBI) were used as assessment tools. In September 2009, three soft bottom samples of 0.1 m(2) were collected, sieved through the column of sieves, at seven study sites located along a Total Pressure gradient of Lesina lagoon (Italy). Three datasets were obtained with the macroinvertebrates retained by the 2 mm mesh sieve (2mm), the 1 mm and 2 mm sieves (1 mm) and the 0.5 mm, 1 mm and 2 mm sieves (0.5mm). The manual sorting time was also recorded for each sample and compared across the three datasets. Taxonomic richness, numerical and biomass densities were significantly higher in the 0.5mm than the 1mm and 2mm datasets, as expected. Nevertheless, the ecological indicators classified the study sites in the same EQS class with all datasets in 64% of cases; comparing the 2mm and 0.5mm datasets, the 2mm and 1mm datasets and the 0.5mm and 1mm datasets, the percentages were 64%, 80% and 86%, respectively. Individual body-size, AMBI, BENTIX were significantly correlated with Total Pressure at each dataset, M-AMBI at 1mm and 2mm and biomass density only at 2mm. The manual sorting time was 56% shorter for the large body-size macroinvertebrate fraction than for the 1mm, and 72% shorter than for the 0.5mm. Finally, the larger body-size macroinvertebrates seem to be advantageous and useful for accurate, rapid and cost effective biomonitoring. Further investigations to define reference conditions for each mesh are still needed, mainly for body-size based ecological indicators. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessing the resilience of the belt and road countries and its spatial heterogeneity: A comprehensive approach

KW  - REGIONAL RESILIENCE
AB  - Regional resilience refers to the resilience of a country or region against the ecological environment, social economy, and other internal and external natural factors and human factors in the process of development. When this resilience is lower than a certain critical threshold, the country or region will be in a fragile state. The comprehensive embodiment of ecological resilience, social resilience, and economic resilience of a country or region is regional resilience. Due to the wide range of countries along "the Belt and Road", differences in natural background conditions and stages of economic and social development among different countries lead to different degrees of vulnerability, and the improvement of resilience is conducive to reducing vulnerability. At the same time, the research on the measurement and differentiation characteristics of regional resilience is of considerable significance to solve the weak foundation of environmental management and the lack of ability to deal with climate change of "the Belt and Road" countries. In this study, by using entropy weighting method and multi-index comprehensive evaluation method, 24 specific indicators are selected from three different dimensions: ecology, economy, and society, to construct a comprehensive evaluation index system about "the Belt and Road" countries resilience, and to evaluate the comprehensive resilience and spatial heterogeneity characteristics of China and 64 countries along "the Belt and Road", and use multiple linear regression analysis to identify the main influencing factors of comprehensive resilience and analyze its influencing mechanism. According to the research, the overall resilience level of "the Belt and Road" countries shows prominent differentiation characteristics of "extreme difference", the countries with low and low recovery status account for the vast majority; and the spatial differentiation characteristics of the levels of ecological resilience, economic resilience, and social resilience of countries along "the Belt and Road" are quite different. In countries with high levels of economic development, their comprehensive resilience is significantly higher than that of countries with low levels of economic development. There is no inevitable connection between a country's economic growth rate and its comprehensive resilience level. At the same time, the relationship between resource richness and comprehensive resilience of countries is not apparent, but for those countries that are over-dependent on resources, the level of resilience is generally below. There is a certain degree of correspondence between urbanization rate and comprehensive resilience, that is, the comprehensive resilience will increase with the increase of urbanization rate. When the urbanization rate rises to a certain level, the level of comprehensive resilience does not change much. In this study, it provides scientific guidance for enriching regional resilience and national sustainable development theory, solving the fragile ecological environment foundation of "the Belt and Road" countries, speeding up the transformation of economic growth mode and dealing with a series of social problems.

AB  - Large benthic foraminifera (LBF) are important components of tropical shallow-marine ecosystems, in which they are abundant on both coral reefs and in the inter-reef areas. These protists are, similar to reef-building corals, photosymbiotic, restricted to warm (> 14 degrees C) seawater temperatures, and to benthic habitats within the photic zone. Because of their abundance, similarities to corals, short life-spans, and sensitivity to water quality, LBF are widely applied in environmental assessments of reef habitats.
   I review data on alive LBF assemblages within their environmental context. To be able to do so, I review the occurrences of individual species of the, in most environments, most abundant Central Indo-Pacific LBF, the Amphisteginidae, Calcarinidae, and Nummulitidae. In doing so I highlight the large uncertainties with respect to ecophenotypic and genetic variation among populations. In each of these families there appears to be substantial cryptic diversity, and thorough investigation using new morphological techniques results in higher diversity than previously known.
   Field observations of LBF show that nutrient availability, hydrodynamic energy, light intensity and spectrum, substrate type (sand, rubble, rubble with sand, algae, sea grass), and temperature are important environmental parameters for the occurrence of individual species. Many of these parameters are interrelated and are in some way influenced by water depth at least in part because occurrences have been related to conditions in the overlying watercolumn, and not to the microhabitat within the benthic boundary layer where the LBF live. In addition, I argue that differences in tolerance to terrestrial influence among species plays a large role in the occurrences of LBF, not only on the predominantly hard substratum reefs, but also in the predominantly sandy substratum inter-reef areas. Hence, there are distinct assemblages on reefs surrounded by deep, oceanic water, compared to terrestrially influenced reefs.
   Furthermore, assemblage composition is not only determined by water-quality parameters, but also by ecological dynamics of the benthic habitat on coral reefs, including shifts away from high coral cover. Abrupt changes resulting in permanent or temporal changes in the benthic habitat of coral reefs result in changes in the LBF assemblage. Especially calcarinids become more abundant with increased algal cover.
   Assemblage composition of benthic foraminifera, especially the weighted contribution of LBF to the total benthic foraminifera assemblage (the FoRAM Index), has been used to provide an assessment of water quality. Here I show that, in the Central Indo-Pacific, several species of LBF can occur abundantly in nearshore settings experiencing high terrestrial run-off. For a more consistent application of this method, the sampling and processing protocols (e.g., depth, sieve fractions included) should be standardised. Furthermore, differences in regional species pools require regional calibrations of the method, or finding alternative ways of simple assessments of reef quality using LBF.

AB  - Freshwater molluscs serve as test objects in the ecological monitoring of the environment, because they are able to extract in indicator quantity from the environment and accumulate in their bodies radionuclides, various macro- and micronutrients, toxic substances of inorganic and organic origin, and so on. The gastropods are a taxonomically diverse, ecologically plastic and rather widespread group of aquatic organisms, whose role in the life of freshwater ecosystems is very important. Molluscs often have various interactions in biogeocenoses that determines their trophic net. As a rule, these interactions occur in the form of ectocommensalism, endocommensalism, supercrescence, predation or parasitism. The latter type of interaction is the subject of many studies, but the epibionts of gastropods and bivalves are practically not studied and that causes the relevance of the research. Species composition of algal epibionts identifies specific sensitivity to the effects of certain environmental factors and reflects the processes occurring in water bodies of its ecosystem. This determines their efficient use for analyzing changes of water bodies, particularly in terms of complex anthropogenic pressure on aquatic ecosystems, as aquatic habitat. The aim of the research was to determine the ecological characteristics of algal communities on gastropod shells: Lymnaea stagnalis, L. auricularia and Viviparus viviparus (the Uzh river, Korosten district, Zhytomyr region). Identified microalgae communities were grouped and studied according to such indices as: confinedness to the habitat (substrate), temperature, fluidity and water oxygenating, saprobiological characteristics according to the Pantle-Buck system in the modification of Sladecek and Watanabe, salinity according to Kolbe's system, pH at Hustedt scale in the interpretation of M. M. Davydova and geographical confinedness of objects of study. Algae fouling on shells L. stagnalis, L. auricularia and V. viviparous are formed by benthic and benthic-planktonic species. Algal epibionts of studied communities are mainly confined to slowflowing waters. The basis of a floristic list according to the temperature in all studied groups of gastropods formed indifferent species. According to geographical distribution of algae fouling cosmopolitan species dominated. In relation to salinity according to Kolbe's system, most discovered species were indifferent oligo-galob. Algal communities are reliable indicators of one of the important indices of watercourse hydrochemical conditions - pH of water. Analysis of algal epibionts on gastropod shells of the river Uzh, showed the dominance of alkaliphiles and indifferent species (from the number of identified microalgae). According to saprobiological characteristic of water quality of the river Uzh predominance of o-saprobes. Analysis of indicator groups showed that the most numerous algal epibionts on shells were euresaprobe species. A detailed ecological and geographical characteristic of algae fouling on shells of studied groups of molluscs allows to predict the state of hydrocenose, that is an important aspect of monitoring and requires further research to model the influence of anthropogenic factors on the state of waters.

AB  - Interest in climate change research has taken on new relevance with the realization that human activities, such as the accelerated release of the so-called greenhouse gases, may be altering the thermal properties of our atmosphere. Important social, economic, and scientific questions include the following. Is climate changing? If so, can these changes be related to human activities? Are episodes of extreme weather, such as droughts or hurricanes, increasing in frequency? Long-term meteorological data, on broad spatial and temporal scales, are needed to answer these questions. Unfortunately, such data were never gathered; therefore, indirect proxy methods must be used to infer past climatic trends. A relatively untapped source of paleoclimate data is based on hindcasting past climatic trends using the environmental optima and:tolerances of algae (especially diatoms) preserved in lake sediment profiles. Paleophycologists have used two approaches. Although still controversial, attempts have been made to directly infer climatic variables, such as temperature, from past algal assemblages. The main assumption with these types of analyses is that species composition is either directly related to temperature or that algal assemblages are related to some variable linearly related to temperature. The second more commonly used approach is to infer a limnological variable (e.g. water chemistry, lake ice cover, etc.) that is related to climate. Although paleolimnological approaches are broadly similar across climatic regions, the environmental gradients that paleophycologists track can be very different. For example, climatic inferences in polar regions have focused on past lake ice conditions, whereas in lakes near arctic treeline ecotones, paleophycologists have developed methods to infer past lakewater-dissolved organic carbon, because this variable has been Linked to the density of coniferous trees in a drainage basin. In closed-basin lakes in arid and semiarid regions, past lakewater salinity, which can be robustly reconstructed from fossil algal assemblages, is closely tied to the balance of evaporation and precipitation (i.e. drought frequency). Some recent examples of paleophycolgical work include the documentation of striking environmental changes in high arctic environments in the 19th century believed to be related to climate warming. Meanwhile, diatom-based reconstructions of salinity (e.g. the Great Plains of North America and Africa) have revealed prolonged periods of droughts over the last few millennia that have greatly exceeded those recorded daring recent times. Marked climatic variability that is outside the range captured by the instrumental record has a strong bearing on sustainability of human societies. Only with a long term perspective can we understand natural climatic variability and the potential influences of human activities on climate and thereby increase our ability to understand future climate.

AB  - In the tropics, thermal stratification (during warm conditions) may contribute to a shallowing of the mixed layer above the nutricline and a reduction in the transfer of nutrients to the surface lit-layer, ultimately limiting phytoplankton growth. Using remotely sensed observations and modelled datasets, we study such linkages in the northern Red Sea (NRS) - a typical tropical marine ecosystem. We assess the interannual variability (1998-2015) of both phytoplankton biomass and phenological indices (timing of bloom initiation, duration and termination) in relation to regional warming. We demonstrate that warmer conditions in the NRS are associated with substantially weaker winter phytoplankton blooms, which initiate later, terminate earlier and are shorter in their overall duration (similar to 4 weeks). These alterations are directly linked with the strength of atmospheric forcing (air-sea heat fluxes) and vertical stratification (mixed layer depth [MLD]). The interannual variability of sea surface temperature (SST) is found to be a good indicator of phytoplankton abundance, but appears to be less important for predicting bloom timing. These findings suggest that future climate warming scenarios may have a twofold impact on phytoplankton growth in tropical marine ecosystems: 1) a reduction in phytoplankton abundance and 2) alterations in the timing of seasonal phytoplankton blooms.

AB  - A sediment core from Khatanga-12 Lake (Taimyr Peninsula, Krasnoyarsk krai) has been studied. The 131.5-cm-long core covers ca. 7100 years of sedimentation. Chironomid analysis, a qualitative reconstruction of the paleoenvironment in the region, and a quantitative reconstruction of variations of the mean July air temperature and in the water depth of the lake have been performed using Northern Russia chironomid-inferred mean July temperature models (Nazarova et al., 2008, 2011, 2015). Khatanga-12 Lake was formed during the Middle Holocene warming as a result of thermokarst processes. The development of the lake ecosystem at different stages of its development was influenced by climatic and cryolithogenic factors. The Middle Holocene warming, which occurred around 7100-6250 cal. years BP, activated thermokarst processes and resulted in the formation of the lake basin. Later, between 6250 and 4500 cal. years BP, a period of cooling took place, as is proved by chironomid analysis. The bottom sediments of the lake during this period were formed by erosion processes on the lake shores. The reconstructed conditions were close to the modern after 2500 cal. years BP.

KW  - IMPACTS
AB  - The majority of naturally occurring freshwater on small islands is groundwater, which is primarily recharged by precipitation(1). Recharge rates are therefore likely to be impacted by climate change(2). Freshwater resources on small islands are particularly vulnerable to climate change because they are limited in size and easily compromised(3-5). Here we have compiled available aquifer system characteristics and water-use data for 43 small island developing states distributed worldwide, based on local expert knowledge, publications and regional data sets. Current vulnerability was assessed by evaluating the recharge volume per capita. For future vulnerability, climate change projections were used to estimate changes in aquifer recharge. We find that 44% of islands are in a state of water stress, and while recharge is projected to increase by as much as 117% on 12 islands situated in the western Pacific and Indian Ocean, recharge is projected to decrease by up to 58% on the remaining 31 islands. Of great concern is the lack of enacted groundwater protection legislation for many of the small island developing states identified as highly vulnerable to current and future conditions. Recharge indicators, shown alongside the state of legal groundwater protections, provide a global picture of groundwater supply vulnerability under current and future climate change conditions.

AB  - Rapid urbanization together with policy ineffectiveness in controlling urban growth is often associated to soil and land degradation in both the developing and developed world. The present study analyses the relationship between urban expansion and soil degradation in an arid Mediterranean region (Attica, Greece) where the compact settlement pattern has been replaced by low-density urban development. The study area is one of the most densely populated areas in the Mediterranean basin that has experienced an impressive growth in population during the last 60 yr. Low-density, dispersed urban settlements developed during the last decade (2000-2010) occupy primarily land at medium-low soil quality. However, the overall quality conditions of vegetation, climate and soil assessed by our study shows that urban expansion consumed high-quality land previously classified as non-vulnerable to desertification. By contrast, compact urban settlements have consumed land of intermediate or even high soil quality, but experience poor climatic and vegetation conditions that are classified as highly vulnerable to desertification. Regional planning should incorporate multi-dimensional indicators of soil, climate and vegetation quality to evaluate the environmental impact of urban expansion.

AB  - Cellular nutrient ratios are often applied as indicators of nutrient limitation in phytoplankton studies, especially the so-called Redfield ratio. For periphyton, similar data are scarce. We investigated the changes in cellular C:N:P stoichiometry of benthic microalgae in response to different levels and types of nutrient limitation and a variety of abiotic conditions in laboratory experiments with natural inocula. C:N ratios increased with decreasing growth rate, irrespective of the limiting nutrient. At the highest growth rates, the C:N ratio ranged uniformly around 7.5. N:P ratios <13 indicated N limitation, while N:P ratios > 22 indicated P limitation. Under P limitation, the C:P ratios increased at low growth rate and varied around 130 at highest growth rates. For a medium with balanced supply of N and P, an optimal stoichiometric ratio of C:N:P = 119:17:1 could be deduced for benthic microalgae, which is slightly higher than the Redfield ratio (106:16:1) considered typical for optimally growing phytoplankton. The optimal ratio was stable against changes in abiotic conditions. In conclusion, cellular nutrient ratios are proposed as an indicator for nutrient status in periphyton.

AB  - Irrigated agriculture is a major consumer of limited water resources and also a substantial source of pollution. Use of modem irrigation technologies has been proposed as one of several possible solutions to problems of water resource scarcity and environmental pollution in many irrigated agricultural areas. An economic model to assess irrigation technology choice is developed, which expands many of the aspects developed in previous publications, and takes into consideration aspects such as weather conditions and the dual effects of input quality (soil and water). General relationships between variables are derived and tested for cotton and tomatoes under conditions prevailing on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley, California. The results from the empirical model provide the following main conclusions: (1) modern irrigation technologies serve to substantially reduce impacts of quality and weather differences on profitability; (2) the impacts of changing one input quality indicator are not independent of other input-quality indicators; (3) the categorization of technologies as 'input saving' or 'yield increasing' may be misleading; (4) technology choices are sensitive to product (crop) characteristics, and (5) taxation on pollution increases the likelihood of water conservation, adoption of modern technologies, or transition from one crop to another.

AB  - Advancing toilet technologies to address public health and sanitation issues are a concern of governments and organizations. This article mainly studies the assessment methods for the public toilets and some rural toilets considering from design to demolition to assist for the innovation of toilet technologies. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methods were adopted to identify the assessment indicators and rank the weight. The outcome of Toilet Assessment Scheme (TAS), which includes a set of weightings and a classification system for the selected assessment indicators and sub-indicators. The weight calculation result showed that water resources, ecology, and indoor environmental quality are relatively high, which indicates that saving water, protecting the environment and optimizing the toilet environment should be given priority at the current stage. The individual questionnaire experts from the perspective of gender, profession, and generation, have different emphases on the evaluation scheme. This study can improve the comprehensiveness of toilet evaluation under the distinct background conditions, and will play a relevant role in the promotion of new toilet technology. The TAS can accelerate the toilet revolution in areas where toilets are scarce, and thus will improve the sanitary and health conditions of these populations.

AB  - The permeable pavement has exceptional environmental benefits compared to the traditional hardening pavement. However, few studies have been conducted on the evaluation of the life cycle impacts of permeable pavement. By developing an integrated life cycle evaluation method, this paper aims to comprehensively evaluate the life cycle benefits of permeable pavement from the perspective of both the economic cost and the environmental impact, thus realizing a comprehensive trade-off of impacts of permeable pavement. In the case study, the economic cost and environmental impact of Permeable Asphalt pavement (PA) and Dense-graded Asphalt pavement (DA) with different traffic volumes and structures are compared under the same functional unit and environmental conditions. The results show that PA's high investment in raw material and maintenance makes its economic cost higher than DA, whereas the environmental benefits are considerable. However, the results of the uncertainty analysis indicate that the application of PA still needs caution when the environmental conditions are unstable. This study can act as a supplement to the existing life cycle research of the permeable pavement, and provide theoretical support and reference for its further promotion and application.

AB  - Chronic stress is the main cause of health problems in high-risk jobs. Wearable sensors can become an ecologically valid method of stress level assessment in real-life applications. We sought to determine a non-invasive technique for objective stress monitoring. Data were collected from firefighters during 24-h shifts using sensor belts equipped with a dry-lead electrocardiograph (ECG) and a three-axial accelerometer. Levels of stress experienced during fire incidents were evaluated via a brief self-assessment questionnaire. Types of physical activity were distinguished basing on accelerometer readings, and heart rate variability (HRV) time series were segmented accordingly into corresponding fragments. Those segments were classified as stress/no-stress conditions. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis showed true positive classification as stress condition for 15% of incidents (while maintaining almost zero False Positive Rate), which parallels the amount of truly stressful incidents reported in the questionnaires. These results show a firm correspondence between the perceived stress level and physiological data. Psychophysiological measurements are reliable indicators of stress even in ecological settings and appear promising for chronic stress monitoring in high-risk jobs, such as firefighting.

AB  - Aim. This study was aimed at assessing the possibility of using the Hypogymnia physodes (L.) Nyl. lichen as an accumulative bioindicator of atmospheric air pollution in industrial cities. Methods. Under the conditions of aerial anthropogenic pollution in the city of Kazan, bulk concentrations of such heavy metals (HM) as Pb, Cr, Fe, Cu, Co and Ni were determined in the thalli of epiphytic H. physodes lichen using X-ray fluorescence analysis. Results. According to the data obtained, the samples of lichen thalli contained 0.02 divided by 3.08, 0.68 divided by 2.82, 6.46 divided by 542.99, 6,28 divided by 21,52, 0.01 divided by 0.32 and 0.03 divided by 1.48 mg/kg of lead, chromium, iron, copper, cobalt and nickel, respectively. Conclusion. It is established that the city districts characterized by different environmental conditions showed various HM contents in lichen thalli. On the basis of the elemental composition of the thalli, zoning of the city area was carried out. In addition to instrumental methods, a centile analysis revealed high HM concentrations in the lichen thalli.

AB  - 'Hass' avocado (Persea americana) is a fruit in high demand in international markets, and Colombia is expanding its export to the United States. Avocado quality and shelf life are related to its harvest time. However, there is not enough information on harvest indicators in Colombia that allow producers to adequately harvest fruit to comply with market requirements. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate maturity indicators during two harvest periods. We harvested fruit between the years 2016 and 2017 in eight farms distributed in three regions of the Department of Antioquia, Colombia, and selected those in the postanthesis stages. We assessed variables such as fruit color, weight, dimensions, oil content (OC), and dry matter (DM). The results were analyzed using simple and multiple regressions as well as by principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed a high linear relation between DM and OC (R-2 >= 78.88) and a significant relation between OC, rainfall, fruit development time, and environmental temperature. Nondestructive indicators that allow the establishment of DM in the field (R-2 >= 73.57) varied according to the region and included fruit color (L*, b*), volume (P <= 0.05), and fruit development time. These indicators could reduce maturity heterogeneity during the harvest period.

AB  - Sorted circles and polygons are widespread features of periglacial landscapes, but the controls on their development remain poorly understood, impeding their use as palaeoenvironmental indicators. We investigate the relationship of sorted circles and polygons to altitude in the northern Billefjorden area, central Svalbard. The patterns occur in two distinct elevation zones, below 200-250m asl and above 600m asl. The higher-elevated patterns have smaller diameters and shallower sorting depths due to a thinner active layer at higher elevations, suggesting that sorted patterns can indicate climate conditions and ground thermal state when the patterns initiated. Geology is believed to be of less importance for pattern morphology in the study area, causing only its fine-scale variations. The pattern diameter-to-sorting depth ratios have a median value of 3.57, consistent with previous studies and theoretical models of patterned-ground formation involving circulation mechanisms. Large-scale sorted patterns may develop over centennial timescales in this high-Arctic environment. They are probably not in equilibrium with present-day climate conditions and have probably formed throughout the Holocene. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background: The dense phytoplankton blooms that characterize productive regions and seasons in the oceans are dominated, from high to low latitudes and from coast line to open ocean, by comparatively few, often cosmopolitan species of diatoms. These key dominant species may undergo dramatic changes due to global climate change.
   Results: In order to identify molecular stress-indicators for the ubiquitous diatom species Skeletonema marinoi, we tested stress-related genes in different environmental conditions (i.e. nutrient starvation/depletion, CO2-enrichment and combined effects of these stressors) using RT-qPCR. The data show that these stressors impact algal growth rate, inducing early aging and profound changes in expression levels of the genes of interest.
   Conclusions: Most analyzed genes (e.g. antioxidant-related and aldehyde dehydrogenases) were strongly down-regulated which may indicate a strategy to avoid unnecessary over-investment in their respective proteins. By contrast, key genes were activated (e.g. HSPs, GOX) which may allow the diatom species to better cope with adverse conditions. We propose the use of this panel of genes as early bio-indicators of environmental stress factors in a changing ocean.

AB  - Primate species are characterised by variation in foraging behaviour and dietary composition across their geographic range. Here we examine how ecological conditions account for variation in the behavioural ecology of a widespread arboreal guenon, Cercopithecus mitis. Although substantial variation existed in time budgets, group size, home range and day journey length, clear biogeographic patterns were not apparent. In contrast, dietary variation was correlated with underlying climatic conditions. Temperature seasonality, which tends to increase with latitude, was significantly positively related to the proportion of fruit in the diet and negatively related to the proportion of animal matter. Both dietary components were 'preferred' foods, with the variability between populations reflecting the availability of different food types across their geographic range. Although we found no significant relationships between climate and the proportion of leaves in the diet, the ability for C. mitis to vary its diet to include a diversity of food types, and to incorporate a significant proportion of leaves when preferred sources are scarce, likely underpins its ability to survive across such a large distribution.

AB  - A landscape reconstruction for the late Holocene was carried out in the Land of the Seven Rivers, Kazakhstan, to investigate the environmental conditions during the prehistoric nomadic occupation of the Sakes (similar to 1st mill. BC). Two sampling locations were sedimentologically analysed: a) radiocarbondated late Holocene colluvial deposits and b) fluvial deposits of assumed late Pleistocene to early Holocene age. The geochemical and mineralogical components (ICP element analysis, carbon contents, grain size distributions, X-ray diffractometry) were investigated to identify synsedimentary weathering conditions. A modified weathering index (mCIA) was used to evaluate the weathering processes. The mCIA results were compared with the silt-clay-ratio as an additional indicator for post-depositional soil forming processes. Differences within the silt-clay-ratios and mCIA indexes revealed that during the late Holocene, increased erosion processes occurred in the catchment. A first, tentative geochronology is based on radiocarbon and luminescence ages, ranging from 14.5 +/- 1.4 ka to 3.23 +/- 0.07 cal ka BP for the colluvial deposits. This paleoenvironmental reconstruction is supplemented by a detailed geomorphological characterization of the present landscape (relief, landforms and landscape units) close to the Sakian graves.

AB  - The feasibility to obtain quality agricultural products, irrigated with saline water, makes it necessary to assess areas peripheral to the irrigated oasis in order to determine their suitability for cropping. The goal is to combine diverse methodologies for mapping and assessing ecologically homogeneous units in marginal lands of Mendoza, using plant communities as an indicator of these units. A pilot area was surveyed using LANDSAT/TM image processing, and vegetation, soil and water table were analysed. Assessed vegetation units and their respective salinity ranges (dS m(-1)), up to 50 cm depth, were: steppe of Heterostachys ritteriana, 91-83; shrubland of Allenrolfea vaginata with H. ritteriana, 83-48; open shrubland of A.vaginata con Prosopis strombulifera, 62-55; open steppe of Suaeda divaricata with Atriplex argentina, 52-83; shrubland of S. divaricata con Lycium tenuis-pinosum, 40-43; open woodland of Prosopis flexuosa, 37-26; dense shrubland of Prosopis alpataco, 7-6. The concentration of soluble salts exceeds the critical levels tolerated by cultivated plants. No water tables were detected within 15 m from the surface. It is considered that soils have good drainage conditions, so they can be recovered without high investment. This methodological approach showed good correspondence among plant communities, their spectral expression, and soil salinity and drainage conditions.

AB  - Studies of future management and policy options based on different assumptions provide a mechanism to examine possible Outcomes and especially their likely benefits and consequences. The San Pedro River in Arizona and Sonora, Mexico is an area that has undergone rapid changes in land use and cover, and subsequently is facing keen environmental crises related to water resources. It is the location of a number of studies that have dealt with change analysis, watershed condition, and most recently, alternative futures analysis. The previous work has dealt primarily with resources of habitat, visual quality, and groundwater related to urban development patterns and preferences. In the present study, previously defined future scenarios, in the form of land-use/land-cover grids, were examined relative to their impact on surface-water conditions (e.g., surface runoff and sediment yield). These hydrological outputs were estimated for the baseline year of 2000 and predicted twenty years in the future as a demonstration of how new geographic information system-based hydrologic modeling tools can be used to evaluate the spatial impacts of urban growth patterns on surface-water hydrology.

AB  - In this article we study the compositional variation in a porous cavity having different aspect ratios, accounting for natural convection and for thermal, pressure, and molecular diffusion for a binary mixture. The momentum equation is represented by Darcy's law and is solved numerically together with the energy equation and the species conservation equation using the control-volume scheme. The binary mixture's density and viscosity, as well as molecular, thermal, and pressure diffusion coefficients, vary with temperature, composition, and, pressure. Various thermal boundary conditions are investigated. In the lateral heating case the Soret effect is found to be weak, whereas in the bottom heating condition the Soret effect is more pronounced. Such findings are also evident when both bottom and lateral heating are combined, as ill the third case studied in this article. In the presence of pressure diffusion, the competing effect of the thermal and pressure diffusions objects the compositional variation in the cavity. Darcy number variation also plays all important role in the mixture variation in the cavity, because of the formation of convective cells. It is important to note that the Soret effect is dominant when bottom heating is present and therefore should not be neglected.

AB  - In order to assess the potential radiological risk to humans and the environment from a geological repository for radioactive waste, a safety assessment must be performed. This implies that the release and transfer of radionuclides from the repository into the surface environment are calculated and that the effects in the biosphere are evaluated for an assessment period up to one hundred thousand years according to Swedish regulations. This paper discusses the challenges associated with the modelling of surface ecosystems over such long time scales, using the recently completed assessment for the extension of the existing repository for the low- and intermediate-level nuclear waste (called SFR) in Forsmark, Sweden as an applied example.
   In the assessment, natural variation and uncertainties in climate during the assessment period were captured by using a set of climate cases, primarily reflecting different expectations on the effects of global warming. Development of the landscape at the site, due to post-glacial isostatic rebound, was modelled, and areas where modelling indicated that radionuclides could discharge into the biosphere were identified. Transfers of surface water and groundwater were described with spatially distributed hydrological models. The projected release of radionuclides from the bedrock was then fed into a biosphere radio-nuclide transport model, simulating the transport and fate of radionuclides within and between ecosystems in the landscape. Annual doses for human inhabitants were calculated by combining activity concentrations in environmental media (soil, water, air and plants) with assumptions on habits and land-use of future human inhabitants. Similarly, dose rates to representative organisms of non-human biota were calculated from activity concentrations in relevant habitats, following the ERICA methodology.
   In the main scenario, the calculated risk for humans did not exceed the risk criteria or the screening dose rate for non-human biota, indicating that the repository design is sufficient to protect future populations and the environment. Although the combination of radionuclides, land-uses/habitats, type of most exposed population and area of exposure that contribute most to the total dose shifts over time, the total calculated dose shows limited variability. Significant reductions in the dose only occur during submerged periods and under periglacial climate conditions. As several different water and food pathways were equally important for endpoint results, it is concluded that it would be difficult to represent the biosphere with one or a set of simplified models. Instead, we found that it is important to maintain a diversity of food and water pathways, as key pathways for radionuclide accumulation and exposure partly worked in parallel. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB  - We have studied the relationship between the variations in density of South African anchovy (Engraulisi capensis), sardine (Sardinops sagax) and round herring (Etrumeus whiteheadi) from commercial catch records (1987-1997) and a suite of variables describing the environment. The indicator of density (local fish abundance) used was Catch-perset, obtained from the more than 130 000 catches made during the 11-year study period. The set of environmental parameters included: temporal (Year, Month, time of day or Hour), spatial (Latitude, Longitude and water Depth), lunar (Moon phase and Moon elevation), and thermal conditions of the environment (sea surface temperature together with indices of thermal frontal intensity and temporal change). Boat length was used to account for fishing gear effects. Previous investigations of this nature have tended to use simple bivariate correlation approaches, which suffer from the problem of covariance between the predictive variable and other environmental- or fisheries related variables not included in the analysis. We have, therefore, adopted a multivariate modelling approach, which identifies relationships between Catch-per-set and each environmental variable, accounting for covariation amongst predictors. Model building consisted of first constructing generalised additive models (GAM) as an exploratory tool to identify the shapes of the relationships, followed by parameterising these relationships using general linear models (GLM) to provide a robust predictive tool. Using this modelling approach, the suite of environmental variables explained 19.6% of the variation in Catch-per-set of anchovy, 33.9% of sardine, and 54.3% of round herring in the final GLM models. Temporal variables (Year, Month, Hour), accounted for the major part of the variability in Catch-per-set but variables derived from SST and the lunar cycle provide insight into the effects of environmental factors on fish behaviour. For instance, it appears that schooling behaviour of anchovy and round herring is affected by the level of solar and lunar illumination but that sardine is not affected. Model results further indicate that anchovies prefer water cooler than about 15 degreesC, demonstrates a weak tendency to concentrate near thermal fronts and avoids recently upwelled water. The sardine's preferences seem to be more or less the opposite to anchovy, i.e. it occur further from the coast and tends to concentrate in upwelled water which have been warmed to 14-19 degreesC; it shows no discernible tendency for aggregation near fronts. Round herring Catch-per-set strongly increases with water depth and reach a maximum near the shelf edge; it also demonstrates a notable tendency to concentrate near thermal fronts. SST seems to have no influence on round herring which is most often caught in the 15-18 degreesC range, typical of SSTs found in the vicinity of the oceanic front. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The analysis of the issues encountered by the minor and threatened food plants in Togo includes the spatial distribution as an indicator of the threat's degree. The study was carried out in 280 localities of Togo, on the basis of ethnobotanic investigations. The study covered the five ecological zones and various socio-ethnical groups. Local names, botanical and culinary descriptions, photos and samples of the plants were used to define or identify cultivated or spontaneous (wild) species. For species identification, we used usual keys and nomenclature published. However, naming and classification have been adjusted to the classification of APG III and The Plant List (2010). As a result, 137 food plant species were inventoried as minor or threatened. The minor plants identified are traditional varieties adapted to local environmental conditions, selected and cultivated by farmers. They are said to be minor compared to plants grown abundantly and widely distributed, consumed throughout the world. The 137 species were classified into four categories as follows: (1) wild food species that are minor, (2) wild food species that are not minor, but endangered, (3) food species and varieties cultivated that are minor and (4) food varieties and species cultivated that are not minor, but endangered. The plants studied include 87 spontaneous species belonging to 45 families and 50 cultivated species in one or several varieties belonging to 22 families. The crops are divided into 28 species of which only one variety per species is endangered and 22 species in which 2 to 18 varieties are threatened per species. Regarding the nature of minor and threatened food plant organs consumed, tuber and root varieties are the most numerous, followed by seed varieties, then by fruit and grain varieties. However, considering the number of species, the fruit species are dominant. Local leaf, stem or rhizome varieties are poorly represented among the cultivated plants. This shows that both wild species (mostly fruit) and those cultivated and daily consumed suffer erosion, constituting a threat to food security for local populations. The large fraction of wild fruit and endangered vegetables is a worry because of their use in food recipes by western African populations during food crisis periods. The number of plants varies from 2 to 40 according to the localities. However, this number varies between 10 and 50 for the majority of the ethnical groups. The analysis of plant spatial distribution shows that 20% of the plants are in regression on all the extent of Togo. On the other hand, 10%, 18% and 18% of the plants carry respectively northern, central and southern limited distributions. The other plants present interregional distributions. These various distributions indicate different threat's degrees that depend not only on the number of indicated plants, but also on the natural distribution of the species.

AB  - The development of researches of the chemical composition of surface waters (rivers, lakes, reservoirs and ponds) is due to problems that are solved at one stage or an- other in the development of the country's economy and are related to water quality issues. Depending on the tasks set during hydrochemical researches, attention is paid to a particular group of chemical components in water 1) the main ions and their total amount (water mineralization); 2) dissolved gases; 3) biogenic elements; 4) organic matter, 5) microelements (including heavy metals); 6) radioactive elements; 7) specific pollutants. The article presents an analytical review of studies of the chemical composition of surface waters of Ukraine from the beginning of systematic research in the first half of the 20th century to the present day (1920-2020). The authors identified four typical chronological periods in the history of hydrochemical studies of surface waters in Ukraine. I period (1920s-1950s)- the beginning of systematic hydrochemical studies of surface waters; the appearance of regular observations of the chemical composition of water at the posts of hydrometeorological service on the Dnipro and Southern Bug rivers (1930s) and publication of these data in "Hydrological Yearbooks"; hydrochemical studies for selected large projects (Dnipro hydroelectric power station). II period (1950s-1970s) - expansion of hydrochemical research to meet the needs of water and hydropower construction, forecasting their possible impact on the country's water resources; increasing the number of observation points for the chemical composition of water on large and medium-sized rivers; development of hydrochemistry of reservoirs. III period (1970s - at the beginning of the 2000s)- development of complex hydrochemical researches in the conditions of increasing anthropogenic load on water objects; creation of a system of hydrochemical monitoring of water bodies within the framework of the national system of observation and control of the environment (1973); application of sanitary and hygienic criteria for assessment of water quality - universal maximum acceptable concentrations (MAC); publication of quarterly "Hydrochemical Bulletins" (since 1967); development of radioecological studies of natural waters after the Chernobyl accident (1986); first publication in Ukraine of textbooks on hydrochemistry. IV period (after the beginning of the 2000s) - reformatting of hydrochemical research (monitoring system) to the requirements of the Water Framework Directive of the European Union, especially after the signing of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement in 2014; reforming the water monitoring system based on environmental rationing with the identification of reference indicators; components of state monitoring of surface waters are the monitoring of biological, hydromorphological, chemical and physico-chemical parameters. The article also describes scientific hydrochemical schools: Institute of Hydrobiology of NAS of Ukraine; Tams Shevchenko National University of Kyiv; Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Institute of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine and NAS of Ukraine.

AB  - Recent benthic foraminifers from the Oyambre estuary (north of Spain) have been studied in order to learn their biological response to drastic anthropic environmental changes that this estuary has undergone within the last centuries. Up to 41 species have been identified and 24 of them showed live specimens during the sampling period. The most abundant species are Ammonia tepida, Balticammina pseudomacrescens, Cribroelphidium williamsorti, Enezia macrescens, Haynesina germanica, Cibicidoides lobatulus, Miliammina fusca and Trochammina inflata. The statistical analysis (cluster and correspondence analysis) has allowed the differentiation of four groups of samples that are characterized by three assemblages that define the following environments: sandy outer estuary with marine influence (C. lobatulus), mid and inner estuary that comprises an euryhaline subtidal environment with silty sediment (A. tepida and H. germanica), intertidal channels with the lowest salinity levels (C. willicunsoni), and marshes (B. pseudomacrescens, E. macrescens, M. fusca and T. inflata).
   The great number of species with agglutinated shells reveals the ongoing draining in mud-flat areas, as well as the establishment of the vegetated high marsh, where the invasive exotic plant Baccharis halimifolia is removing the reed bed ecosystem and filling, blocking and reducing main and secondary channels. As a result, there is hardly any sandy low marsh left, which in other nearby estuaries of Cantabria is delimited by the species M. fusca. Thus, areas with tidal levels between MHWNT (Mean High Water Neap Tide) and MHW (Mean High Waters) are scarce. However, foraminifer species that live in the high marsh above MHW are dominant. Entzia macrescens and T. inflata mark the interval between MHW and MHWST (Mean High Water Spring Tide), while B. pseudomacrescens the one from MHSWST to the barren zone (vegetated high marshes, closest to land).
   A comparison between the biocoenosis and thanatocoenosis assemblages generally shows a good similarity (Sanders' index > 60%). The few samples with a low similarity reveal the effect of post-mortem processes, specially decantation, and, to a lesser extent, suspended transport, which once again points to the lack of hydrodynarnism in the estuary. The percentage of exotic or allochthonous species that are deposited in this estuary is very low (the average ranges from 13.4% in the mouth to 0.7% in the inner area), which reveals that the Oyambre estuary has a mesotidal character in its mouth, while in the mid and inner area it can be considered a microtidal estuary. All these data expose that the works conducted in order to recover the Oyambre estuary between years 2009 and 2010 seem not to have been successful in restoring the marshes to their original hydrodynamic conditions.

AB  - Pockmarks are circular-shaped depressions that increase seabed heterogeneity and are characterized by discontinuous fluid emissions. To understand how environmental conditions of pockmarks affect the structure of macroand meiofauna, we investigated two sites in a pockmark field in the northwestern Madagascar margin. In a comparative approach, we explored the community structure of the dominant taxa (Polychaeta, Nematoda and hyaline foraminifera) in each component (macro-, metazoan meiofauna and foraminifera, respectively). The investigated active pockmark showed approximately two times higher meiofauna abundance compared to in a site away from another pockmark field, but macrofauna showed the opposite trend, with almost half density at the pockmark site. However, at both sites, macroand meiofauna showed higher richness and abundance values in the top well-oxygenated layers of the sediment than in the underlaying ones. Polychaeta and Nematoda showed lower richness in the pockmark, opposed to hyaline foraminiferans, but lower evenness in the pockmark was found for the three groups. The detection of gas flares in the water column attests of the recent activity within the pockmark. High amount of sulfur-bearing minerals (mainly pyrite) evidences a production of dissolved free sulfides (not detected at the time of sampling) by sulfate reduction process driven by organic matter degradation and anaerobic oxidation of methane. Furthermore, recent increase in sedimentation rates in the past 70 years and organic matter inputs could have led to higher organic matter degradation rates resulting in reduced conditions and a high oxygen consumption. All this together seem to act as key factors in the determination of variation in richness, abundance and community composition of macrofauna and meiofauna. Additionally, some taxa seem to be more tolerant to these extreme conditions, such as species belonging to the Nematoda genus Desmodora and the phylum Kinorhyncha, which are highly abundant in the pockmark, and hence, may be considered as potential bioindicators of pockmark activity in this area. Further studies are required for a better assessment.

AB  - Pyriteous mudrocks of the pyritic deposit situated at 28 km of Douala (pK28) were studied in a tropical forest setting of Douala Sub-basin (Cameroon, Central Africa), using physicochemical analyses, X-ray diffraction and ICP-AES and ICP-MS in order to decipher source rock weathering, provenance, paleo-redox conditions and tectonic setting. Three main types of sediments were differentiated in the area that include mudstones (claystones and siltstones), sandstones (fine sandstones and coarse sandstones) and lenses of conglomerates. All the pyriteous mudstones fades of the study area contain between 88.15 and 98.45 wt% (clay and silt fractions). Siltstones and claystones containing pyrite are more acid and more acid and relatively homogenous, and have organic carbon content higher than the sandstone facies and red laminated mudstone. All these mudrocks are essentially Fe-shales. Mineralogically, they are essentially composed of quartz, kaolinite, smectite, goethite, hematite, K-feldspar and pyrite. The CIA is more than 98% and Th/U ratios are higher than 4. This shows that these mudrocks have been derived from significantly weathered source rock. The Al2O3/TiO2 ratios between 12.19 and 21.69, Cr/Th and Th/Cr ratios respectively 4.59-48.46 and 0.02-0.22, La/Th versus Th/Yb, a negative Eu anomaly and higher LREE/HREE ratios showed that they were mostly composed of felsic rocks with lesser contribution of mafic rocks like source rocks of Bomkoul, Missole, Kumba and Delta of Niger mudstones. The U/Th ratios below 1.25, V/Cr ratios less than 2 and Ce anomaly ranged from 1 to 1.12 are indicators that investigated mudrocks were deposited in an oxic fully marine environment in the area of active continental margin field like those of Bomkoul, Missole, Kumba mudrocks and Delta of Niger mudstones.

AB  - The main goal of this study is to understand the patterns in which commercial buildings consume energy, rather than evaluating building energy use based on aggregate utility bills typically linked to building principal tenant activity or occupancy type. The energy consumption patterns define buildings as externally-load, internally-load, or mixed-load dominated buildings. Penn State and Harvard campuses serve as case studies for this particular research project. The buildings in these two campuses use steam, chilled water, and electricity as energy commodities and maintain databases of different resolutions to include minute, hourly, daily, and monthly data instances depending on the commodity and available data acquisition system. The results of this study show monthly steam consumption directly correlates to outdoor environmental conditions for 88% of the studied buildings, while chilled water consumption has negligible correlation to the outdoor environmental conditions. Thus, in terms of monthly chilled water consumption, 86% of buildings are internally-load and mixed-load dominated, respectively. Chilled water consumption is better suited for the daily analyses compared to the monthly and hourly analyses. While the influence of building operation schedules affects the analyses at the hourly level, the monthly chilled water consumptions are not good indicators of the building energy consumption patterns. Electricity consumption at the monthly (or seasonal) level can support the building energy simulation tools for the building energy retrofits. A granular electricity data, e.g. interval hourly or 15-min, could reveal building operation schedules. Overall, the steam consumption for these campus buildings located in the Northeastern United States indicated a stronger correlation to the outdoor conditions than the operation schedules. The energy consumption patterns for the reviewed campus buildings suggest opportunities for the campuses to benefit from a better: (i) interactions of the steam generation/distribution systems with the building heating demand, (ii) chilled water data collection systems to optimize the cooling demand and operation schedule of the buildings, and (iii) electricity consumption with relying on daylighting and variable operation schedules during summer and winter seasons.

AB  - Experimental and field evidence from sediments collected at an upper bathyal site in the outer Oslofjord, Norway, show that the benthic foraminifer Nonionella iridea lives closely associated with a steep oxygen concentration gradient in the surface sediment (0-2 cm). An experiment was designed to investigate the effect of organic matter enrichment, physical disturbance simulating bioturbation, and the resultant oxygen conditions on benthic foraminifera <75 mu m in size. At the beginning of the experiment, all individuals were <75 pm, at the end of the eight week experiment the >90 mu m fraction was analysed. In the experiment, N. iridea was found most abundantly in oxic conditions but also grew under suboxic-hypoxic conditions. It has previously been reported to be an indicator of the arrival of phytodetritus to the seafloor. In this study N. iridea showed maximum abundance where no food was added, it probably fed on degrading organic matter and associated microbes. Weekly physical disturbance of the surface (0-2 cm) sediments caused a lower abundance of N. iridea by >50% and created a significantly lower abundance in the overall foraminiferal assemblage compared to when the sediment was undisturbed. The disturbance probably has a negative impact because it disrupts biogeochemical gradients (e.g., rapid variation of oxygen concentration and gradients) and associated food within the sediment (e.g., patches of fresh food increasing microbial degradation and oxygen consumption). Both field and experimental data suggest that Brizalina skagerrakensis proliferates after the arrival of fresh phytodetritus in well oxygenated sediments. Based on microhabitat distributions, associated dissolved oxygen concentrations and previous reports, we hypothesise that B. skagerrakensis, N. iridea and Stainforthia fusiformis, in the order mentioned, show a successive ability to proliferate in habitats along a gradient from dominantly fresh to dominantly more refractory organic material and associated microbes related to organic matter degradation and the quality and quantity of organic matter.

AB  - Shale detachment zones, their influence on deformational style, and their internal mechanisms of deformation are an understudied aspect of fold-thrust belts. Properties such as deformational temperature, lithology, and mineralogy are often recognized as having a key influence on the rheology and deformational style of detachment zones and overlying fold-thrust belts. However, little work has been conducted on rock properties of known detachment zones. A recently described upper-level detachment zone in the exhumed Khao Khwang Fold-Thrust Belt of central Thailand provides an ideal natural laboratory for investigation of the deformation conditions of the detachment zone, and association with its complex deformational style. The low-grade metamorphic indicator illite aystallinty is used to broadly constrain deformational temperatures, while oxygen and carbon stable isotope analysis provides insight into fluid flow history and fluid-rock interaction. Illite crystallinity data indicate deep diagenetic, to low anchizonal conditions, and temperatures of similar to 160-210 degrees C in the shale detachment, interpreted as reflecting peak metamorphic conditions during the Triassic Indosinian Orogeny. No trend between the intensity (spacing, complexity) of structures and illite crystallinty is observed. However, shale shear zones of continuous-style deformation and inferred higher finite strain display uniformly higher illite crystallinty than surrounding packages of discontinuously faulted shales. We also note a positive association between total organic carbon content in the shales and the spacing and complexity of deformational structures. Data from limestones and syn-tectonic vein fills detail the history of fluid-rock interaction during early mesogenesis, through to orogenesis. The early covariant trend of increasingly negative delta C-13 and delta O-18 values is attributed to increasing burial, while a divergent orogenic trend of increasingly negative delta O-18 values is interpreted as the result of a loss of matrix permeability and interruption of fluid-rock re-equilibration. These hottest fluids were concentrated along large thrusts which facilitated fluid movement during orogenesis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paleoenvironments of late Pleistocene and early Holocene time on the Southern High Plains have been studied for decades, but regionally extensive or long-term, easily recoverable proxy climate indicators are difficult to find. The stratigraphy of valley fill and upland eolian deposits and stable-carbon isotope data, in addition to geographically limited paleontological data, now provide clues to the environment during this time, which includes the earliest, or Paleoindian period (similar to 11,200-8000 C-14 yr B.P.) of human occupation. During the Clovis occupation (similar to 11,200-10,900 C-14 yr B.P.), valleys contained perennial streams. This was followed in Folsom time (10,900-10,200 C-14 yr B.P.) by an abrupt change to lakes and ponds (with water levels fluctuating between several meters depth and no surface water) and marshes and accumulation of sheet sands on uplands, starting the earliest phase of construction of the regional dune fields. These changing conditions indicate a shift from relatively wetter to relatively drier conditions with episodic drought. Stable-C isotopes further indicate that warming characterized the Clovis-Folsom transition. During the rest of the Paleoindian period the environment was relatively cool but fluctuated between wetter and drier conditions with an overall trend toward drying that resulted in further enlargement of the dune fields and culminated in the warm, dry Altithermal beginning similar to 8000 C-14 yr B.P. Clovis time probably was the wettest of any Paleoindian period in terms of runoff and spring discharge. The Folsom period was drier and was the earliest episode of regional wind erosion and eolian deposition and may have been the warmest of Paleoindian times. Evidence of a previously hypothesized "Clovis drought" in this region is sparse. (C) 2000 University of Washington.

AB  - The macrophytes in running waters are good bioindicators for using either water or sediment-water interactions. The bioindication is realized at the species level by stenoecic species in relation to the factor considered (mineralisation and trophy), or at the level of phytocenoses. Several conditions have to be met to obtain bioindication scales which are quantified and reproducible. These are the a) hydrological sampling, b) definition of the water qualities, c) existence of a complete range of variations of these qualities, d) integration of rheological, sedimentological and morphometric facies in the Vegetation sampling.
   Condition a) is met in the alluvial alsatian floodplain of the Rhine, which is characterized by highly mineralized, calcic bicarbonated waters and the large plateau of triassic sandstone of the Northern Vosges with poorly mineralized waters. These two sectors will be used as model for our demonstration.
   Saproby and trophy will be distinguished. Moreover the trophic quality need be separated from the mineral content (bicarbonate, calcium) and is defined by the phosphate and ammonia nitrogen (as toxic factor) levels, nitrate being, exceptionally, a limiting factor.
   The vegetation surveys are realized globally, i.e. by integrating the rheological facies in river reaches of many hundred meters to obtain the minimal area. Laboratory controls (analyses of leaf, sediment and water, ammonia toxicity and phosphorus uptake experiments) will supplement the field observations and surveys. The establishment of a bioindication scale of the trophic level lead us to discuss on concepts of aquatic ecology of running oligosaprobic waters. In the hierarchisation of the factors responsible for the vegetation distribution, water mineralisation constitutes the highest level, followed by the trophy (phosphate and ammonia), then by the rheological, sedimentological and morphometric parameters.
   Hydrological applications and new knowledge of the ecological spectrum of hydrophytes are mentioned. For Instance, we use the bioindication method of river-groundwater exchange in an alluvial floodplain, and the memory of hydrological events (flood). Thus, the aquatic macrophyte communities are used as ecological describers of spatio-temporal variations of the trophic quality.

AB  - Spatiotemporal complexities increase the uncertainty of the results of various desertification assessment models. We integrated the Mediterranean desertification and land-use (MEDALUS) model with Bayesian networks (BNs) to develop a novel method for desertification assessment in central Iran. We first derived the current desertification status of the study area from empirical observations of actual, current desertification conditions and mapped the obtained status based on the criteria of the MEDALUS model. We then utilized BNs to produce three separate causal models for the soil, groundwater, and wind erosion indicators of the MEDALUS model. We then integrated all the related indicators and indices into a desertification assessment BNs model. After the reevaluation and sensitivity analysis of the model, we compared its results with those of the MEDALUS model. The obtained results highlighted soil condition and wind erosion as the main determinants of desertification in the study area. Considering the ability of BNs to accommodate uncertainty in the assessment process, these models can assist relevant authorities in making informed decisions. They can also be applied as decision support tools for adaptive management in fragile ecosystems of arid areas.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of progressive decline during which there is progressive dependence on family members and the health care system. The first step in the treatment is to make a diagnosis and communicate it to patients and families. The many things that should be done for optimal management must be started early. In the majority of patients enhancement of cholinergic function can produce a plateau for a period of time or at least can reduce the speed of decline. Comprehensive and appropriate treatment plans that meet all patients' needs can only be developed as a result of thorough assessment of the patient, the family, and the home environment. The assessment should address the patient's medical condition, including functional status, cognitive status, other medical conditions and non cognitive symptoms of AD. The assessment should also address the caregiver's needs and risks. Physicians should solicit and consider their input in post-diagnostic treatment planning. Comprehensive reassessment should occur every 6 months or more frequently with any sudden decline or be havioral change. The primary care practitioner should provide information and education about current level of disease and should talk with the patient and family to establish treatment goals.

AB  - Classically, biologists have considered adaptation of behavioural characteristics in terms of long-term functional benefits to the individual, such as survival or reproductive fitness. in captive species, including the domestic horse, this level of explanation is limited, as for the most part, horses are housed in conditions that differ markedly from those in which they evolved. In addition, an individual horse's reproductive fitness is largely determined by man rather than its own behavioural strategies. Perhaps for reasons of this kind, explanations of behavioural adaptation to environmental challenges by domestic animals, including the capacity to learn new responses to these challenges, tend to concentrate on the proximate causes of behaviour. However, understanding the original function of these adaptive responses can help us explain why animals perform apparently novel or functionless activities in certain housing conditions and may help us to appreciate what the animal welfare implications might be. This paper reviews the behavioural adaptation of the domestic horse to captivity and discusses how apparently abnormal behaviour may not only provide a useful practical indicator of specific environmental deficiencies but may also serve the animal as an adaptive response to these deficiencies in an "abnormal" environment.

AB  - Decisions involving chemical process design, including selection of technologies and operating conditions, should integrate environmental considerations. The assessment methodology presented in this article includes nine environmental and human health impact indices, a "level I" multimedia fate and transport model, and an air emissions estimation calculator based on emission factors and correlations. The methodology and software tool was used to evaluate two case studies involving mixed-solvent recovery from a gaseous waste stream utilizing output from a commercial process simulator. The assessment methodology was applied for two evaluations: (a) separation technology selection and (b) choice of process operating conditions. It was found that two adsorption technologies with either steam stripping or vacuum regeneration are superior to three absorption technology configurations based on environmental and health indices. With suitable weightings, a single process composite index was defined and served as an environmental objective function for the evaluation of absorber oil flow rate changes using a single absorption technology configuration. It was found that the process composite index exhibited a reduction in environmental impact of 94% when operated at the "environmental impact minimum" absorber oil flow rate, compared to releasing the VOCs directly to the environment.

AB  - This study presents the diversity and structure of pelagic zooplankton in north-eastern Poland. The research was conducted in 47 lakes with different trophic conditions in the middle of summer. Samples were collected close to the deepest part of the lakes to avoid the diverse benthic and littoral zones. We found 119 zooplankton species of which 32 were Cladocera, 16 were Cyclopoida, 4 were Calanoida, and 67 were Rotifera. We determined which species occurred most frequently in the region, as well as the species that were characteristic of different trophic conditions. We also recorded the presence of eight cold-adapted species which some of them are considered as glacial relicts (e.g., Eurytemora lacustris, Heterocope appendiculata, Cyclops lacustris). Our research revealed potential glacial refugia for planktonic species in 14 lakes of NE Poland. Our study suggests that the presence of stenotherm species may be an excellent indicator of the ecological status of deep lakes and could be considered in lake monitoring programs. Furthermore, we did not find Bythotrephes longimanus which has been reported from Poland. Instead, we found that B. brevimanus was the most common representative of the genus in the study area.

AB  - The study of fine particles (PM2.5) and its relationship with health has not been much explored in Brazil. Only with Resolution CONAMA 491/2018 that PM(2.5)was nationally considered a pollutant of interest, while the World Health Organization brings guidelines for its environmental concentration since 2006. PM(2.5)monitoring in Brazil is still restricted to few Southeast municipalities. From Brazilian time series epidemiological studies that studied PM(2.5)and its relationship with health, mainly due to respiratory causes, air quality modeling was mostly employed. This paper aims to survey epidemiological studies already carried out for PM(2.5)in Brazil, discussing the use of monitored and modeled data for this purpose. The use of relative risks to estimate excess mortality and morbidity is also evidenced as a direct measure to quantify the benefits associated with air quality improvement, and an estimate for Brazilian municipalities is performed. Finally, the importance of well-designed emission control strategies is emphasized so that the health benefits of improving air quality are indeed significant.

AB  - Storage is crucial to the sequence of food management. It is nonetheless at times difficult to recognize in the archaeological record due to problems of preservation of ancient food remains. Archaeoentomology in this sense can be of great value as it sheds light on past storage techniques. This study presents the findings of the archaeoentomological analyses carried out at the ancient granary of La Fortaleza (Gran Canaria, Spain, ca. 600-1450 AD), a site where the favorable conditions of preservation allow recording the food plants and insect pests associated with storage. Moreover, the recovery of several taxa of primary and secondary pests connected to different stages of store infestation (i.e. Sitophilus granarius (L.), Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.), Tenebrioides mauritanicus (L.), Mezium americanum (Laporte de Castelnau), Stegobium paniceum (L.) and Cryptolestes sp.) offers data as to the storage conditions and time intervals of the Prehispanic Canarian indigenous population. Finally, new radiocarbon-datings of the pests yield data casting light on the origin and spread of several cosmopolitan taxa such as M. americanum and on past relations between Africa, Europe and the New World.

AB  - In order to evaluate the environmental status within a mariculture pond, temporal variations of physico-chemical factors, protist community structure and interactions between biota and environmental conditions were investigated during a complete cycle in semi-enclosed shrimp-farming waters near Qingdao, north China. Results revealed that: (1) a total Of 54 protist taxa with ten dominant species was present, comprising 4 chlorophyceans, 2 chrysophyceans, 5 cryptophyceans, 10 dinoflagellates, 3 euglenophyceans, 10 diatoms, 18 ciliates and 2 sarcodines, (2) a single peak of protist abundance occurred in October, mainly due to the chlorophyceans, diatoms and chrysophyceans, while the bimodal peaks of biomass in July and October were mainly due to the ciliates, dinoflagellates and diatoms; (3) the succession of protist communities significantly correlated with the changes of nutrients, salinity and temperature, especially phosphate, either alone or in combination with NO3; (4) species diversity and evenness indices were found to be relatively independent of physico-chemical factors, whereas species richness and the ratio of biomass to abundance were strongly correlated with water temperature and abundances of bacteria. It was concluded that planktonic protists are potentially useful bioindicators Of water quality in a semi-enclosed mariculture system.

AB  - Risk assessment and minimisation of environmental hazards are critical issues to consider in the geotechnical engineering projects. A case of highway pavement seepage induced by groundwater, at a locality along the section of Hua-Qing Highway of Guangdong Province, China, is presented for environmental hazard analysis and effective remediation. The environmental hazard analyses were based on in situ hydrogeologic investigation, rock-soil testing and integrated environmental understanding. The analyses indicate that the highway seepage was caused by elevation of groundwater hydraulic pressure in low permeable strata near the highway pavement, which was controlled by landform, hydrology, weather and road structure. The risk source of groundwater 'flooding' was the groundwater and surface water in the ring-like valley around Fenshui Village. A blind-ditch system for effective remediation of the pavement seepage hazard was proposed and successfully implemented by declining groundwater table near the highway based on the comprehensive assessment of various conditions. This geotechnical accident shows that the role of groundwater is an essential factor to consider in the geotechnical and environmental engineering studies and multidisciplinary effort for risk assessment of environmental hazards is important under current global climate change condition.

AB  - The use of biological indicators (131) to monitor the effectiveness of sterilisation is described, amongst other places, in the European Pharmacopoeia. (Reference) sterilisation parameters are also specified for three methods: for sterilisation using moist and dry heat and for sterilisation by irradiation. These parameters ensure adequate and safe sterilisation, with observance of a sterility assurance level (SAL) of 10(-6) and below. This means that routine use of biological indicators to monitor the effectiveness of sterilisation is not necessary in these cases. Routine use of biological indicators is only mandatory in the case of gaseous sterilisation.
   Knowledge of the D-value of the biological indicator is useful for determining the adequate gas exposure time. However, the certified D-value is only valid under defined sterilisation conditions which are often different from those in routine sterilisation. In the latter case, the D-value must be re-determined under routine sterilisation conditions. The European standard, EN 866, specifies how the D-value(s) is/ are to be determined in such cases. These normative requirements are difficult to implement in practice. In such cases, a "combination" of practical considerations and normative requirements should be used to identify solutions in individual cases.

AB  - In an effort to predict the source rock lithology from oil biomarkers in the Akita Basin, the relationship of diacholestane abundance to clay mineral content, thermal maturation, and the oxic/anoxic depositional conditions of representative mudstone samples has been investigated. The relative diacholestane abundance of samples with similar maturity levels increases with increasing clay mineral content. The oxic/anoxic depositional conditions of the samples, estimated by C-35-homohopane index, are less influential for diacholestane formation in the case of the Yabase oil field samples. A crossplot of the diacholestane abundance versus ethylcholestanes 20S/(20S + 20R) and clay mineral content was applied to evaluate the source rock lithology of the Yabase oils. The source of this oil is consequently predicted to be the clay-poor siliceous rocks of the Miocene Onnagawa Formation. Although this study did not achieve quantitative clay content prediction, the results demonstrate that this approach is useful for the characterization of source rock lithology, especially for moderately mature oils.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate contrasting organic amendments as a strategy to promote the recovery of biotic and abiotic edaphic conditions central to the reestablishment of soil ecosystem functions at a site in south-central Chile affected by megafires in the 2016-2017 summer season. We analyzed the effects of the application of fresh (poultry and swine manure) and stabilized (compost of agricultural waste origin) organic amendments on microbial parameters, including basal respiration, microbial biomass, the carbon mineralization coefficient, and the microbial metabolic quotient, along with soil physicochemical properties related to soil fertility and stability. All organic amendments improved soil fertility and stimulated soil microbial activity. Fresh amendments, particularly swine manure, promoted the immediate recovery of the microbial conditions evaluated. However, greater mineralization rates and thus presumably shorter periods of carbon (C) source consumption were related to the application of such organic amendments. Soils treated with compost accumulated the most organic carbon and nitrogen, ensuring long-term nutrient release and thus long-term soil function recovery. Choosing the type of organic amendment to use to sustain ecosystem resilience will highly depend on the restoration goals over time.

AB  - Endophytes are novel sources of natural bioactive compounds. This study seeks endophytes that produce the anticancer enzyme L-asparaginase, to harness their potential for mass production. Four plants with anticancer properties; Cymbopogon citratus, Murraya koenigii, Oldenlandia diffusa and Pereskia bleo, were selected as host plants. L-Asparaginase-producing endophytes were detected by the formation of pink zones on agar, a result of hydrolyzes of asparagine into aspartic acid and ammonia that converts the phenol red dye indicator from yellow (acidic condition) to pink (alkaline condition). The anticancer enzyme asparaginase was further quantified via Nesslerization. Results revealed that a total of 89 morphotypes were isolated; mostly from P. bleo (40), followed by O. diffusa (25), C. citratus (14) and M. koenigii (10). Only 25 of these morphotypes produced L-asparaginase, mostly from P. bleo and their asparaginase activities were between 0.0069 and 0.025 mu M mL(-1) min(-1). L-Asparaginase producing isolates were identified as probable species of the genus Colletotrichum, Fusarium, Phoma and Penicillium. Studies here revealed that endophytes are good alternative sources for L-asparaginase production and they can be sourced from anticancer plants, particularly P. bleo.

AB  - The barnacle, Chelonibia testudinaria, is an obligate commensal of sea turtles that may show population variability according to the physical characteristics of the environment and properties of turtle hosts; therefore, we characterized the distributional patterns and the potential effects on health of C. testudinaria on juvenile green turtles in Bahia Magdalena, Mexico. Barnacle attachment position, abundance, and size-class structure were described, while the relationship between barnacle abundance and turtle health condition and size was explored through generalized linear models. Juvenile green turtles of Bahia Magdalena offered an appropriate habitat for C. testudinaria as their frequency of occurrence was high and their abundance was similar to that found in other green turtle populations. Barnacles showed an aggregated distribution that may be facilitating their reproduction during the warm summer months. Barnacle abundance is unaffected by turtle size or seasonality, while their attachment position appears to be influenced by water flow over the turtle carapace and by plastron abrasion by the turtle against the sea floor. Healthier turtles exhibited a decreased barnacle load; therefore we suggest that C. testudinaria abundance may be a useful indicator of health for juvenile green turtles.

AB  - Housing is an important aspect of living standards and quality of life for older persons, but the housing-related problems they may face encompass rather different circumstances, relating to the condition of the dwelling, how well equipped it is, whether housing costs represent a serious burden, and whether the neighbourhood environment is problematic. This paper brings out the importance of distinguishing these different dimensions of housing problems for older people, illustrated empirically using data for Ireland from an important new European dataset. Controlling for other factors, being older is associated with more housing quality problems but fewer housing cost and neighbourhood problems than for those of working age. The variables predicting deprivation among older people differ across the dimensions and the correlations between the dimensions are low. Over half the older people in the sample experience some form of housing-related deprivation, but a majority of these are reporting only one. Scores on a summary index for older persons are much less strongly associated with factors such as household income and poverty, marital status, and location and type of dwelling than for all households, bringing out the importance of distinguishing and studying the different dimensions and framing appropriate policy responses to each.

AB  - Concentration ratios (CRs), expressed by dividing Cs-137 activity in seawater by that in marine biota (mainly fish), were obtained from the monitoring of Cs-137 in coastal areas around Japan between 1984 and 2016. Before the TEPCO Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident (1984-2010), mean CRs of Cs-137, mainly from global fallout (i.e. CRGF), were almost constant for each species throughout the monitoring period, but were different among species, while the values for several species were dependent on their length (i.e. CRGF-SIZE). Thus, CRGF and CRGF-SIZE values for 29 of marketable species are given here as references for conditions where marine biota are in approximate equilibrium (or steady state) with their host water with respect to Cs-137 activities in the marine environment. After the FDNPP accident (2011-2016), the impact of the accident has been sustained in eastern Japan waters as indicated by apparent CRs (CR(a)s) which are being used here as indicators of disequilibrium between organisms and their host water. The recession rates of this disequilibrium (the effective CRa half-lives) ranged from 100 to 1100 days. The identified distinct variation was due to the sample locations, even for the same species, because of the change in Cs-137 activity concentrations in their host water and diet preference differences. Variation among species, even those captured from the same area, was mainly due to diet differences as well as metabolic-physiological differences in Cs-137 retention. Thus, our results from >30 years of systematically monitoring have helped quantify the recession rates of post-FDNPP disequilibrium of Cs-137 in biota for assessment of how long term is required from contaminated condition by underlying spatial, inter- and intra-species factors.

AB  - Weaning is a source of social, nutritional and environmental disorders that challenge piglet health. This study assesses the relevance of using plasma indicators of oxidative status as biomarkers of health around weaning in pigs. Blood antioxidant potential (BAP), hydroperoxides (HPO), oxidative stress index (OSI, e.g. HPO/BAP), vitamin A and E concentrations were investigated in two different trials. Trial A was carried out in an experimental unit to investigate the effects of age (from 12 to 147 days of age), weaning (at 21 or 28 days of age) and management at weaning (in optimal (OC) or deteriorated (DC) conditions) on those parameters. Trial B was performed in 16 commercial pig farms to describe the variability of these indicators on field between 26 and 75 days of age. In trial A, between 12 and 147 days of age, HPO globally increased (P < 0.001), vitamin E concentration decreased (P < 0.001) whereas BAP and vitamin A concentration remained relatively stable (P > 0.1). Vitamins E and A concentrations dropped 5 days after weaning independently of weaning age, weaning conditions and expression of diarrhea (P < 0.001). Twelve days after weaning, whatever the weaning age, HPO and OSI increased in DC compared to OC piglets (P = 0.05 and P < 0.01) and in piglets exhibiting diarrhea compared to those without diarrhea (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001). In DC pigs, BAP was also decreased (P < 0.05) 12 days after weaning. On trial B, plasma concentrations of vitamins A and E decreased and HPO increased 5 and 19 days respectively after weaning (P < 0,001). Contrarily to trial A, BAP values did not drop after weaning. Piglets which had the lowest ADG (Average Daily Gain) after weaning had greater HPO and OSI and lower vitamin A and E concentrations after weaning but also lower vitamin E concentration before weaning (P < 0.05). In conclusion, HPO or OSI seem to be good indicators of health disorders around weaning and plasma concentration of vitamin E before weaning is associated to growth after weaning.

AB  - Flow regulation is widely known to modify the thermal regime of rivers. Here, we examine the sensitivity of an empirical approach, the Equilibrium Temperature Concept (ETC), to detect both the effects of hydraulic infrastructures on the annual thermal cycle and the recovery of the thermal equilibrium with the atmosphere. Analysis was undertaken in a Pyrenean river (the Noguera Pallaresa, Ebro basin) affected by a series of reservoirs and hydropower plants. Equilibrium temperature (T-e) is defined as the water temperature (T-w) at which the sum of all heat fluxes is zero. Based on the assumption of a linear relationship between T-e and T-w, we identified changes in the T-e-T-w regression slope, used as an indicator of a thermal alteration in river flow. We also assessed the magnitude of the alteration by examining the regression slope and its statistical significance. Variations in the regression parameters were used as indicators of the influence of factors other than atmospheric conditions on water temperature. Observed T-w showed a linear relationship with T-e at all river stations. However, the slopes of the T-e-T-w relationship appeared to be lower in the reaches downstream from hydraulic infrastructures, particularly below large dams. A seasonal analysis indicated that T-e-T-w relationships had higher slopes and lower p-values during autumn, while no significant differences were found at other seasons. Although thermal characteristics did not strongly depend on atmospheric conditions downstream of hydraulic infrastructures, the river recovered to pre-alteration conditions with distance downstream, indicating the natural tendency of water to attain thermal equilibrium with the atmosphere. Accepting associated uncertainties, mostly because of the quality of the data and the lack of consideration of other factors influencing the thermal regime (e.g. discharge), ETC appears to be a simple and effective method to identify thermal alterations in regulated rivers.

AB  - Although pedogenic barite has been documented in many modern soils and palaeosols, no actualistic studies on its formation have been reported. Because barite is stable over the entire range of pressure and temperature of the Earth's crust, it preserves reliable data about the original environment in which it formed. Pedogenic barite and barite-bearing soils have been used as indicators of landscape stability, environmental conditions, climate and microbial acti-vity. This study compares field data, micromorphology and stable isotope geochemistry of a barite-bearing palaeosol from the Morrison Formation (Jurassic) and a modern analogue soil in south-central Texas, USA. Morrison barite-bearing palaeosols are over-thickened cumulic palaeosols that developed in subaerially exposed lacustrine sediments during an extended lake contraction event. Lateral facies relationships document changes in hydrology and duration of episaturated conditions (perched water table above the Btg horizons) that correspond to differences in barite nodule morphology and abundance. Barite precipitation occurred at a redox boundary higher on the landscape after organic matter was completely oxidized. Sulphur isotope data indicate that the initial source of sulphur was soil organic matter. Meteoric water is the likely source of oxygen for the sulphate. Barium sourced from weathering feldspars and clays. The modern analogue displays similar catenary relationships, redox features and micromorphological characteristics compared to the Morrison palaeosols, suggesting that similar pedogenic processes led to barite precipitation. Synthesized data suggest that conditions favourable to barite-bearing soil formation are low-gradient basins that have received feldspar-rich sediments (i.e. volcanically influenced basins), soils that developed near salt domes, soils that developed in exposed wetland or lacustrine sediments and coastal plain deposits. When studied in a well-documented palaeogeographic context, barite-bearing soils are valuable to palaeoclimate, palaeoenvironmental and palaeohydrological studies. Combined with regional interfluve palaeosols, barite-bearing palaeosols may document temporal changes in drainage, surface stability, and accommodation consistent with sequence boundaries/maximum flooding surfaces and climate changes.

AB  - Water stress and nitrogen (N) availability are the main constraints on barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.) yield in Mediterranean conditions. Here we studied the combined effects of N source and water regime (WR) on plant growth, photosynthesis and carbon isotope discrimination (Delta(13)C) in barley grown under controlled conditions. The effects of these conditions on plant N isotope discrimination against the fertiliser (Delta(15)N) was also examined to assess whether the natural variation in plant N isotope composition is a reliable indicator of N nutrition. Six experimental treatments were established with three nutrient solutions containing ammonium ( NH(4)(+p)), nitrate (NO(3)(-)) or a mixture of the two (NH(4)(+) : NO(3)(-)), each either well watered or moderately water stressed. The NH(4)(+) : NO(3)(-) treatment resulted in the greatest biomass accumulation and photosynthetic capacity in both WRs. The NH(4)(+) plants showed accelerated phenology and depressed growth. They also had the lowest photosynthetic rates in both WRs. This effect was mainly due to stomatal closure, while electron transport and carboxylation capacity of leaves were less affected. Consistent with lower stomatal conductance, leaf Delta(13)C was lower in plants that received NH(4)(+), indicating higher water use efficiency (WUE) not only when irrigated, but also under water stress. In addition, leaf Delta(13)C and photosynthetic N use efficiency (PNUE) correlated positively with each other and with shoot biomass in both WRs. However, NO(3)(-) treatment produced the greatest Delta(15)N, which was higher in leaves than in roots. Leaf Delta(15)N was decreased by water stress only in plants in the NO(3)(-) treatment. We conclude that leaf Delta(13)C is an adequate trait to assess the differences in growth, photosynthetic activity and WUE caused by distinct N sources. However, the usefulness of natural abundance of (15)N in plant tissue as a nitrogen source marker is restricted by the effect of WR and internal plant fractionation, at least for plants that received NO(3)(-).

AB  - Caves in tropical regions form a key resource for those reconstructing human evolution and dispersals. However, the complex sedimentary records they contain remain under-interpreted because of the poorly constrained effects of humid tropical climates upon archaeological site formation processes. Guano-driven phosphatic diagenesis impacts archaeological preservation in caves, but atypical features observed in guano layers in prominent Southeast Asian archaeological sites suggested that hot and humid conditions had promoted the formation of distinctive sedimentary environments with unknown effects on assemblage taphonomy. Few reference data exist that are relevant to geomorphic processes in tropical caves and this laboratory-based modern analogue study was designed to conclusively relate analytical observations to sedimentary palaeoenvironments and explore their effects on assemblage taphonomy. Stratigraphic models were kept under simulated tropical conditions, each containing an identical range of faunal remains, organic materials and minerals, which was buried in wet bat guano. These were excavated, one per month over 24 months, while nine further stratigraphic models were used to control for environmental variables. Sedimentary environments were investigated using sedimentological characterisations of excavated sediments, while post-depositional alterations to buried materials were investigated through optical and scanning electron microscopic analysis of thin-section samples combined with chemical characterisations of excavated samples through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Experimental conditions prevented the sediment acidification that is typically associated with guanodriven diagenesis, but buried materials were severely, and distinctively, diagenetically altered. Organic decomposition in guano, bamboo and charcoal was associated with the activities of sulphate-reducing bacteria, but diagenetic alterations affecting charcoal remain poorly resolved due to variation in the experimental assemblage. Bone was discoloured and affected by dissolution, recrystallisation and alteration to secondary minerals, including gypsum, while carbonates reprecipitated as calcium phosphates and non-stochiometric mineral species. Diagenesis of clay minerals was observed, but related diagenetic trajectories remain poorly resolved. These alterations provide micromorphological and mineralogical indicators of sedimentary palaeoenvironments in the earliest stages of burial and this experiment provides a framework within which to understand the taphonomy of archaeological materials in tropical caves.

AB  - Field and laboratory studies were carried out with the aim of characterizing the depositional environment and oxidation conditions during accumulation of shales in the Mamfe basin. Field studies denoted that the shales were black to dark grey in color, sub-tabular to tabular in occurrence, with some (n = 20) reacting vigorously with dilute HCl, while others did not (n = 5). Due to the carbonate content of the samples both whole rock dissolution and partial dissolution, using dilute acetic acid to target the carbonate fraction in the samples, were employed. The seven shale-rich units investigated have average whole rock Ni/Co, V/Cr, U/Th and Th/U ratios of 1.68-2.0, 1.13-2.95, 0.24-0.51 and > 2, respectively. PAAS normalized rare earth elements in the whole rock samples display an enrichment of light rare earth elements (LREEs) over heavy rare earth elements (HREEs), middle rare earth elements (MREEs) over HREEs, positive Gd, Eu anomalies, no Ce anomalies, and an average Y/Ho ratio of 29.7 ppm. The carbonate fraction of the samples displays two different REE pattern types. Sites 1 and 6 have typical hat-shaped patterns with extensive MREE enrichment. The other locations are slightly HREE depleted and have weak MREE enrichment with negative Y anomalies. The trace element ratios and the REE patterns of the whole rock and carbonate fractions indicate that the sediments deposited in the Mamfe basin accumulated in non-marine environments. Furthermore, their coloration, MREE enrichment and lack of Ce anomalies in the carbonate fractions infers that the depositional area was in a vegetated, low-land lacustrine setting with limited oxygenation of the sediment, whereas the negative Ce anomalies in the whole rock shale samples is probably due to particulate scavenging of REEs from the fluid during transport. This would require the water to be deficient in Ce and, thus reflect oxidizing conditions in the source area and along the transport system.

AB  - High densities of white-tailed deer restrict the regeneration of tree species, reduce understory cover and diversity, enhance invasions of exotic species, and facilitate the spread of human and deer diseases. Deer managers often base management decisions on estimated deer densities and carrying capacities, generating controversy. It may be simpler, cheaper, and more appropriate to manage deer populations in relation to their effects on local habitat conditions. Here, we describe a method based on the mean ages of woody twigs on saplings exposed to browsing. Growth can be traced back at least five years on deciduous species using terminal bud scale scars, generating estimates for the minimum interval between browsing events. We applied this method to three species of maple (Acer) growing in canopy gaps in- and outside a 5-7 year-old fenced deer exclosure in a mature forest in upper Michigan. Maples are palatable to deer but resprout readily after browsing. The method was simple and efficient to implement in the field with negligible among-observer variation. Mean twig age responded sensitively to differences in deer impacts among species, across the fence, and over time (all p < 0.002). Acer rubrum and pensylvanicum had lower mean twig ages than A. saccharum reflecting higher rates of browsing. Twig age showed a larger deer effect size and r(2) values than the sapling height or browse indicators (Cohen's d = 34.85 vs. 1.39 and 9.55 for height and browse; r(2) = 0.556 vs. 0.154 and 0.331). Twig ages declined with height outside the fence while rising inside, providing a second independent indicator of deer impacts. Twig ages provide a direct indicator of deer browse on regenerating trees with lower sampling variance and higher independence from local environmental conditions than height or browse incidence. We should next test the twig age method in other contexts and species to confirm that it is an efficient, sensitive, and reliable indicator of deer impacts and habitat conditions.

AB  - Biomarker analyses for evaluating maturity of organic matter and depositional environments such as redox conditions, were performed in sediments across the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary (CTB) in the Saku Formation of the Yezo Group distributed along the Shumarinai-gawa River and the Omagari-zawa River, both in the Tomamae area, Hokkaido, Japan. Maturity indicators using steranes and hopanes, show that organic matter in sediments from the Shumarinai-gawa and Omagari-zawa sections are of lower maturity than those from the Hakkin-gawa section (Oyubari area). Moreover, the beta beta hopane ratios clearly show that the maturity of the Shumarinai-gawa samples is lower than that of the Omagarizawa samples. These variations in the maturity of organic matter presumably reflect the difference in their burial histories. The results for the pristane/phytane (Pr/Ph) ratios suggest that the Shumarinai-gawa samples were deposited under dysoxic to anoxic environments across the CTB, while the depositional environments of the Omagari-zawa samples were relatively oxic. By another paleoredox indicator using C-35 homohopanoids including a homohopene index (HHenI), higher values are observed in the Shumarinai-gawa section, particularly in the horizons of the preceding period and an early stage of the first negative shift phase and the latest oceanic anoxic event 2 (OAE2) interval. These results suggest that the Shumarinai-gawa samples record dysoxic to anoxic environments across the CTB. In contrast, the signals for the C35 homohopanoid index values show a relatively oxic condition in the Omagari-zawa section. The trends of stratigraphic variations in redox conditions are different from those in the OAE2 interval in the proto-Atlantic and Tethys regions as reported previously. Hence, the redox variations in the Tomamae area were basically related to a local environmental setting rather than global anoxia. However, the prominent anoxic emphasis observed in the HHenI profile of the Shumarinai-gawa section can be a distinctive, and possibly global, event in the North-West Pacific just before the OAE2.

AB  - Purpose To examine eye tracking data and compare visual behavior in individuals with normal hearing (NH) and with moderate hearing loss (HL) during two types of driving conditions: normal driving and driving while performing a secondary task.
   Methods 24 participants with HL and 24 with NH were exposed to normal driving and to driving with a secondary task (observation and recall of 4 visually displayed letters). Eye movement behavior was assessed during normal driving by the following performance indicators: number of glances away from the road; mean duration of glances away from the road; maximum duration of glances away from the road; and percentage of time looking at the road. During driving with the secondary task, eye movement data were assessed in terms of number of glances to the secondary task display, mean duration of glances to the secondary task display, and maximum duration of glances to the secondary task display. The secondary task performance was assessed as well, counting the number of correct letters, the number of skipped letters, and the number of correct letters ignoring order.
   Results While driving with the secondary task, drivers with HL looked twice as often in the rear-view mirror than during normal driving and twice as often as drivers with NH regardless of condition. During secondary task, the HL group looked away from the road more frequently but for shorter durations than the NH group. Drivers with HL had fewer correct letters and more skipped letters than drivers with NH.
   Conclusions Differences in visual behavior between drivers with NH and with HL are bound to the driving condition. Driving with a secondary task, drivers with HL spend as much time looking away from the road as drivers with NH, however with more frequent and shorter glances away. Secondary task performance is lower for the HL group, suggesting this group is less willing to perform this task. The results also indicate that drivers with HL use fewer but more focused glances away than drivers with NH, they also perform a visual scan of the surrounding traffic environment before looking away towards the secondary task display.

AB  - Various studies have been reported on the bioeffects of magnetic field exposure; however, no consensus or guideline is available for experimental designs relating to exposure conditions as yet. In this study, logistic regression (LR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used in order to analyze and predict the melatonin excretion patterns in the rat exposed to extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF). Subsequently, on a database containing 33 experiments, performances of LR and ANNs were compared through resubstitution and jackknife tests. Predictor variables were more effective parameters and included frequency, polarization, exposure duration, and strength of magnetic fields. Also, five performance measures including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and normalized percentage, better than random (S) were used to evaluate the performance of models. The LR as a conventional model obtained poor prediction performance. Nonetheless, LR distinguished the duration of magnetic fields as a statistically significant parameter. Also, horizontal polarization of magnetic fields with the highest logit coefficient (or parameter estimate) with negative sign was found to be the strongest indicator for experimental designs relating to exposure conditions. This means that each experiment with horizontal polarization of magnetic fields has a higher probability to result in "not changed melatonin level" pattern. On the other hand, ANNs, a more powerful model which has not been introduced in predicting melatonin excretion patterns in the rat exposed to ELF-MF, showed high performance measure values and higher reliability, especially obtaining 0.55 value of MCC through jackknife tests. Obtained results showed that Such predictor models are promising and may play a useful role in defining guidelines for experimental designs relating to exposure conditions. In conclusion, analysis of the bioelectromagnetic data could result in finding a relationship between electromagnetic fields and different biological processes. Bioelectromagnetics 31:164-171, 2010.

AB  - Sinorhizobium meliloti associates with Medicago and Melilotus species to develop nitrogen-fixing symbioses. The agricultural relevance of these associations, the worldwide distribution of acid soils, and the remarkable acid sensitivity of the microsymbiont have all stimulated research on the responses of the symbionts to acid environments. We show here that an adaptive acid-tolerance response (ATR) can be induced in S. meliloti, as shown previously for Sinorhizobium medicae, when the bacteria are grown in batch cultures at the slightly acid pH of 6.1. In marked contrast, no increased tolerance to hydrogen ions is obtained if rhizobia are grown in a chemostat under continuous cultivation at the same pH. The adaptive ATR appears as a complex process triggered by an increased hydrogen-ion concentration, but operative only if other - as yet unknown - concomitant factors that depend on the culture conditions are present (although not provided under continuous cultivation). Although the stability of the ATR and its influence on acid tolerance has been characterized in rhizobia, no data have been available on the effect of the adapted state on symbiosis. Coinoculation experiments showed that acid-adapted indicator rhizobia (ATR+) were present in > 90% of the nodules when nodulation was performed at pH 5.6, representing a > 30% increase in occupancy compared with a control test. We show that the ATR represents a clear advantage in competing for nodulation at low pH. It is not yet clear whether such an effect results from an improved performance in the acid environment during preinfection, an enhanced ability to initiate infections, or both conditions. The practical use of ATR+ rhizobia will depend on validation experiments with soil microcosms and on field testing, as well as on the possibility of preserving the physiology of ATR+ bacteria in inoculant formulations.

AB  - Intrinsic tensile stress, which can lead to problems in deposited thin films such as cracking, peeling, and delamination, often develops during the early stages of thin film growth. Many attempts have been made to estimate the tensile stress during crystallite coalescence, both experimentally and analytically. Most recently, using a combination of Hertzian contact mechanics and elasticity theory, Freund and Chason applied the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) theory to account for adhesion between crystallites under specific conditions. Other existing contact mechanics models that naturally account for adhesion include the improved Derjaguin-Muller-Toporotov and Maugis-Dugdale theories. The objective of this study is to provide useful analytical and numerical techniques based on these contact mechanics theories for a wide range of conditions that accurately approximate the intrinsic tensile stress that develops during crystallite coalescence. As an analytical method, the Maugis-Dugdale model is proposed as a more general alternative to the JKR model. Parameters such as the contact radius and "net" adhesive force are computed as a function of the relative separation between two adjacent crystallites in a thin gold film. Another useful parameter known as the "jump-to-contact" separation is also calculated by the Maugis-Dugdale and JKR models. For comparison to the analytical models, a finite element method is used to simulate the crystallite coalescence problem. The numerical technique is based on a nonlinear surface interaction element developed to approximate van der Waals adhesion, and allows for full-field analysis of stress and displacement in crystallites. Two different boundary conditions are used, for which corresponding contact radius and tensile stress are computed and compared to the analytical results. As a further study, the length scale effect is also investigated by varying the radius of individual crystallites from 20 nm to 300 nm. It is concluded that in order to estimate the average tensile stress accurately using analytical models, the radius of individual crystallites must be large compared to the contact radius. For small length scales, the finite element approach is more appropriate. (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.

KW  - PHOSPHATE SOLUBILIZATION
AB  - Penicillium radicum is a phosphate-solubilising fungus with plant growth promoting (PGP) activity. The widespread agronomic use of P. radicum as an inoculant is dependent on the accurate prediction of conditions where PGP response will occur. Therefore, the effect of soil physicochemical and biotic factors on PGP of wheat by P. radicum was investigated. In the first experiment, PGP was assayed in 10 soils with differing physicochemical properties. Each soil was tested with and without treatment with hydroxyapatite-an insoluble form of calcium phosphate used to increase the level of total inorganic P available for microbial solubilisation. Inoculation of wheat with P. radicum significantly (P < 0.05) increased plant growth in 4 of the 10 soils tested. The magnitude of the PGP response varied with soil type, and ranged from 8.5% ( plant height, Avon soil) to 75% ( plant weight, Mingenew soil). Most soil properties had little influence on PGP, with only low soil fertility ( N and/or P) identified as a strong indicator of PGP by P. radicum. When detected, PGP was strongest in acidic soil conditions, although PGP was observed in neutral and alkaline soils. Virtually no interactions were detected between addition of hydroxyapatite to the soil and P. radicum inoculation. The second experiment tested PGP in 3 soils previously found to be nonresponsive to inoculation, before and after sterilisation by &gamma;-irradiation. Soil biological factors affected PGP by P. radicum in 2 of the 3 soils tested. In these soils, removal of biological factor(s) increased (P < 0.05 and P < 0.1) PGP by P. radicum. These experiments have shown that large and significant increases in plant growth promotion can be achieved through seed inoculation with P. radicum. However, both abiotic and biotic soil properties play a critical role in determining the success of inoculation. P. radicum-stimulated PGP occurred in infertile soils, with a stronger effect in acidic soil conditions. Furthermore, soil biological factors can have an important role in regulating PGP by P. radicum.

AB  - The toxicity of cadmium and zinc at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10000 mug/l to the life-span of decaudised cercarial bodies (cercariae that have shed their tails) of Diplostomum spathaceum was investigated. The effects of metal exposure at 3 temperatures (12, 20, and 25 degreesC) and 3 levels of water hardness (distilled water, soft water and hard water) were studied. In general, under most experimental conditions increasing metal concentrations reduced the life-span of decaudised cercariae. Increasing water hardness and decreasing water temperature caused an increase in the life-span of both control and metal exposed decaudised cercariae. However, at certain isolated metal concentrations, associated with a specific level of water hardness and temperature, increased survival above controls occurred. Differences in the relative toxicity of cadmium and zinc were dependent on the environmental conditions of exposure. The decaudised cercarial life-span under metal exposure was found to be generally independent of the overall cercarial survival and tail loss in most experimental conditions. Prolonged exposure to cadmium and zinc caused changes in the decaudised cercarial life-span when compared to individuals decaudised during the initial 24 h exposure period to those which were decaudised during the final 24 h period of cercarial survival. The validity of studying the decaudised cercarial life-span as an indicator of 'fitness' of larvae to migrate through the tissues of the target fish host, in terms of glycogen utilization, was assessed for those cercariae decaudised during the initial 24 h exposure period only. A limited reduction in the decaudised cercarial life-span during this period compared to controls was recorded, which may possibly indicate a reduced penetration 'fitness' of cercariae exposed to cadmium and zinc. The importance and relevance of these findings to parasite migration and establishment in the fish host are discussed.

AB  - The Molasse basin, constituting the western part of the Paratethys, formed as a consequence or the Alpine orogeny during the Tertiary. To address the influence of the Alpine upliftment and associated geographic changes on the regional climate, the faunal assemblages and geochemistry of Miocene marine and brackish ostracods of the Molasse sediments were investigated. Eighteen sites from the Bavarian Molasse to the Vienna basin were studied. ranging in age from the Eggenburgian to the Pannonian: (20 to 8.5 Ma). A total of 176 species of 71 genera were found, with the highest species diversity observed for Loxoconcha (12), Aurila (11), Cyprideis (9), and Cytheridea (7). On the basis of the different genera, the bathymetry of sedimentation can be characterized as infra- to circalittoral. From the Eggenburgian to the Early Sarmatian (20 to 13 Ma) open marine conditions are indicated by the faunal assemblages. For the Late Sarmatian and Pannonian (12 to 8.5 Ma), the occurrence of Cyprideis spp. and candonid species indicate brackish conditions. Chemical and isotopic analyses concentrated an valves of Cytheridea spp, and Cyprideis spp., but valves from other ostracod species were also analyzed to evaluate the effects of the environment of formation and vital effects. For the period from 20 to 13 Ma, the Sr isotope ratios (Sr-87/Sr-86 between 0.70850 and 0.70883) and delta O-18 values (range from 28.3 parts per thousand to 32.8 parts per thousand, VSMOW) are compatible with open marine conditions. Nd isotope ratios for this period are quite different for different localities (between 0.51216-0.51225), indicating localized control on seawater Nd-143/Nd-144 ratios. Mean delta C-13 values for this period range from -5.2 parts per thousand to +1.4 parts per thousand (VPDB), Sr/Ca ratios from 0.0039 to 0.0067, and Mg/Ca ratios from 0.0083 to 0.0287, For the period from 12 to 8.5 Ma the variations in Sr-87/Sr-86 (0.70872-0.70883), delta O-18 (24.1 parts per thousand to 30.2 parts per thousand) and delta C-13 values (-7.8 parts per thousand to -2.6 parts per thousand), as well as Sr/Ca (0.0021 to 0.0059), and Mg/Ca (0.0116 to 0.0284) all increase. For this period the Nd isotope compositions are quite homogeneous (0.51218-0.51220), indicating a similar source lithological control on hydrochemistry which may allow the Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios to be interpreted in terms of changes in water temperature and mineralogy of the precipitating phases. Geochemical changes for this period are compatible with alternating influences of seawater and brackish conditions as well as changes resulting from evaporation. For all periods delta O-18 and delta C-13 values as well as Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca of different species from the same samples generally have similar trends with small offsets. By comparison to records of climatic change from the global oceans, the delta O-18 values for marine fossils of the Molasse between 20 and 13 Ma are interpreted to reflect global changes in climate. This is also true for the increasingly brackish conditions up to 11 Ma, where combined geochemical records are still compatible with the global changes in temperatures. However, increasing complexity of the brackish system makes detailed comparisons with global changes difficult, particularly after 9.5 Ma (Late Pannonian stages D/E). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In recent years, there has been considerable growth in the provision of and demand for adventure tourism; however, research that examines the resources regarding adventure tourism is limited. A spatial suitability evaluation system for mountain-based adventure tourism (MBAT) was developed via the integration of the AHP-Delphi technique. The evaluation system parameters included resource conditions, difficulty levels, safety conditions, and ecological sensitivity. Furthermore, each parameter contained several indicators that can be quantified and visualised in ArcGIS. The results showed that suitable areas for professional adventure tourism in Xinjiang Tianshan include the Kurdening and Tomur regions, and the those for adventure tourism include the Tianshan Tianchi lake. Furthermore, suitable areas for experiential adventure tourism include the Tianshan Tianchi lake, Tianshan Grand Canyon, Jiangbulak, East Tianshan, Tuohurasu scenic area, and the Gongliu wild fruit forest, while those for mass adventure tourism include large areas in the middle and low altitude range of Tianshan. The methods and results proposed in this paper are expected to be significant for planning adventure tourism and can be helpful for mountain communities when choosing regions to develop for adventure tourism, formulating tourism development strategies, increasing tourism opportunities, and thus improving regional competitiveness.

AB  - This work aims to formulate scientifically based criteria for assessing the quality of acacia monofloral honey. Honey sampling, analysis of organoleptic and physicochemical parameters were carried out according to DSTU 4497:2005 "Natural honey. Technical conditions". The identification of pollen grains of honey plants was carried out according to the atlas of pollen grains. We analyzed 50 acacia honey samples that came to the laboratory from different regions of Ukraine. We found that the content of dominant pollen from acacia ranged from 5 to 25%. In terms of pollen analysis, ten acacia honey samples belong to monofloral honey. We showed that the average value of proline in acacia honey ranged from 130 mg/kg to 195 +/- 53.9 mg/kg, electrical conductivity from 0.1 +/- 0.01 mS/cm to 0.2 +/- 04 mS/cm, the ratio of fructose to glucose should be at least 1.4. The necessity is justified concerning making changes to DSTU 4497:2005 "Natural honey. Technical conditions" and harmonization with international requirements for indicators of proline concentration and electrical conductivity in honey from acacia bee. The following criteria are proposed for assessing acacia monofloral honey quality: specific composition of pollen grains, proline content, conductivity indicators, and the ratio of fructose to glucose.

AB  - Lactic acid bacteria have been used since ancient times for food preparation and for bio-conservation by fermentation. Selected strains are capable of producing antimicrobial peptides - bacteriocins, which can be natural preservatives, especially in products with short shelf lives. The present study is focused on inhibitory effects of the bacteriocin-producing bacteria strains Enterococcus faecium, Pediococccus acidilactici and Lactobacillus plantarum against Listeria innocua as an indicator microorganism. Freeze-dried preparations of bacterial strains producing particular bacteriocins were tested by agar well-diffusion assay and by the traditional spread plate method. Plantaricin exhibited the highest anti-listerial effect among the tested bacteriocins. Pediocin also demonstrated a distinct inhibitory effect, but enterocin appeared to be heat labile and its efficiency was also suppressed under cold storage conditions. Plantaricin reduced Listeria innocua counts by 1 log in dairy spread made from cheese and quark. The formation of bacteriocins by various Lactobacillus plantarum strains were substantially influenced by the cultivation conditions of the mother culture and by the microbial preparation process before freeze-drying. Bacteriocins introduced into foodstuffs via protective cultures in situ offer new perspectives on enhancing food quality and safety.

AB  - Microclimatic conditions of tropical forest favour the high richness of bryophytes, which by being sensitive to environmental changes, are important indicators of habitat conditions. The aim of this study was to determine the richness and species composition of the bryophyte flora in fragments of terra firme forest on the great curve of the Xingu River, Para state, Brazil. The collections were made in August and September 2012 in 14 fragments, in which were installed two plots per fragment, one at the edge and one inside, measuring 10 x 10 m each. The results showed 77 species in 45 genera and 18 families. Lejeunea setiloba Spruce and Marchesinia brachiata (Sw.) Schiffn. are new records for Para state. The richness families in this study were the ones typically found in tropical forest surveys. A high richness of rare species in comparison to common ones, a pattern usually observed for plants in tropical forests was not reported in this study, probably due to historical fragmentation and disturbance in the area. The richness and species composition were determined mainly by the physiognomic characteristics of the studied forest fragments.

AB  - This article presents a palynological study carried out on a sediment core from a peat deposit in Serra de Botucatu, in Sao Paulo State, southeastern Brazilian Plateau. This region has been covered by grassland vegetation and forest patches throughout the recorded period. AMS radiocarbon dating plus palynological analysis of 27 samples from the sediment core allowed the recognition of several environmental changes that took place during the last 33,000 yr recorded in the core. The relationship between sedimentation rates and changes in the abundance of plants recognized through their pollen record, particularly a few important indicator species, provided the paleoenvironmental history for the Serra de Botucatu region, allowing the identification of changes in climate conditions and comparison with other regions in Brazil. One of the most remarkable features of this record is the cold and humid conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum, which diverges from previous interpretations for southeastern and southern Brazil but is in good agreement with paleoclimatic data from trace elements from cave stalagmites in SE Brazil. No indications of human impacts on the vegetation were found in this record.

AB  - Vibration analysis of unstiffened/stiffened plates has long been studied due to its importance in the design and condition assessments of ship and offshore structures. Corrosion is inevitable in steel structures and has been so far considered in strength analysis of structures. We studied the free vibration of pitted corroded plates with simply supported boundary conditions. Finite element analysis, with ABAQUS, was used to determine the natural frequencies and mode shapes of corroded plates. Influential parameters including plate aspect ratio, degree of pit, one-sided/both-sided corroded plate, and different corrosion patterns were investigated. By increasing the degree of corrosion, reduction of natural frequency increases. Plate aspect ratio and plate dimensions have no influence on reduction of natural frequency. Different corrosion patterns on the surface of one-sided corroded plates have little influence on reduction of natural frequency. Ratio of pit depth over plate thickness has no influence on the reduction of natural frequency. The reduction of natural frequency in both-sided corroded plates is higher than one-sided corroded plates with the same amount of total corrosion loss. Mode shapes of vibration would change due to corrosion, except square mode shapes.

AB  - To date, relatively few studies have tried to determine the practicality of using physiological information to help answer complex ecological questions and assist in conservation actions aimed at improving conditions for fish populations. In this study, the physiological stress responses of fish were evaluated in-stream between agricultural and forested stream reaches to determine whether differences in these responses can be used as tools to evaluate conservation actions. Creek chub Semotilus atromaculatus sampled directly from forested and agricultural stream segments did not show differences in a suite of physiological indicators. When given a thermal challenge in the laboratory, creek chub sampled from cooler forested stream reaches had higher cortisol levels and higher metabolic stress responses to thermal challenge than creek chub collected from warmer and more thermally variable agricultural reaches within the same stream. Despite fish from agricultural and forested stream segments having different primary and secondary stress responses, fish were able to maintain homeostasis of other physiological indicators to thermal challenge. These results demonstrate that local habitat conditions within discrete stream reaches may impact the stress responses of resident fish and provide insight into changes in community structure and the ability of tolerant fish species to persist in agricultural areas.

AB  - Modification of forest attributes and structural components like downed wood (DW) during forest harvest can lead to local species loss. Epixylic bryophytes have been proposed as good indicators of such changes. Unharvested control, variable canopy retention, and single pass harvest represent a gradient in forest harvest impact and can be used to test the response of epixylic bryophytes to different levels of environmental change. The objective of this study was to see if variable canopy retention attenuates environmental change associated with harvesting, consequently maintaining an epixylic community more similar to unharvested stands than single pass harvesting. Environmental conditions and DW characteristics were sampled on 225 DW pieces distributed in 45 permanent plots. Results showed that treatment affected epixylic richness through its impact on canopy openness and DW diameter and decomposition class. Fewer species were found in more open habitats and more species were found on bigger and more decomposed DW. Most epixylic species were more commonly found on the forest floor than on the DW. In conclusion, variable canopy retention harvest offered microclimatic conditions and DW availability and quality more suitable for epixylic species than single pass harvest, which was less suitable for epixylic species.

AB  - The application of bioluminescent sensors for monitoring key metabolites and enzymes that are indicators of stress in plants is demonstrated. The sensitivity of bioluminescent assay for NAD(P)H and NAD(P)(+) was about 0.5 and 1 nmol, respectively. The levels of NAD(P)H and NAD(P)(+) in radish (Raphanus sativus) root extracts from controls and from stress-induced conditions were compared. To induce environmental stress, the plants were grown in enclosed environmental chambers with low pressure (9 or 32 kPa), high humidity (>80%) and low oxygen partial pressure (down to 3.3-6.5 kPa). The concentrations of NAD(P)(+) and NAD(P)H in plants varied under stress conditions. Decreasing both total pressure from 101.5 to 32 or 9 kPa and partial pressure of oxygen increased the ratio of NAD(P)(+)/NAD(P)H from 0.2 to 4 or 6, respectively. The increase in this ratio suggests that plants are undergoing stress in these hypobaric environments. The developed bioluminescent assay for quantification of pyridine nucleotides in plant tissues is rapid, low-cost and easily performed. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Feather pecking in laying hens is a major welfare and production problem for commercial egg producers, resulting in mortality, loss of production as well as welfare issues for the damaged birds. Damaging outbreaks of feather pecking are currently impossible to control, despite a number of proposed interventions. However, the ability to predict feather damage in advance would be a valuable research tool for identifying which management or environmental factors could be the most effective interventions at different ages. This paper proposes a framework for forecasting the damage caused by injurious pecking based on automated image processing and statistical analysis. By frame-by-frame analysis of video recordings of laying hen flocks, optical flow measures are calculated as indicators of the movement of the birds. From the optical flow datasets, measures of disturbance are extracted using hidden Markov models. Based on these disturbance measures and age-related variables, the levels of feather damage in flocks in future weeks is predicted. Applying the proposed method to real-world datasets, it is shown that the disturbance measures offer improved predictive values for feather damage thus enabling an identification of flocks with probable prevalence of damage and injury later in lay.

AB  - For many years, rangeland monitoring has mainly been the field of scientists, academics and extension workers trying to fine-tune methods to assess the condition of rangelands. Frameworks and monitoring systems developed with their associated indicators are often complex and inaccessible to land users who lack the advanced equipment to implement them, and the relevant training to analyse and interpret monitoring results. After reviewing the challenges and opportunities in rangeland monitoring, this paper describes the local-level monitoring (LLM) conceptual tool, which is flexible, adaptive and easy to use by local land users for monitoring and documenting changes in natural resources and livestock conditions in order to guide and support management responses accordingly. As a concept, the LLM approach is currently being tested and implemented by agricultural extension services in the Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati District municipality (North West province, South Africa). At this stage, the LLM concept should be seen as a continuous and evolving learning process that will be updated over the long term through decision support to include several other components essential to implement effective and sustainable rangeland management practices by local land users.

AB  - More than 190 articulate brachiopods from Turonian sections in northwestern Germany and southern England were studied for their stable carbon and oxygen isotopic composition, and some of them for their elemental composition. Most of the brachiopod shells are well preserved, and oxygen isotope composition reflects the temperate conditions of the European epicontinental sea. Upper Turonian mean delta O-18 values from Lower Saxony and southern England show bottom-water temperatures in the range of 14.2 to 18.2 degreesC (delta O-18(W) = -1.5 parts per thousand SMOW for an ice-free world). The relative trend of mean brachiopod oxygen and carbon isotopes shows a short-term (200 k.y.) increase in the mid-Upper Turonian horizons that confirms the climate cooling (similar to2 degreesC) observed in bulk-rock samples at different sites in Europe. Interbasinal comparisons between England and Germany show similar delta C-13 values in both basins, whereas oxygen isotopes are heavier in northwestern Germany than in England, suggesting a cool-water influence from the North Sea basin and temperate conditions in the Angle-Paris basin.

AB  - In this study, the effectiveness of different treatment systems in reducing pathogenic density levels was evaluated according to the criteria established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency municipal sludge rule (40 CFR Part 503 Rule). In a year-long effort, wastewater and biosolids samples were analyzed for both indicator, and pathogenic organisms from different existing treatment systems. The results indicate that anaerobic digestion was superior to aerobic digestion in reducing pathogen density levels under the given field conditions. Composting was far more superior to both anaerobic and aerobic digestion. This study demonstrates that the Class B requirements under the 503 Rule are reasonable and can be achievable by most existing treatment systems, whereas the Class A requirements under the same rule may not be easily achieved by many existing treatment works. The effects of volatile solids loading rates on anaerobic and aerobic digester performance were investigated. Under anaerobic digestion conditions, the log reductions in fecal coliform and fecal streptococci appeared to be dependent on volatile suspended solids (VSS) loading rates. However, this trend was not evident in aerobic digestion systems sampled. Salmonella density reductions did not appear to be dependent on VSS loading rates in either case.

AB  - In 1954, brown trout were introduced to the Kerguelen archipelago (49 degrees S, 70 degrees E), a pristine, sub-Antarctic environment previously devoid of native freshwater fishes. Trout began spreading rapidly via coastal waters to colonize adjacent watersheds, however, recent and unexpectedly the spread has slowed. To better understand the ecology of the brown trout here, and why their expansion has slowed, we documented the marine habitat use, foraging ecology, and environmental conditions experienced over one year by 50 acoustically tagged individuals at the colonization front. Trout mainly utilized the marine habitat proximate to their tagging site, ranging no further than 7 km and not entering any uncolonized watersheds. Nutritional indicators showed that trout were in good condition at the time of tagging. Stomach contents and isotope signatures in muscle of additional trout revealed a diet of amphipods (68%), fish (23%), isopods (6%), and zooplankton (6%). The small migration distances observed, presence of suitable habitat, and rich local foraging opportunities suggest that trout can achieve their resource needs close to their home rivers. This may explain why the expansion of brown trout at Kerguelen has slowed.

AB  - Bearing fault diagnosis at early stage is very significant to ensure seamless operation of induction motors in industrial environment. The identification and classification of faults helps to undertook maintenance operation in an efficient manner. This paper presents an ensemble machine learning-based fault classification scheme for induction motors (IMs) utilizing the motor current signal that uses the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for feature extraction. Three wavelets (db4, sym4, and Haar) are used to decompose the current signal, and several features are extracted from the decomposed coefficients. In the pre-processing stage, notch filtering is used to remove the line frequency component to improve classification performance. Finally, the two ensemble machine learning (ML) classifiers random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) are trained and tested using the extracted feature set to classify the bearing fault condition. Both classifier models demonstrate very promising results in terms of accuracy and other accepted performance indicators. Our proposed method achieves an accuracy slightly greater than 99%, which is better than other models examined for the same dataset.

AB  - Shrubs growing at higher latitudes and altitudes are considered to be highly sensitive to climate warming. In particular, alpine shrubs are potential climate proxies for understanding responses of high-elevation treeless ecosystems to warmer conditions. However, little is known about how alpine shrub radial growth responds to climate variables, specifically temperature and precipitation. This lack of knowledge is particularly notable in the Himalayas where shrubs reach some of their worldwide uppermost limits. Herein, we investigated the climatic response of alpine juniper shrub (Juniperus indica) to climate in two areas (dry Manang valley; wet Everest valley) situated in the central Himalayas. In spite of different sites and elevations, the radial growth of juniper shrub is positively correlated with spring precipitation in both areas, and also with summer precipitation in the dry area. Juniper shrub shares common climatic responses with Himalayan treeline tree populations, whose growth dynamics are also controlled by moisture availability. Thus, radial growth of juniper in the central Himalayas may experience drought stress if climate warming leads to drier conditions. We conclude that alpine shrubs are crucial indicators of the responses of alpine ecosystem to global climate warming.

AB  - Tourism companies operate in an increasingly competitive environment, where internationalisation becomes a tool in the search for improved positioning and image. Similarly, the international success of the sector is also considered an indicator of the effectiveness of promotional strategies and promotion of destinations to companies. In this sense, studies on internationalisation today are not sufficient to support destinations in terms of tourism policy, since they lack an adequate segmentation of companies in terms of type and origin. With the information provided by 60 company managers dedicated to nautical tourism, this article focuses on analysing the differences in the export profile of companies located in six competing nautical destinations. The study focuses on the Macaronesia region, Europe's leading destination for nautical activities. The data allow us to know the current conditions and limitations to the internationalisation of the sector in each of the destinations analysed, while contributing also to the elaboration of a series of recommendations on incentive policies that are better adapted to each context on an island and regional scale. The study also identifies the areas where destinations can work together, with the challenge that this represents for tourism management.

The authors focus on recent approaches to determine the role of dynamic capabilities within the strategic management framework. The authors identify the resource perspective, the process perspective, and the design perspective on dynamic capabilities. As the authors suggest, given the increasing scarcity of resources, dynamic capabilities become an essential source of competitive advantages. Unique organizational abilities make it possible to obtain economic rent in similar conditions. The study reveals that the crisis phenomena, including the 2008 global financial crisis, have triggered research interest in dynamic capabilities. As the research findings suggest, after 2008, the resource perspective usually dominates when studying the dynamic capabilities. A questionnaire is designed to assess the dynamic capabilities of business enterprises. The survey resulted in responses from 96 large, mediun and small businesses in high-technology sectors. In conclusion, criteria for assessing the dynamic capabilities of the economic activities of enterprises are identified.

AB  - To optimize suppression, restoration, and prevention plans against wildfire, postfire assessment is a key input. Since little research has been carried out on applying Sentinel-2 imagery through an integrated approach to evaluate how environmental parameters affect fire severity, this work aims to fill this gap. A set of large forest fires that occurred in northwest Spain during extreme weather conditions were adopted as a case study. Sentinel-2 information was used to build the fire severity map and to evaluate the relation between it and a set of its driving factors: land cover, aspect, slope, proximity to the nearest stream, and fire recurrence. The cover types most affected by fire were scrubland, rocky areas, and Eucalyptus. The presence of streams was identified as a major cause of the reduced severity of fires in broadleaves. The occurrence of fires in the past is linked to the severity of fires, depending on the land cover. This research aims to help fire researchers, authority managers, and policy makers distinguish the conditions under which the damage by fire is minimized and optimize the resources allocated to restoration and future fire suppression.

AB  - Correct measurement of the pH in highly acidic environments is still a challenge. In such conditions most of the pH indicators suffer from instability in air or leaching from host matrices due to the solubility considerations. In this work, two different fluorescent probes were used along with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and ionic liquid (IL) in the polymeric matrices for sensing of the pH in harsh conditions. The pH sensitivities of the probes were tested after exposure to strong acid vapors by steady-state, lifetime based and kinetic mode measurements. The sensing materials were fabricated in form of thin films and electrospun nanofibers. The ionic liquid; 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate was exploited as additive to enhance the stability as well as response towards pH. Spectral changes were tested in a large scale; between pH3.00-12.00. Utilization of the dyes in ethyl cellulose and polymethyl methacrylate along with AgNPs in form of electrospun fibers resulted in many advantages such as enhanced long term stability, sensitivity and improvement in all sensor dynamics. Sensing characteristics of the offered designs were tested after exposed to vapors of HCl, H2SO4 and HNO3, respectively.

AB  - Knowledge of an amputees' residual limb skin temperature is considered to be of particular importance as an indicator of tissue health. Temperature within the prosthetic socket typically varies over the range 25 degrees C to 35 degrees C and this warm, confined environment causes sweating which creates favourable conditions for both the growth of bacteria and an increased risk of tissue breakdown. With this in mind a wearable sensor for the real-time measurement of temperature variations at the prosthetic socket/liner interface is under development and a proof of concept prototype is presented. The sensor exploits the large pyroelectric effect present in ferroelectric lead zirconate titanate PbZrx(Ti(1-x)) O-3 (PZT) and has several inherent advantages over other methods of temperature sensing. The sensing element is a low cost commercially available thick-film PZT device. Mathematical models are developed to describe the sensor immitance and response to temperature change, and both the clamped and unclamped capacitances are investigated over the range 20 degrees C to 40 degrees C. Sensor characteristics were found to be dominated by the clamped dielectric constant and operation under short-circuit conditions is found to offer a constant sensor gain over the temperature range of interest.

AB  - Fossil fuel emissions and changes in net land use lead to an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration and a subsequent decrease of ocean pH. Noticeable effects on organisms' calcification rate, shell structure and energy metabolism have been reported in the literature. To date, little is known about the molecular mechanisms altered under low pH exposure, especially in non-calcifying organisms. We used a suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH) approach to characterise differentially expressed genes isolated from Platynereis dumerilii, a non-calcifying marine polychaeta species, kept at normal and low pH conditions. Several gene sequences have been identified as differentially regulated. These are involved in processes previously considered as indicators of environment change, such as energy metabolism (NADH dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase and ATP synthase subunit F), while others are involved in cytoskeleton function (paramyosin and calponin) and immune defence (fucolectin-1 and paneth cell-specific alpha-defensin) processes. This is the first study of differential gene expression in a non-calcifying, marine polychaete exposed to low pH seawater conditions and suggests that mechanisms of impact may include additional pathways not previously identified as impacted by low pH in other species.

AB  - Teleost fish include many different species, having a large economic and environmental impact. Glucose is a key source of energy for most vertebrate organisms. Fish as well as mammals maintain a specific level of blood sugar -glycaemia, which is influenced by multiple factors such as hormone production, diet, and temperature. Therefore, it is a useful indicator for scientists who need to check the immediate state of an organism. The most frequently used method of measuring glycaemia in farmed fish is spectrophotometry; however, this method is often inconvenient for field experiments. Here we report that basic spectrophotometry using oxidation of blood beta D-glucose by glucose oxidase (used in laboratory conditions) can be easily substituted with portable glucometer measurements, primarily designed for human samples. The possibility of use outside the laboratory and its small sample volume demands make this method very useful. Field studies often require fast sample processing and conditions of measurement are limited. Using the glucometer is a simple and elegant option. We tested 74 blood plasma samples (29 males, 45 females) of tench (Tinca tinca) both spectrophotometrically and using the human glucometer. Our results show a significant linear correlation (P < 0.001) between both methods. The main contribution of this study consists in comparability and interchangeability of results obtained from both presented methods.

AB  - The bulk density and resistance to penetration as indicators of recovery were studied with the objective to investigate the physical quality of a Red Latosol (Oxisol) under restoration for 17 years using green manures, soil correction, gypsum and pasture. The experimental design was a completely randomized with nine treatments and four replications. The treatments were: control (tilled soil without crop); Stizolobium aterrium; Cajanus cajan until 1994 and then substituted by Canavalia ensiformis; lime+S. aterrimum; lime+C. cajan until 1994 and then substituted by C. ensiformis; lime+gypsum+S. aterrimum; lime+ gypsum+C. cajan until 1994 and then substituted by C. ensiformis, the treatments were installed in 1992 and remained for seven years, in 1999 Brachiaria decumbens was planted; two other controls (native vegetation and exposed soil) were also used to compare. Bulk density, resistance to penetration and soil moisture were evaluated. The results were analyzed performing analysis of variance and Tukey test at probability of 5% to compare means. The treatments of reclamation are improving the physical qualities of soil and the results of treatment with C. cajan/C. ensiformis, lime and gypsum attained physical conditioning similar to soil under natural conditions.

AB  - Transition metals are essential enzyme cofactors that are required for a wide range of cellular processes. Paradoxically, whereas metal ions are essential for numerous cellular processes, they are also toxic. Therefore cells must tightly regulate metal accumulation, transport, distribution, and export. Improved tools to interrogate metal ion availability and spatial distribution within living cells would greatly advance our understanding of cellular metal homeostasis. In this work, we present genetically encoded sensors for Zn2+ based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. We also develop methodology to calibrate the probes within the cellular environment. To identify both sources of and sinks for Zn2+, these sensors are genetically targeted to specific locations within the cell, including cytosol, plasma membrane, and mitochondria. Localized probes reveal that mitochondria contain an elevated pool of Zn2+ under resting conditions that can be released into the cytosol upon glutamate stimulation of hippocampal neurons. We also observed that Zn2+ is taken up into mitochondria following glutamate/Zn2+ treatment and that there is heterogeneity in both the magnitude and kinetics of the response. Our results suggest that mitochondria serve as a source of and a sink for Zn2+ signals under different cellular conditions.

AB  - In this paper, an improved perturbation method is developed for the statistical identification of structural parameters by using the measured modal parameters with randomness. On the basis of the first-order perturbation method and sensitivity-based finite element (FE) model updating, two recursive systems of equations are derived for estimating the first two moments of random structural parameters from the statistics of the measured modal parameters. Regularization technique is introduced to alleviate the ill-conditioning in solving the equations. The numerical studies of stochastic FE model updating of a truss bridge are presented to verify the improved perturbation method under three different types of uncertainties, namely natural randomness, measurement noise, and the combination of the two. The results obtained using the perturbation method are in good agreement with, although less accurate than, those obtained using the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method. It is also revealed that neglecting the correlation of the measured modal parameters may result in an unreliable estimation of the covariance matrix of updating parameters. The statistically updated FE model enables structural design and analysis, damage detection, condition assessment, and evaluation in the framework of probability and statistics.

AB  - The analysis of the structure, topology, and dynamics of membrane polypeptides provides important clues for the understanding of their functional mechanisms. The interactions of these peptides and proteins are often characterized by a high degree of mobility, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy is a method that allows the monitoring not only of the structure but also of the dynamics of membrane polypeptides. Previously, it has been demonstrated that the N-15 chemical shift obtained from uniaxially oriented samples directly correlates with the alignment of the NH vector relative to the magnetic field direction and therefore also the tilt angle of helical polypeptides. Theoretical considerations indicate that under conditions of fast diffusion around the membrane normal the proton-decoupled N-15 spectrum obtained from polypeptides associated with non-oriented membranes should also be a good indicator of the helix tilt angle. Here we provide experimental proof of this novel concept and discuss its advantages and limitations. The approach opens up new avenues to investigate the interactions and dynamics of membrane-associated polypeptides, as it allows one to vary the environmental conditions in a manner not possible with oriented samples.

AB  - A high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system based on three-level flying capacitor (FC) multilevel converters with hybrid pulse-width modulation (PWM) is presented in this paper. Selective harmonic elimination PWM (SHE-PWM) is used during normal operating conditions and is switched to phase-shifted sinusoidal PWM (PS-SPWM) during an asymmetric network fault. The generation of the switching patterns under SHE-PWM control for each power device is described taking into account the natural balancing of the FC voltages. A new and simple control method for balancing the FC voltages when using SHE-PWM is proposed which is based on the small change of the firing angle according to the polarity of the load current. The FC voltage ripple under SHE-PWM control is estimated and compared to that under PS-SPWM. A method to implement the proposed hybrid PWM with capacitor voltage balancing is also provided. ' Simulation studies on a 300-MW/+/- 150 kV voltage-source converter transmission system are presented to confirm the satisfactory performance of the proposed system under active and reactive power variations and single-phase fault conditions.

AB  - The age concept is applied to an estuary to estimate time scales quantifying transport processes of dissolved substance for a spatially varying case. A real-time three-dimensional numerical model was applied to the tidal York River estuary, a western branch of the Chesapeake Bay, to calculate the age distribution for a Substance released from the headwaters of tributaries of the estuary under different hydrological conditions. The mean age, residence time, and turnover time were computed through a series of numerical model experiments. Both mean age and residence time are functions of freshwater discharge. The model results show that substantial time is required for a substance discharged into the system at the headwaters of the tributaries to be transported to the downstream estuary. It takes about 2 months and 3 months for the substance discharged into the headwaters to be transported to the mouth of the estuary under high flow and mean flow conditions, respectively. The results provide useful information for understanding the transport processes in the estuary and can be used to estimate dissimilative capacity of the estuary for environmental assessment.

AB  - Motorised vehicle conditions have been evaluated by many researchers. In contrast, there are very limited studies on vulnerable and non-motorised users, such as cyclists and pedestrians, specifically children, the elderly and the disabled. Thus, this paper reviews prominent studies on street evaluations to identify effective indicators for non-motorised trips. The street condition for these trips is measured by the bicycle level of service (BLOS) and the pedestrian level of service (PLOS). In previous studies, different methods have been introduced for PLOS and BLOS. However, these methods have several major shortcomings. First, pedestrians and cyclists are assumed to be users who can share street facilities with motorised vehicles and thus are considered equivalent to cars. Second, the majority of these methods are complicated and time-consuming, and it is difficult to connect them to a design process. Furthermore, these methods support only a limited number of walking and cycling facilities; therefore, they may not be valid for a wide range of pedestrians and cyclists with a diverse variety of abilities and ages. This study discusses the challenges in the BLOS and PLOS research and attempts to introduce new objectives for further studies in this field to eliminate the aforementioned shortcomings.

AB  - The development of an early evaluation method for host response of different Musa clones to black sigatoka was investigated under natural inoculation conditions in southeastern Nigeria. Two months old tissue-culture-derived plants of three plantain hybrids and parents of the hybrids were exposed to the natural inoculum of Mycosphaerella fijiensis in a field planted with a susceptible plantain cultivar. The response to M. fijiensis was evaluated on these young plants and on the same clones of mature, field-established plants. Young plants expressed similar resistance responses as mature plants and allowed an earlier evaluation of host-plant response to M. fijiensis. The male diploid banana parent, 'Calcutta 4', was highly resistant to black sigatoka. The three hybrids displayed partial resistance before flowering while the female parent, a triploid plantain, was susceptible. Disease responses of both mature and young plants ranked in the same order and were highly correlated (P = 0.01). Young-plant response to black sigatoka in Musa germplasm was shown to be a reliable indicator of mature-plant response and a quick means of disease reaction assessment. This could accelerate progress made by breeding programs when producing new black sigatoka-resistant germplasm. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - This study examined the use of microbial community structure as a bio-indicator of decomposition levels. High throughput pyrosequencing technology was used to assess the shift in microbial community of leachate from animal carcass lysimeter. The leachate samples were collected monthly for one year and a total of 164,639 pyrosequencing reads were obtained and used in the taxonomic classification and operational taxonomy units (OTUs) distribution analysis based on sequence similarity. Our results show considerable changes in the phylum-level bacterial composition, suggesting that the microbial community is a sensitive parameter affected by the burial environment. The phylum classification results showed that Proteobacteria (Pseudomonas) were the most influential taxa in earlier decomposition stage whereas Firmicutes (Clostridium, Sporanaerobacter, and Peptostreptococcus) were dominant in later stage under anaerobic conditions. The result of this study can provide useful information on a time series of leachate profiles of microbial community structures and suggest patterns of microbial diversity in livestock burial sites. In addition, this result can be applicable to predict the decomposition stages under clay loam based soil conditions of animal livestock. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Camelidae is currently extinct in Brazil. In this study, we present several cranial and postcranial specimens recognized as Camelidae, recovered from Gruta do Urso cave, southeast Tocantins state, Brazil. The specimens were identified as Palaeolama major, mainly due to the absence of protostylids and parastylids in the lower permanent molars. The Palaeolama major fossil record is bigger than the extant taxa record, which are restricted to cold and dry climates and indicates that Palaeolama major is not an good indicator of preterit climatic conditions. In accordance to previous studies, here it is proposed that Palaeolama major used to live in open environments. It is possible to infer that the presence of Palaeolama major in the Gruta do Urso surroundings indicates the existence of a ancient open environment close to the cave. Other fossil vertebrates recorded at the Gruta do Urso cave indicate cold and dry climatic conditions, such as the Tayassuidae Catagonus stenocephalus, the Equidae Equus neogeus, the Dasypodidae Propaopus sulcatus and the Didelphidae Thylamys sp. The decrease of open areas around the Gruta do Urso cave may have lead this taxon through its extinction. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB  - Quantitative analyses of calcareous nannofossils were performed on 50 ditch-cuttings samples from a well drilled in the northern Campos Basin, Brazil. Nine zones and two subzones were recognised in the Paleogene-Neogene section. The absence of zones NN9-NN7 (earliest late-latest middle Miocene), NP25-NP21 (Oligocene) and NP18-NP1 (earliest late Eocene-Paleocene) implies the occurrence of three stratigraphic breaks/unconformities within the studied interval. Nannofossil assemblages present suggest an open-ocean depositional environment under oligotrophic-surface water conditions for the Miocene section of the well. Hughesius spp. and Umbilicosphaera spp., here named the "small dark" group, were recognised as an index of high nutrient concentration. We suggest that small coccolith/nannolith size is a better indicator of eutrophic condition than taxonomic affinity. Morphometric analysis of specimens of Sphenolithus belemnos and Sphenolithus disbelemnos showed that size tends to decrease within the highstand system tract. The influx of nutrients associated with the highstand could explain this size reduction and may also support our hypothesis that small specimens are indicative of high nutrient concentrations in the surface water.

AB  - Diatom assemblages taken from outcropping sequences located on the cliffs of the Rio Negro Formation, northeast of Rio Negro province were studied. Paleoenvironmental interpretations of the area, during late Miocene early Pliocene, were performed. Diatom data were analyzed according to ecological tolerances of the taxa. Samples from minor sedimentary sections showed a paleoenvironment composed by aeolian levels with shallow interdune lagoons, with little water flow and high influence of aridness and evaporation. The diatomological flora was represented by fresh, brackish and sea water taxa. The lagoons were characterized by being shallow interdune, with an alternation between wet and dry conditions. During wet conditions, freshwater lagoons may have established by a higher water input from the combination of different processes such meteoric water increased and phreatic level rise. In dry periods, lagoons have modified their salinity from freshwater to brackish water due to increased evaporation because of aridity. An increase in the deposition of sandy sediments, the effect of wind and the reduction of the water would have concluded with the development of these two paleoenvironments. Besides, an episodic and marginal marine influence was inferred, due to the presence of allochthonous diatoms of marine origin.

AB  - The present research study focuses on the analysis and characterization of certain aspects of the dynamic behavior displayed by persistent chemicals in a multimedia environment (chemodynamics), which is jointly determined by the inherent physicochemical properties of the chemical substance under consideration, as well as underlying environmental processes such as degradation in different phases/media (soil, water and air) coupled with intermedia transport (interphase mass transfer). In particular, dynamic multimedia environmental models are considered with constant source terms describing steady chemical release/discharge rates into various environmental media of interest, and key risk-related aspects of the dynamic behavior of persistent chemicals are analyzed using perturbation theory techniques under conditions where degradation rates in different media are considerably slower than intermedia transport rates. Under the above conditions, the problem of defining physically meaningful and practical quantitative measures of overall persistence of chemicals in a multimedia environment is revisited, given its role as a key exposure-based indicator within all major chemical risk assessment frameworks, and a proof is provided that rigorously establishes equivalence between two important and popular persistence measures, namely the characteristic time at steady state and the inverse of the associated chemodynamics overall decay rate (slowest chemodynamic mode).

AB  - Research into the effects of environmental deprivation on negative symptoms of schizophrenia is limited, and few attempts have been made to differentiate secondary symptoms caused by the social environment. Japan's mental health system allows us to examine the extent to which understimulating social environments in hospitals contribute to negative symptoms of institutionalized patients while controlling for other factors. A random sample of inpatients of diagnosed with schizophrenia and hospitalized for I year or longer was drawn from the universe of inpatients attending a convenience sample of 20 hospitals across Japan. Data were collected for 549 study participants (a response rate of 91.5%). Measures included the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), other clinical condition scales such as the Manchester Scale, and social condition scales including the Nurses' Opinion Scale and the Ward Restrictiveness Scale. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to determine the contribution of social environment to negative symptoms. Results showed significant correlations between negative symptom scales and most of the social environment scales, where social environment scales accounted for 18% of the variance in SANS scores. The study confirms the influence of understimulating social environments in psychiatric hospitals on negative symptoms. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - During the past two decades, probabilistic risk analysis tools have been applied to assess the performance of new and existing building structural systems. Structural design and evaluation of buildings and other facilities with regard to their ability to withstand the effects of earthquakes requires special considerations that are not normally a part of such evaluations for other occupancy, service and environmental loads. This paper reviews some of these special considerations, specifically as they pertain to probability-based codified design and reliability-based condition assessment of existing buildings. Difficulties experienced in implementing probability-based limit states design criteria for earthquake are summarized. Comparisons of predicted and observed building damage highlight the limitations of using current deterministic approaches for post-earthquake building condition assessment. The importance of inherent randomness and modeling uncertainty in forecasting building performance is examined through a building fragility assessment of a steel frame with welded connections that was damaged during the Northridge Earthquake of 1994. The prospects for future improvements in earthquake-resistant design procedures based on a more rational probability-based treatment of uncertainty are examined.

AB  - Shelters play a key role in saving animals from straying. However, the space restrictions, the lack of resources and the high animal turnover can increase stress levels and the rate of infectious diseases in cats and dogs. The aim of this study is to evaluate, through the buccal micronucleus assay, the level of genomic damage in shelter cats and dogs with respect to that observed in family cats and dogs. The hypothesis is that stressful environmental conditions, such as those potentially present in shelters, can affect the level of genomic damage. Study population included thirty healthy mixed breed cats and dogs with a minimum two-year presence in a shelter. The control group consisted of thirty healthy cats and dogs living in a home environment, using age/sex matching. The micronucleus assay was performed on one thousand exfoliated buccal cells per subject. Significant differences were found between shelter and family cats and dogs in terms of micronuclei frequency, indicating that a condition of stress found in sheltered animals may increase the levels of genomic damage. The ethotest confirms the increased levels of total aberrations in both stressed shelter cats and dogs. Conversely, no significant differences in the level of genomic damage were found between the sexes, as well as no correlation was found between age and the frequencies of micronuclei. In conclusion, we provided evidence of a possible correlation between physiological stress conditions and increased levels of genomic damage in a sample of sheltered cats and dogs. The results of our study also suggest that the buccal micronucleus assay, also considering the relatively low cost of laboratory procedure and its non-invasiveness, could be potential additional tool that, combined with the ethotest, may be able to provide a more comprehensive picture of the health status of animals living in communities.

AB  - Neotropical migratory songbirds overwintering at mid elevations in the Andes of northern South America depend on remnants of native forest and shade-grown coffee plantations. The quality of such habitats is one of the primary ecological factors limiting survival of migratory birds during the non-breeding season. We assessed the relative quality of shade-grown coffee plantations vs. forest in the Colombian Andes as winter habitat for Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus). We hypothesized that native forest has a higher intrinsic value (i.e., food abundance) than shade-coffee plantations, as native forest was the original habitat for Swainson's Thrush. We compared thrush physical condition, density, feather corticosterone values, and apparent annual survival as indicators of habitat quality in these two habitats. Measures of body condition and density were higher in forest than in shade-grown coffee, while survival was similar between habitats. This implies that forest had a higher carrying capacity than shade coffee and therefore had higher intrinsic value. Seasonal trends in body condition revealed a decline in the quality of forest with the onset of the dry season in early winter and an increase during late winter in line with increasing rainfall, suggesting that the timing of the rainy season likely offsets the negative effects of seasonal drought. Feather corticosterone levels were higher in forest, possibly as a result of a density-dependent stress response, however, we cannot rule out the effects of food availability or its distribution in space on stress levels. Our indicators suggested that native forest is a higher-quality winter habitat than shade-grown coffee. Our findings highlight how individual indicators of habitat quality can be misleading and emphasize the value of using multiple measures. While shade coffee is a critical habitat in the absence of native forest and its importance for the conservation of migratory birds is widely accepted, our results indicate that the conservation of native forest must be a conservation priority wherever possible.

AB  - Palaeoclimate investigations in Sri Lanka have been rarely attempted despite being located directly in the path of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone. In this study, a 4.1-m undisturbed sediment core was retrieved from the Bolgoda Lake situated in the western coast of Sri Lanka, and influenced by the strong southwest monsoons. Mollusc shells in the core were dated, and the age-depth model indicated a depositional history extending from 2941 cal yr BP to the present. Grain size, major and trace elements, total organic C and N content and stable C and N isotopes were analysed in freeze-dried sediments to reconstruct the palaeoclimate changes. The multi proxy records in the core revealed four distinct zones that show distinct variations in physical and chemical conditions in the lake associated with climate change. Zone 1 (2941 to 2390 cal yr BP; 385-252 cm) indicated the climate to be warm and humid with intense precipitation. The resulting high lake level helped in organic matter preservation in bottom sediments. Zone 2 (2390 to 1782 cal yr BP; 252-140 cm) indicated an unstable dry period associated with weak precipitation. Consequently, low lake level and intense degradation of organic matter occurred in this zone. Zone 3 (1782 to 1299 cal yr BP; 140-60 cm) indicated a resurgence of intense monsoon along with warm and humid conditions. Zone 4 (1299 cal yr BP to present; 60-0 cm) indicated dry conditions with less intense monsoon, low lake level and extensive degradation of organic matter. Vascular plants were the predominant organic matter source into the lake during the late Holocene. In contrast, algal input was significant between 2390 cal yr BP and 2153 cal yr BP. The palaeoclimate evidences in this study showed an overall weakening trend of SW monsoon during the late Holocene, and this was consistent with changes happening in other locations as in southern and western India.

AB  - Oil shales were deposited in the Songliao Basin (NE China) during the Upper Cretaceous period, representing excellent hydrocarbon source rocks. High organic matter (OM) contents, a predominance of type-I kerogen, and a low maturity of OM in the oil shales are indicated by bulk geochemical parameters and biomarker data. A major contribution of aquatic organisms and minor inputs from terrigenous land plants to OM input are indicated by n-alkane distribution patterns, composition of steroids, and organic macerals. Strongly reducing bottom water conditions during the deposition of the oil shale sequences are indicated by low pristane/phytane ratios, high C-14-aryl-isoprenoid contents, homohopane distribution patterns, and high V/Ni ratios. Enhanced salinity stratification with mesosaline and alkaline bottom waters during deposition of the oil shales are indicated by high gammacerane index values, low MTTC ratios, high beta-carotene contents, low TOC/S ratios, and high Sr/Ba ratios. The stratified water column with anoxic conditions in the bottom water enhanced preservation of OM. Moderate input of detrital minerals during the deposition of the oil shale sequences is reflected by titanium concentrations. In this study, environmental conditions in the paleo-lake leading to OM accumulation in the sediments are related to sequence stratigraphy governed by climate and tectonics. The first Member of the Qingshankou Formation (K(2)qn(1)) in the Songliao Basin, containing the oil shale sequence, encompasses a third-order sequence that can be divided into three system tracts (transgressive system tract-TST, highstand system tract-HST, and regressive system tract-RST). Enrichment of OM changed from low values during TST-I to high-moderate values during TST-II/III and HST-I/II. Low OM enrichment occurs during RST-I and RST-II. Therefore, the highest enrichment of OM in the sediments is related to stages of mid-late TST and early HST.

AB  - Ground water discharge is often a significant factor in the quality of fish spawning and rearing habitat and for highly biologically productive streams. In the present study, water temperatures (stream and hyporheic) and seepage fluxes were used to characterize shallow ground water discharge and recharge within the streambed of Catamaran Brook, a small Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) stream in central New Brunswick, Canada. Three study sites were instrumented using a total of 10 temperature sensors and 18 seepage meters. Highly variable mean seepage fluxes, ranging from 1.7 X 10(-4) to 2.5 cm(3) m(-2) sec(-1), and mean hyporheic water temperatures, ranging from 10.5degrees to 18.0degreesC, at depths of 20 to 30 cm in the streambed were dependent on streambed location (left versus right stream bank and site location) and time during the summer sampling season. Temperature data were useful for determining if an area of the streambed was under discharge (positive flux), recharge (negative flux), or parallel flow (no flux) conditions and seepage meters were used to directly measure the quantity of water flux. Hyporheic water temperature measurements and specific conductance measurements of the seepage meter sample water, mean values ranging from 68.8 to 157.9 muS/cm, provided additional data for determining flux sources. Three stream banks were consistently under discharge conditions, while the other three stream banks showed reversal from discharge to recharge conditions over the sampling season. Results indicate that the majority of the water collected in the seepage meters was composed of surface water. The data obtained suggests that even though a positive seepage flux is often interpreted as ground water discharge, this discharging water may be of stream water origin that has recently entered the hyporheic zone. The measurement of seepage flux in conjunction with hyporheic water temperature or other indicators of water origin should be considered when attempting to quantify the magnitude of exchange and the source of hyporheic water.

AB  - Electrified transportation systems (ETSs) are affected by stray current problems impacting within and outside the right of way on reinforcement, buried metal structures and foundations. Stray current protection systems have recently been integrated in the track structure. Track electrical quantities are, thus, usually measured to assess track insulation and protection efficiency but should be backed up by additional measurements at the affected structures and installations, in order to assess their exposure and risk of corrosion. Ideally, a stray current monitoring system proceeds from the measurement of these quantities, to data collection and archival, to data presentation, analysis and prediction. Feasible sensors and probes, the impact of environmental conditions and uncertainty are considered for the measurement at the physical level. Data analysis is critically reviewed considering the variability of operating conditions and the effectiveness of each quantity as indicator of track insulation and protection efficiency. Given the normal spread of values, for data presentation and interpretation, suitable techniques are considered based on averaging, curve similarity and feature extraction, and also for the task of assessing compliance to limits or reference values and establishing a trend that may drive informed maintenance decision.

AB  - EU biodiversity conservation policy is based on the Habitats Directive (92/43/EC), which aims that habitat types and species of Community interest should reach 'favourable conservation status'. To this end, Member States are obliged to perform periodic assessment of species and habitat conservation status through biodiversity monitoring, which, in almost all cases, was performed by experts implementing standardized field protocols. Here, we examine the quality of data collected in the field by non-experts (citizen scientists) for the conservation status assessment of habitat types, and specifically for the criteria 'typical species', 'specific structures and functions', and 'pressures and threats'. This task is complicated and demands different types of field data. We visited two Natura 2000 sites and investigated four habitat types (two in each site) with non-experts and compared their data to the data collected by experts for accuracy, completeness and spatial arrangement. The majority of the non-expert data were accurate (i.e. non-experts recorded information they observed in the field), but they were incomplete (i.e. non-experts detected less information than the experts). Also, non- experts chose their sampling locations closer to the edge of the habitat, i.e. in more marginal conditions and thus in potentially more degraded conditions, than experts.

KW  - DURATION
AB  - Hydric soils in Holocene-aged barrier island landscapes in the Mid-Atlantic region of North America lack morphologies typically associated with saturated and reducing conditions. Furthermore, many better drained (nonhydric) soils have low chroma colors due to parent material effects, making identification and delineation of wetlands problematic. Our objective was to develop field indicators that could be used to effectively recognize hydric soils in these environments. Soils along 10 topographic transects were evaluated at Assateague Island National Seashore, Maryland. Transects spanned a gradient of topographic positions from dune crests to interdunal swales. Water tables and reducing conditions were monitored to determine hydric status. Soil descriptions along each transect were used to identify morphological features indicative of soil wetness. Of 16 monitored and documented hydric soils, only five met recognized field indicators. Hydric soils were best identified by the presence of matrix colors with chromas less than 2 in mineral soils or the presence of at least 1 cm of muck (Oa horizon). On the basis these characteristics, we propose two new indicators restricted for use in Holocene-aged barrier island landscapes in the Mid-Atlantic region. These indicators will allow identification of hydric soils, improving the accuracy and ease of delineation of wetlands.

AB  - Phytosociological and habitat studies were conducted on the water and swamp vegetation of astatic water bodies within north-eastern Poland. The phytocoenoses were selected on the basis of dominance of species forming the particular communities. The analysis of 147 releves showed the existence of 10 vegetation types: Lemnetum minoris, Spirodeletum polyrrhizae, Riccietum fluitantis, Elodeetum canadensis, Polygonetum natantis, Typhetum latifoliae, Caricetum elatae, Calletum palustris, Potentilletum palustris, Menyanthetum trifoliatae. Among the properties of water analysed water depth, SO42-, pH, total and carbonate hardness, pO(4)(3-), Ca2+, Mg2+ and Na+ were found to be most important in differentiating the habitats of the vegetation types studied. Substrate properties, which best differentiated the habitats of the associations studied were NOT, Na+, water content, pH and total N. In spite of the wide variability of habitat conditions occurring in astatic water bodies, particular phytocoenoses distinguished on the basis of dominance of one species were associated with specific habitats. The particular phytocoenoses or groups of phytocoenoses could be good indicators of various habitat conditions that occur within astatic water bodies or changes taking place in these habitats.

AB  - Computer simulations of fungicide loading in surface water runoff were conducted with fungicides commonly used in golf course fairways and lawns in Kentucky. For all fungicides, values for degradation half-life and organic carbon partition coefficient were obtained from published sources; other input parameters were selected to simulate conditions typical in local swards. Spray programs were tested using a 21-year period of weather data for Lexington, KY. Predicted amounts of fungicide in runoff were determined, and predicted fungicide concentrations in runoff (mg/liter) were compared with 50% lethal concentration (LC50) values for rainbow trout and Daphnia magna. All simulated chlorothalonil applications produced runoff with concentrations that greatly exceeded the LC50 values for both indicator species. For some applications, concentrations of azoxystrobin, iprodione, and pentachloronitrobenzne exceeded LC50 values of at least one indicator species. Under the conditions simulated, runoff concentrations of metalaxyl, propiconazole, thiophanate methyl, and triadimefon were well below LC50 values of the indicator species. Although actual amounts of fungicide loaded into runoff were relatively low, these simulations suggest that turfgrass applications of fungicides with high intrinsic toxicity to indicator species could pose a risk to populations of primary and secondary consumers in aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Numerous studies have demonstrated that glauconitic minerals predominantly form in water depths of mid-shelf to upper slope in modern oceans. These areas tend to have slow sedimentation rates, another commonly cited requisite for glauconitic mineral precipitation. Cambro-Ordovician strata from the southwestern US are rich in glauconitic minerals. Stratigraphic, sedimentological, and petrographic constraints indicate that the glauconitic minerals are autochthonous. In marked contrast to the modem environments of deposition, these Cambro-Ordovician strata formed under very shallow-water to tidal-flat conditions. The trough cross-stratified deposits of the most glauconitic mineral-rich accumulations (glaucarenites) indicate a high energy environment and probably a normal to high rate of sedimentation. The presence of fibroradiated rims of glauconitic minerals on glauconitic mineral pellets, echinoderm fragments, and quartz grains demonstrates that the Cambro-Ordovician glauconitic minerals precipitated on or in close proximity to the sea floor and prior to calcite precipitation. Consequently, glauconitic minerals must have formed under markedly different conditions in the lower Paleozoic than they do today. Thus, the occurrence of glauconitic minerals in the rock record cannot be used a priori as an environmental indicator of either mid-shelf and deeper water and/or a slow rate of sedimentation.

AB  - Contamination of freshwater habitats with microplastic is threatening particularly filter-feeders within the aquatic community. Using Daphnia magna and Daphnia pulex as models, the effects of food supply and temperature on the ingestion of polystyrene spheres (diameter 1 mu m, concentration of 200 ng*ml(-1)) was analysed. The ingestion rates of microplastic beads were increased in conditions of low food and high temperatures, reflecting the complex regulation patterns of the water current generated by the animals' thoracic limbs. Maximal enrichment of 1160 times the concentration in the ambient medium was observed within one hour. Analyses of the impact of microplastic ingestion on physiological parameters used the carbohydrate concentration as an indicator for the animals' metabolic state. Exposure to the microplastic beads for three days in the presence or absence of Desmodesmus subspicatus did not affect the animals' glycogen reserves beyond the response to the prevailing food and temperature conditions. Projecting the insights from laboratory experiments to the habitat situation, increased burdens of microplastic particles can be expected in filtering zooplankton organisms in warm water and scarce supply of food, like the clear-water phase of lakes in the summer.

AB  - The study deals with an integral assessment of hydromorphological and geoecological conditions of the Hukiv (flatland type of river), Dereluy (foothill type of river), and Vyzhenka (mountainious type of river) river basin systems (Figure 1). The indicators characterizing the river basin in the best way as a holistic system, the channel, floodplain, and watershed altogether, in natural reference conditions and in terms of human economic activity are addressed.
   The assessment hydromorphological test and geoecological monitoring of small rivers (SWOT-analysis) in accordance with the developed universal algorithm for hydromorphological assessment of small river basins for the sustainable development goals are generated and fulfilled. Interpretation maps for the sustainable development of the Hukiv, Dereluy and Vyzhenka rivers are created. The practical importance and relevance concerns the potential application of the proposed monitoring and the algorithm to solve methodological and applied problems related to the functioning of the systems "basin-river-human" and "basin-river-riverbed" in terms of modern human activity and needs; the need to modify consumer-type stereotypes for the use of natural resources, as well as to provide recommendations for enhancing the resource-efficient and sustainable activities in basin systems and small rivers.

AB  - This article presents the architecture and the performances of a long-range wide-area network (LoRaWAN) infrastructure used for data transmission from a floating sensor node placed in the middle of the sea to a multigateway structure positioned on the coast, whose purpose is the monitoring of offshore breeding cages within a fish farming plant. In particular, the sensor node is installed on a seamark buoy and it is interfaced with ad hoc sensors for the measurement of marine parameters. All sampled data are conveyed ashore to the Gateways by successfully covering the distance of 8.33 km. The article presents the results concerning the performances of the data transmission for a 70-day operating period, analyzing the radio parameters Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) in relation to the variations of environmental parameters, such as temperature, relative humidity and atmospheric pressure, as well as weather conditions. The proposed system demonstrates the usability of the LoRaWAN in all those cases where data collection from offshore monitoring structures is required; while this infrastructure focuses on the monitoring of fish farming plants, it may find application in several contexts, from navigational buoys to offshore oil plants.

AB  - Halodule wrightii meadows in Southern Brazil have been regressing in an unsheltered area of the subtropical Paranagua Bay, near their southern limit in the SW Atlantic, since 2006. To identify early indicators of regression events, we assessed variations in plant and macrobenthic structure in two local meadows under unsheltered and protected conditions. Differences between sites increased after an epiphytic overgrowth of the alga Hincksia mitchelliae at the unsheltered site. Seagrass growth was suppressed and the numbers of burrowing and opportunistic benthic species increased with the increase of algal biomass. In the protected meadow, seagrass biomass and number of leaves changed seasonally, but macrobenthic abundance and species richness remained stable. Ecosystem changes were evident when the unsheltered meadow was already collapsing. The number of leaves per shoot, the horizontal internode length, the abundance and structure of the macrofaunal associations, and the host-epiphyte surface interactions, were the first variables to reflect the early stages of seagrass regression. Our results suggest that the persistence of H. wrightii meadows at their southern distribution limit in the SW Atlantic will be affected by local hydrodynamics and their ability to compete with ephemeral macroalgal species under stress conditions.

AB  - The use of pH indicator as an approach to monitor the quality or freshness of foods has the attention of the food packaging industry. The use of natural resources, especially plant pigments of fruits and vegetables has now become the user's choice to replace synthetic dyes as indicators to ensure the safety of the food-consumed every day. In this study, bilberry extract was used for a pH-sensitive dye. The colour change of the sample was studied in details by chromametric and spectrophotometric methods. The bilberry extract was observed to produce bright red colour under acidic conditions, faded at neutral and changed from magenta to yellow in alkaline conditions. The results of detail chromametric studies showed that bilberry extracts were able to exhibit distinguishable colour changes at different pHs, which led to a change in a* value that eventually contributed to significant changes in the total colour difference (Delta E*). The Delta E* value also demonstrated a linear and quantitative relationships to certain pH ranges. Therefore, bilberry extract has the potential to be used as a sensor material in developing a pH sensor for the purpose of monitoring food freshness, especially packaged fishery products since deterioration level is closely related to alkaline pH changes.

AB  - Solar photocatalytic disinfection efficiency of novel visible light activated (VLA) photocatalysts was evaluated with the aim of assessing inactivation of Escherichia coli as the pathogen indicator organism present in drinking water. Influence of humic acid (HA) on the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency of the specified VLA TiO2 specimens i.e., N-doped, Se-doped, and Se-N co-doped TiO2 was also investigated. Photocatalytic disinfection efficiency was assessed by the enumeration of bacteria following selected irradiation periods. Degradation and compositional changes in organic matter (OM) was also tracked by means of UV-vis and advanced fluorescence spectroscopic (EEM features) parameters. Photocatalytic mineralization of the organic matter was followed by dissolved organic carbon contents. Presence of HA as a model organic compound of natural organic matter (NOM) displayed a retardation effect on solar photocatalytic abatement of E. coli. However, no distinctly different effect was observed under solar photolytic conditions due to the presence of HA. Regrowth of E. coli could not be assessed under the specified experimental conditions. A comparison was introduced with respect to the use of undoped TiO2 P-25 as the photocatalyst.

AB  - The influence of elicitation, time, and temperature of germination on the biological activity of wheat sprouts was studied. The total phenolics content (TPC), antioxidant activity (AA), and microbiological purity of seeds of three wheat cultivars elicited with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Y) and Salix daphnoides bark extracts (W) and their mixture (1 : 1) germinated in different conditions were studied. The increase of germination time caused an increase the TPC and AA for all tested wheat cultivars. Germination temperature also influenced these parameters. Generally the highest values in TPC were obtained for sprouts germinated at 20 degrees C. This tendency was found for all tested wheat cultivars. The highest values of TPC and AA were obtained after elicitation by S. daphnoides bark extract. The results of microbiological examination showed that generally for seeds germinated at lower temperature (15 degrees C and 20 degrees C) and during 2 and 4 days the molds were not detected and the levels of aerobic bacteria did not exceed the usually accepted limits. Taking into account both biological activity and microbiological purity of samples the best quality sprouts were in the most cases obtained for wheat germinated during four days at 20 degrees C and elicited by W.

AB  - The environmental profiles of five different Procter & Gamble (P&G) laundry detergents on the UK market in 2001 are analysed using Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA). Products analysed are: regular powder (RP), compact powder (CP), powder tablet (PT), compact liquid (CL) and liquid unit-dose system (LT). The analysis represents a 'cradle-to-grave' LCA for 1 wash under UK conditions for wash habits and infrastructure. Under the studs conditions, it is concluded that compact detergents (both powder & liquid) are environmentally preferable detergent formulations, mainly due to the lower use of chemicals, resulting in benefits on aquatic toxicity, eutrophication, ozone depletion and photochemical smog. Less pronounced benefits for CP and CL are also observed on energy requirements and on impact categories such as acidification, human toxicity and climate change. For most indicators, the outcome of the study is dominated (> 70% contribution) by the use stage (washing machine), which is common to all product formulations. Because of this, no significant differences are observed between scenarios using different laundry products. Hence, the present study demonstrates that for the 'cradle-to-grave' approach there is no single detergent formulation that is clearly outperforming all others on all indicators.

AB  - A series of cores (box and piston) were collected at 2 key locations in Lancaster Sound (cores 2004-804-009 BC and PC) and Barrow Strait (cores 2005-804-004 BC and PC) in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago to document the evolution of sea-surface conditions in the main axis of the Northwest Passage during the Holocene time period. Reconstruction of sea-surface parameters (summer temperature and salinity, duration of sea-ice cover) were estimated based on transfer functions using dinoflagellate cyst assemblages as proxy indicators. The chronology of these cores is based on calibrated AMS-C-14 dates, Pb-210 analyses, and correlations between paleomagnetic secular variations of the geomagnetic field and a predicted spherical harmonic model of the geomagnetic field (CALS7 K.2). Our age models for both cores indicate that 009 PC spans the last 11,100 cal BP, while 004 PC encompasses the last 10,800 cal BP. Calculated sedimentation rates are in the range of 43-140 cm/kyr for core 009 PC and 15-118 cm/kyr for core 004 PC, allowing for a millennial time scale resolution in each core. Our results indicate relatively harsh conditions in Lancaster Sound between 10,800 and 9000 cal BP (summer temperatures 2 degrees C cooler than at present), which we associate with the presence of active ice-streams in northernmost Baffin Bay and a weak West Greenland Current. This is followed by a warming trend (up to 3 degrees C higher than present) that took place between (similar to)8500 and 5500 cal BP, which we associate with the Holocene thermal maximum and to a large scale atmospheric pattern such as the Arctic Oscillation operating at the millennial time scale. This is concomitant with an increase in the relative abundance of phototrophic dinoflagellate cyst taxa. A gradual cooling of sea-surface temperature and increased sea-ice follow this from 5500 cal BP until the modern period. In Barrow Strait, harsh sea-surface conditions prevailed from 11,100 to 5500 cal BP, with summer temperatures as low as 4 degrees C cooler than at present. The warming trend occurred later in this region (between 5500 and (similar to)1000 cal BP), after which a gradual cooling is observed until the modern period. The apparent shift, or opposite warming trends, between Lancaster Sound and Barrow Strait after 5500 cal BP could be the result of a change in atmospheric circulation patterns related to a possible shift in the AO mode (from AO(+) to AO(-)). Comparison of ice core delta O-18 record from Devon Island ice cap and the reconstructed sea-surface temperature from core 009 PC suggests a strong atmospheric-oceanic coupling throughout the Holocene in this area.

AB  - Weather conditions and lake basin morphometry are of key importance in the study of sediment accumulation rate in lakes. This study aims to determine how these factors affect spatial and seasonal variations in sedimentation rate in the epilimnion and hypolimnion of Lake Gosciaz. To determine sedimentation rates. six sedimentation traps were set up at different locations and depths in the lake. Weather data were obtained from a meteorological station near the lake. Furthermore, temperature in the lake water column was measured continuously, and during field work oxygenation and transparency were also measured. Seasonal changes in sediment composition were analyzed on smear slides under microscope. The study showed that sedimentation rate increased as bottom steepness increased, and that there was more sediment in the hypolimnion than the epilimnion, especially in spring and autumn. There was a clear seasonal variation in early-spring and autumn peaks in sedimentation. The obtained results were significantly dependent on bottom relief, wind and air temperature through these factors' influence on water temperature. The results show that the sediment accumulation rate in Lake Gosciaz depends on the hydrodynamic conditions, which are determined by wind speed, wind direction, water temperature, and the shape and steepness of the lake basin. The relief features of the lake bottom and its orientation relative to the prevailing wind are significant factors in the spatial differentiation in sediment accumulation rate and composition of sedimenting material. It has been shown that the lake's shallow-water zone (littoral and sublittoral) is an important source of the material accumulated in the profundal zone. The patterns and mechanisms of the course of contemporary sedimentation in Lake Gosciaz, as determined based on the conducted investigations, can be applied in the study of other lakes and in assessing the representativeness of sampling sites for laminated bottom sediments to be used in palaeo-environmental studies.

AB  - The use of living mulch in orchards is a widely accepted management strategy for improving soil quality and enhancing tree productivity. Although the effects of living mulch on soil organic carbon (C) and nutrients have been previously investigated, changes in the stoichiometric ratios of C, soil total nitrogen (N), and soil total phosphorous (P) under different climatic, edaphic, and biotic conditions are currently unknown. These factors are important indicators of elemental balance associated with ecological interactions. In order to examine the effects of living mulch in orchards on soil C:N:P stoichiometry under different conditions, a meta-analysis was undertaken. The results showed that in general, living mulch significantly (P < 0.05) increased C:P and N:P ratio, while the impact on C:N ratio was not significant, a result that was related to the coupled increase of C and N. Phosphorous limitation occurred shortly after the addition of living mulch; after four years this effect receded. In contrast, an increase in C occurred simultaneously with N increase at all stages. Specifically, the treatment effect was context-dependent. The living mulch did not change soil stoichiometry in orchards with old trees (> 10 years), an occurrence which may be related to changes in the amount of fungi. Grass life history also had a significant influence on the treatment effect on soil stoichiometry, while N-fixing characteristics did not. The treatment effect was significant in areas with moderate mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation, which might be related to the litter ratio of grass and trees. Effects on stoichiometric ratios were significant in the top soil layer (0-20 cm), in contrast to the deep soil layers. Therefore, grass species and management practices, such as fertilization, should be selected according to the specific soil and climatic conditions of the management area.

AB  - Wildfire affects ecosystem processes, threatens human lives and causes economic loss. In forested wetlands of inland Australia, a better understanding of fire regime pattern is required given the dense population of fire-sensitive species such as Eucalyptus camaldulensis (river red gum). This study aims to investigate wildfire characteristics and the effects and relative contributions of ambient weather and antecedent rainfall on fire size in forested wetlands and the surrounding dry lands of the Riverina bioregion, New South Wales, Australia. Fires burned entirely in forested wetlands (FEW), fires burned partly in forested wetlands (FPW) and fires that did not burn in forested wetlands (FNW), are progressively incorporated into statistical analyses, in order to explore the change of effects and contributions of factors as the fuel type changes from litter/grass to shrub/grass.
   Forested wetlands and dry lands experience summer and spring-summer fire regime, respectively. Higher cumulative rainfall conditions of the 6th, 13-14th and 17-18th months before fire drive a larger size of FEW, while a number of factors representing the cumulative rainfall after the 18th month before fire positively affect fire size when FPW and FNW are being modelled. A larger fire extent is also driven by severer ambient weather conditions. Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) is more powerful in explaining the size of FEW, while the daily temperature becomes more effective when FPW and FNW are gradually incorporated, which supports the use of respective factors as indicators of fire danger in the two diverse ecosystems.
   Antecedent rainfall factors are more powerful than ambient weather in explaining the size of FEW, while they become less important when the surrounding lands are incorporated. After a high level of rainfall and under similar ambient weather conditions, priority of fire risk management may be given to forested wetlands since fire size is more sensitive to biomass accumulation in forested wetlands than in the adjacent dry lands.

AB  - Wood density is a quality indicator of wood raw materials, depending both on morphological and anatomical characteristics of trees, and on ecological conditions of their growth. The goal of research is to study the conventional pinewood density in various sites and to reveal the dependence of this indicator on its anatomical characteristics. We establish permanent sample plots in pine plantations of the Arkhangelsk, Severodvinsk and Verkhnyaya Toyma forest districts of the Arkhangelsk region. The conventional wood density is determined by the method of maximum humidity of samples of a relatively small volume. The conventional pinewood density in the northern taiga subzone is 0.340 ... 0.580 g/cm(3), it is lower by 7 ... 22 % in the middle subzone in pine myrtillus forests, and in mires. by 24 %. We mark a high strength of relationship of conventional pinewood density and the radial increment and age of plantation under different growth conditions according to the averaged values. However, at the tree or plantation level, we do not observe any correlation between these indicators, but a moderate strength of relationship between this indicator and the latewood percent. The authors establish a curvilinear correlation from moderate to significant between the thickness of walls of tracheids, lumen diameter, number of rows of early and late tracheids and conventional pinewood density; and only with the resin channels diameter it is high. We can describe the change in conventional density in the transverse direction of pine trunk by the following models: the model 1 is characterized by a decrease in the conventional density in the middle part of the trunk radius; the model 2 - by its increase in the middle part of the trunk radius; the model 3 - by an increase in the conventional density from pith to bark; the model 4 - by its decrease. The model 2 is the most frequent. We do not reveal the dependence of the model type on the tree morphometric characteristics. The highest conventional wood density in the central part of the trunk is typical for the majority (more than 67 %) of pine trees growing in line plantings and in mires.

AB  - Pekin ducks have an innate affinity for water. They seek water from the first day of life and use it for a multitude of behaviors. Currently implemented requirements to husbandry and the design of an animal-friendly offer of drinking water in commercial fattening establishments exist neither at EU-level nor in Germany. Aim of the study was to examine the use of the AquaDuc T (R) (Big Dutchman, Vechta, Germany) and its practical suitability concerning the behavior during the fattening of Pekin ducks under commercial conditions.
   The examinations took place in three farms (7140-13 515 fattening places). On farm 1 and 3, 16 fattening periods were observed (switch-over design: alternately test and control trial) with each one visited between day 28-32 and 35-39. On farm 2, only ten fattening periods could be examined. The ducks were in general supplied with drinking water via nipple drinkers. For the test trials, the AquaDuc T (R) drinkers were additionally installed and were accessible for a limited time. To record the natural and undisturbed behavior of the ducks in their housing system, the video recordings were started after we finished the farm visits and in total more than 6300 hours of video material were analyzed.
   All findings show that Pekin ducks clearly favor the round bell drinkers over the nipple drinkers. They enable the birds to immerse their heads, to drink and strain in a species-specific manner, to take care of the plumage with water and to clean beak and eyes. In the test trials, the drinking activity rose significantly during the operating time of the round drinkers (p < 0.001), whereas the nipple drinkers were used less frequently at the same time. Concerning ethology and health, the round drinkers offer the ducks very good conditions for an animal-friendly water supply. For economic and hygienic reasons, the daily access to the modified round drinkers should be limited.

AB  - While exerting no obvious function under "average" environmental conditions, the presence of certain plant specialists becomes crucial in the event of a complete failure of a community due to severe disturbance such as landslides. Plants capable of growing at erosion edges may act as potential edge-engineers by coping with unstable ground and stabilizing the soil with their roots. We hypothesized that life conditions at erosion edges select for a particular set of specialists or species with specific traits, the identification of which was the aim of the study. Across 17 small-scale transects (0.40 x 1.60 m) from intact meadows to landslide edges (Ursern Valley, Swiss Alps, c. 1,600 m a.s.l.), we quantified plant species abundance by the point intercept method and characterized growth conditions based on Landolt's indicator values, leaf delta C-13, and volumetric soil moisture in the uppermost soil layers. We observed a clear change of plant species composition and relative abundance from the meadow to the edge, presumably induced by the 25 % lower soil moisture and microclimatic exposure. Species richness at the edge was two-thirds of that in the meadow, but was positively correlated with species richness of the adjacent meadow. Species with "edge-preference" had either (1) rolled or festucoid leaves like Festuca spp., Avenella flexuosa and Nardus stricta, or (2) small, scleromorphic leaves like Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Calluna vulgaris and Thymus ssp. Graminoids with rolled/festucoid leaves were found to be the most dominant edge-specialists. The grass Festuca valesiaca s.l. emerged as the most dominant plant species at the edge, having an 11-times higher cover at the edge than in the meadow. In this montane grassland, a single species contributes to the stabilization of erosion edges and may be regarded as a potential keystone species for slope stability and regeneration after landslides even its role has not so far been established.

AB  - Chlorophylls absorb photosynthetically active radiation and thus function as vital pigments for photosynthesis, which makes leaf chlorophyll content (C-ab) useful for monitoring vegetation productivity and an important indicator of the overall plant physiological condition. This study investigates the utility of integrating remotely sensed estimates of C-ab into a thermal-based Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model that estimates land-surface CO2 and energy fluxes using an analytical, light-use-efficiency (LUE) approach to estimating bulk canopy resistance. The LUE model component computes canopy-scale carbon assimilation and transpiration fluxes, internally estimating fluctuations in effective LUE from a nominal (species-dependent) value (LUEn) in response to short-term variations in environmental conditions. LUEn, however, may vary on a daily timescale, responding to changes in plant phenology, physiological condition and nutrient status. Therefore, remote sensing methodologies for improving daily estimates of LUEn have been investigated. Day-to-day variations in LUEn were assessed for a heterogeneous corn crop field in Maryland, U.S.A. through model optimization with eddy covariance CO2 flux tower observations. The optimized daily LUEn values were then compared to gridded estimates of C-ab over the tower flux footprint, retrieved from a canopy reflectance model driven by green, red and near-infrared imagery acquired with an aircraft imaging system. The tower-calibrated LUEn data were generally well correlated with airborne retrievals of C-ab, and hourly water, energy and carbon flux estimation accuracies from TSEB were significantly improved when using C-ab for delineating spatio-temporal variations in LUEn. The study highlights the potential synergy between thermal infrared and shortwave reflective wavebands in producing valuable remote sensing data for estimating carbon, water and heat fluxes within a two-source energy balance framework.

AB  - The occurrence of extreme cyclones is analysed in terms of their relationship to the NAO phase and the dominating environmental variables controlling their intensification. These are latent energy (equivalent potential temperature 850 hPa is used as an indicator), upper-air baroclinicity, horizontal divergence and jet stream strength. Cyclones over the North Atlantic are identified and tracked using a numerical algorithm, permitting a detailed analysis of their life cycles. Extreme cyclones are selected as the 10% most severe in terms of intensity. Investigations focus on the main strengthening phase of each cyclone. The environmental factors are related to the NAO, which affects the location and orientation of the cyclone tracks, thus explaining why extreme cyclones occur more (less) frequently during strong positive (negative) NAO phases. The enhanced number of extreme cyclones in positive NAO phases can be explained by the larger area with suitable growth conditions, which is better aligned with the cyclone tracks and is associated with increased cyclone life time and intensity. Moreover, strong intensification of cyclones is frequently linked to the occurrence of extreme values of growth factors in the immediate vicinity of the cyclone centre. Similar results are found for ECHAM5/OM1 for present day conditions, demonstrating that relationships between the environment factors and cyclones are also valid in the GCM. For future climate conditions (following the SRES A1B scenario), the results are similar, but a small increase of the frequency of extreme values is detected near the cyclone cores. On the other hand, total cyclone numbers decrease by 10% over the North Atlantic. An exception is the region near the British Isles, which features increased track density and intensity of extreme cyclones irrespective of the NAO phase. These changes are associated with an intensified jet stream close to Europe. Moreover, an enhanced frequency of explosive developments over the British Isles is found, leading to more frequent windstorms affecting Europe.

AB  - During 1997 Papua New Guinea (PNG) experienced an intense drought. Emergency famine relief operations provided many subsistence agricultural communities with food, water and health provisions during the height of the drought. The locations of relief operations were based on a rapid and spatially explicit extensive field survey conducted at the height of the drought for all PNG. We have tested the utility of composite Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data to assist in a rapid assessment of drought conditions in PNG. Composited data were used to provide a means to overcome the frequent cloudy conditions that exist in PNG. To assess the drought we divided land surface temperatures(T-s) by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index(NDVI). The ratio (T-s/NDVI) increases during times of drought. This is due to the increase in T-s associated with more net radiation being partitioned into the sensible heat Aux and the decrease in NDVI associated with decreasing amounts of plant cover. A time series of T-s/NDVI is a rapid indicator of the drought at the country and province level. We calculated the integral under the T-s/NDVI curve for 1997, denoted integral (Dec)(Jan) T-s/NDVI, which allowed us to validate the assessment in two ways. Firstly, it was compared with field-based assessments of food supply (undertaken at the height of the drought) which classified areas into five grades. Plotting integral (Dec)(Jan) T-s/NDVI against the percentage area of each of the 14 mainland provinces experiencing food supply problems (so lives were at risk) showed a strong positively correlated relationship (r(2)=0.818). Secondly, for seven meteorological stations plotting integral (Dec)(Jan) T-s/NDVI against cumulative 1997 rainfall showed an inverse relationship (r(2)=0.809). Both forms of validation show that the composite AVHRR T-s/NDVI ratio provides a rapid means to assess drought conditions in a cloudy environment such as PNG.

AB  - Pinon juniper (PJ) woodlands have recently undergone dramatic drought-induced mortality, triggering broad scale structural changes in this extensive Southwestern US biome. Given that climate projections for the region suggest widespread conifer mortality is likely to continue into the next century, it is critical to better understand how this climate-induced change in vegetation structure alters ecosystem function (e.g., productivity, biogeochemical cycling, energy partitioning) in PJ woodlands. Data from satellite remote sensing could potentially help to gain some of this understanding. However, relatively little is known about the suitability of satellite remote sensing for monitoring mortality induced structural and functional changes in PJ woodlands, a semi-arid biome characterized by sparse vegetation that complicates remote sensing of vegetation properties. Here we examined the potential role of satellite remote sensing to better understand structural and functional changes that take place in PJ woodlands as they respond to and recover from climate induced mortality events. We used time series medium (30 x 30 m) and high (<= 5 x 5 m) spatial resolution satellite data in concert with eddy covariance-based gross primary productivity (GPP) data collected in a PJ woodland mortality manipulation near Mountainair, NM. Our results showed that both high and medium resolution satellite remote sensing data can provide ecosystem level assessments of overall canopy mortality and subsequent regrowth in these semiarid woodlands. However, high spatial resolution data allowed detecting the disturbance almost a full year earlier and enabled us to describe the spatially heterogeneous patterns of recovery typical for such complex. The ability of satellite remote sensing to be used to provide information about changes in ecosystem function was conditional on the presence of sufficient soil moisture; when soil moisture was present the strength of the linear relationship between GPP and spectral vegetation indices improved at the manipulated site (e.g. for high resolution NDVI data R-2 = 0.13 during drought conditions, R-2 = 0.46 when wet, P < .05) and less so at a nearby control site (R-2 = 0.09 during drought conditions, compared to R-2 = 0.22 during growing conditions, P < .05). Thus, although satellite time series can be used to monitor and improve our understanding of canopy function in both disturbed and undisturbed semi-arid coniferous biomes, combining in situ eddy covariance data with satellite time series demonstrated that the utility of these datasets is highest during periods of peak growing conditions. This study therefore provides a benchmark for understanding how spatial and temporal variation in vegetation structure and function can be best studied as semi-arid coniferous biomes respond to future climate variability.

AB  - Previous studies have estimated power plant cooling water consumption based on the long-term average cooling water consumption intensity (WI: water consumption per unit of electricity generation) at an annual scale. However, the impacts of the seasonality of WI and streamflow on electricity generation are less well understood. In this study, a risk assessment method is developed to explore the seasonal risk of water-electricity nexus based on the Integrated Environmental Control Model, which can simulate variable WIs in response to daily weather conditions and avoid underestimation in WIs as well as nexus risk during dry seasons. Three indicators, reliability, maximum time to recovery, and total power generation loss, are proposed to quantify the seasonal nexus risk under water consumption policy constraint represented by the allowed maximum percentage of water consumption to streamflow. The applications of the method in two representative watersheds demonstrate that the nexus risk is highly seasonal and is greatly impacted by the seasonal variability of streamflow rather than annual average water resources conditions on which most previous studies are based. The nexus is found more risky in the watershed with almost double mean annual streamflow and greater streamflow variability, compared with the watershed with less streamflow variability.

AB  - The research aims to evaluate the technical features and the performance of a large sample of biomass district heating plants (BDHP), mainly located in northern Italy and fuelled by wooden chips. These plants have determined the development of a local energy supply chain based on forest by-products, as an alternative to traditional fossil fuels. Main strength of the research is the representativeness of the sample (65 plants of different size and features) and the reliability of data collected. After a deep desk research, data were collected by a questionnaire and then refined and elaborated by an Excel database. Energy, environment and economy indices and indicators were calculated. Despite the large range of variation of results, the following improvements and drivers can be defined: reduction of heat losses between heat generation and final users; optimization of the matching between heat demand and supply during the day and taking into account the winter or summer operative conditions, and, in a smart district heating framework, integration of other renewable sources, cascade use of heat, cogeneration and district cooling (where needed).

AB  - The presence of microbial contaminants in urban stormwater is a significant concern for public health; however, their removal by traditional stormwater biofilters has been reported as inconsistent and inadequate. Recent work has explored the use of biochar to improve performance of stormwater biofilters under simplified conditions that do not consider potential effects of biofilm development on filter media. The present study investigates the role of biofilm on microbial contaminant removal performance of stormwater biofilters. Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were formed in laboratory-scale sand and biochar-modified sand packed columns, which were then challenged with Escherichia coli laden synthetic stormwater containing natural organic matter. Results suggests that the presence of biofilm influences the removal of E. coli. However, the nature of the influence depends on the specific surface area and the relative hydrophobicity of filter media. The distribution of attached bacteria within the columns indicates that removal by filter media varies along the length of the column: the inlet was the primary removal zone regardless of experimental conditions. Findings from this research inform the design of field-scale biofilters for better and consistent performance in removing microbial contaminants from urban stormwater.

AB  - Biological wastewater treatment process generates large amounts of sludge, the treatment and disposal of which incur substantial costs. Enhancement of sludge dewaterability is of great importance for decreasing the sludge disposal cost in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). This study proposes an innovative conditioning approach to improve the dewaterability of the anaerobically digested sludge (ADS) collected from a full-scale WWTP for the first time. The ADS dewaterability was significantly improved in the presence of persulfate (0-1.0 g/g TS; TS: total solids) and zero valent iron (ZVI) (0-4.0 g/g TS) at neutral pH. The largest improvement of ADS dewaterability was obtained at 2.0 g ZVI/g TS and 0.5 g persulfate/g TS, under which the capillary suction time (an indicator of sludge dewaterability) was decreased by approximately 90%. Compared with the traditional Fenton process (Fe2+ + H2O2 at pH 2.0), economic analysis indicated that the ZVI-persulfate conditioning process is more economically attractive for enhancing ADS dewaterability.

AB  - The impacts of water deficit imposed at either the germination stage or the reproductive stage on biological traits of 37 semiwinter rapeseed varieties were analysed. The osmotic stress induced by 14% polyethylene glycol had a substantial impact on seed germination and caused significant reductions in plant growth and seed vigour. Relative water content was identified as a good indicator for early screening of drought resistance. At the reproductive stage, seed yield, 1000-seed weight, height of the first branch, plant height and number of pods per plant were all markedly reduced under the exceptionally long and severe drought condition. Two of the top three resistant genotypes at the germination stage were also shown to be resistant based on the drought susceptibility index for seed yield. Phenotypic correlation and path analyses were employed to rank the relative importance of other agronomic traits with regard to seed yield. The important contributors to seed yield under drought conditions, in descending order, were as follows: 1000-seed weight, days to maturity, number of pods per plant and plant height.

AB  - The scientific contribution builds on the previous scientific studies analysing the determinants of productivity and economic efficiency of the agricultural entities and extends the knowledge of the spatial econometrics area at the NUTS IV level (at the district level) for the reporting period. The paper aimed to assess the development of productivity and economic efficiency of the agricultural entities in the reporting period based on the synthetic evaluation of the selected economic indicators by the methods of cluster analysis, and so to create a spatial map according to the regional differentiation at the NUTS IV level. On the basis of the completed analysis, we can conclude that the natural and climatic conditions have a dominant influence on the achievable productivity and economic efficiency of the agricultural entities in ensuring the sustainability of the economic performance of agriculture in different regions of Slovakia. On the basis of conducting the analysis, there were clearly defined two relatively coherent areas in Slovakia (at the district level), which are characterized by differences in the achieved production indicators and allow the regional differentiation of Slovakia into districts with more and less prosperous agricultural enterprises.

AB  - Red colobus monkeys, due to their sensitivity to environmental change, are indicator species of the overall health of their tropical rainforest habitats. As a result of habitat loss and overhunting, they are among the most endangered primates in the world, with very few viable populations remaining. Traditionally, extant indicator species have been used to signify the conditions of their current habitats, but they have also been employed to track past environmental conditions by detecting previous population fluctuations. Kibale National Park (KNP) in Uganda harbors the only remaining unthreatened large population of red colobus. We used microsatellite DNA to evaluate the historical demography of these red colobus and, therefore, the long-term stability of their habitat. We find that the red colobus population throughout KNP has been stable for at least similar to 40,000 years. We interpret this result as evidence of long-term forest stability because a change in the available habitat or population movement would have elicited a corresponding change in population size. We conclude that the forest of what is now Kibale National Park may have served as a Late Pleistocene refuge for many East African species.

AB  - Shocked meteorites that were formed when their parent body underwent shock metamorphism often contain the mineral plagioclase either in an amorphous form or in its high-pressure phase. The peak pressures in shock metamorphism can be constrained by shock-recovery experiments that determine the amorphization pressures of plagioclase(1-3). However, in these experiments temperatures have been unrealistically low and timescales much shorter than those in natural events. Here we present in situ X-ray diffraction measurements of two kinds of plagioclase feldspar in conditions of increasing pressures and temperatures. We find that the amorphization pressure of plagioclase decreases with increasing temperature, suggesting that previous studies overestimated this parameter(1-3). We also found that the mineral jadeite forms first from amorphous plagioclase, whereas the nucleation of other minerals such as stishovite or garnet is significantly delayed. The occurrence of jadeite in shocked meteorites that do not contain stishovite(4-8) can therefore be explained as a result of the crystallization kinetics. We conclude that the study of plagioclase breakdown can constrain the pressure-temperature-time history of shock events, and thus help to reconstruct the collisional history of asteroids in the early Solar System.

AB  - Dinoflagellate cyst (dinocyst) assemblages were analyzed in 43 surface sediment samples from the Barents Sea. They can be divided into five major assemblage types, the distribution of which can clearly be linked to the overlying water masses. Notably, a very clear distinction between sites influenced by Atlantic water and Arctic water, respectively, is seen in the change in dominance from O. centrocarpum s.l. to I. minutum and is strongly related to sea-surface temperature. More subtle hydrographical features are also recorded in the assemblages, as can be seen from the spatially coherent distribution of the Atlantic assemblages, which allows discrimination between the Norwegian Coastal Current zone, the Norwegian Atlantic Current zone and two regions of modified Norwegian Atlantic Current waters. Here sea-surface temperature does not seem to be the primary parameter controlling the distribution of the assemblages. Multivariate analyses suggest that the assemblages are associated with the stratification and productivity annual cycles. Cysts of P. dalei seem to favour stratified environments, while O. centrocarpum s.l. might be more adapted to unstable conditions. Cysts of P dalei are also associated with early spring stratification and productivity, whereas other species such as S. ramosus are related to late spring/summer productivity and stratification.

AB  - Although the eye lens mass method has long been used for determining age in small rodents from natural populations, the effects of breeding on growth rates of lenses are rarely considered. Under laboratory conditions, we examined eye lens mass in two groups of 100-day old females of the common vole (Microtus arvalis) : one comprising the females that have already bred, each delivering two litters, and another comprising controls that did not reproduce. The breeding females were heavier than the nonbreeding ones and also had heavier dried eye lenses. However, the effect of breeding on eye lens mass disappeared when the variation in body mass was accounted for in the statistical model. The total number and mass of offspring that the females produced did not affect the lens mass. We conclude that different reproductive histories did affect the growth of eye lens in female common voles through its influence on body size. These results suggest that besides age, the construction of calibration curves for aging voles in natural populations should also include individual body mass as an additional covariate to account for variation in body mass due to differences in reproductive condition.

AB  - Geographic variation in morphology reflects phenotypic responses to environmental gradients and evolutionary history of populations and species and may indicate local or regional changes in environmental conditions. The pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea) illustrates these principles. At local scales, its morphology reflects nutrient availability. At points along its broad geographic range (from Florida to northern Canada) morphology has been used to distinguish subspecies and varieties, but there has been no detailed study of the continuum of morphological variation across this entire range. Patterns Of Morphological variation in S. purpurea were characterized as a function of climatic and environmental conditions at 39 sites spanning its range. Differences in pitcher size and shape were strongly correlated with temperature, annual precipitation, and availability of ammonium and calcium in peat pore water. Pitcher shape (lip width, mouth diameter, and pitcher width) in Florida panhandle populations differed significantly from pitcher shape of all other populations, even after accounting for environmental correlations. In contrast, the northern and southern subspecies of S. purpurea (the latter exclusive of the Florida panhandle populations) cannot be distinguished based on these morphological measurements alone. These results support a recent proposal that identifies the Florida populations as a distinct species, Sarracenia rosea.

AB  - Phytosociological and habitat studies of the phytocoenoses of Luronium natans have been conducted. The present results were compared with data on L. dortmanna and L lacustris. It is demonstrated that the community of L. natans differs from the other two communities with respect to habitat conditions despite the fact that they have been reported to occur jointly and alongside in Lobelia lakes. It appears that significant differences between the communities are found not only regarding their waters, but also their substrates. L. natans dominated phytocoenoses are confined to oligotrophic, extremely soft waters, markedly poor in Ca2+, but richer in Na+ and SO42- than those of Lobelia and Isoetes. Luronium natans develops best on acidic, highly hydrated substrates rich in organic matter, NO3- and total N. The results obtained indicate that L. natans and the phytocoenoses formed by it are characterized by their narrow ecological amplitude in Poland as opposed to those occurring in western Europe, which tolerate a relatively wide range of habitats. The present findings confirm the data from numerous works, which point to the weak competitive ability of the species compared with species typical of eutrophic waters.

KW  - Hinkley Point C nuclear power station construction
AB  - Major projects, in sectors such as transport, energy, minerals and water, have long life cycles and can have significant local and regional environmental and socio-economic impacts. The impacts of the construction stage can be particularly damaging, if not managed well. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) seeks to anticipate such impacts, mitigate adverse and enhance positive impacts through design innovations and associated conditions. However, the approach is only as good as the implementation of such innovations and conditions. The issue of monitoring and auditing of actual, as against predicted, impacts is an Achilles heel in the planning and assessment process. Hinkley Point C (HPC) nuclear power station in the UK is currently one of the largest construction projects in Europe. A recent study of the live project provides a unique insight into the actual local impacts of the early construction years, and appropriate methods of assessment. It identifies KPIs, examines monitoring data, and audits findings against the predictions. The results show varying performance across key impact sectors. Explanations of differences are set out, together with recommendations for improving monitoring and auditing practice.

AB  - Despite advances made in its understanding and treatment, chronic pain remains an unsolved and all too common problem. One of the main obstacles to successful management of pain is the high variability of many patients regarding both response to treatment and susceptibility to adverse effects, which curtails the utility of therapeutic intervention. Understanding the causes of this variability is an important challenge which may lead to a new era in rational pain management. As described in this review, however, there currently seems to be more than one possible explanation of this variability. Rational personalized pain management must take into consideration both ever-increasing knowledge of pharmacogenetics and pharmacokinetics and a broad, clinically based attitude incorporating co-morbidities, both physical and psychiatric, and concomitant medications. Novel models for testing in-vivo pain processing, for example assessment of conditioned pain modulation (CPM), are also promising approaches to use of rational data for empirical treatment of pain. Last, listening to the patient and understanding the context in which pain has affected his or her life is an important part of maintaining the personal nature of therapeutic interaction with patients suffering from pain.

AB  - Relational aggression is a form of covert or indirect aggression or bullying in which harm is caused through damage to relationships or social status within a group, rather than through physical violence. We compare findings from empirical research into relational aggression with the depictions, interpretations and interventions described in trade-books and popular media dealing with that same topic. Relational aggression is more common and more studied among girls than boys and is popularly described as synonymous with "mean-girl" behaviors. We investigate the degree that popular trade books and movies accurately portray findings from researched investigations including the incidence and indicators of the condition and its remedies. We determine that there is a great deal of similarity between these two sources in how relational aggression is understood and how it may be treated. The concurrence across both dissemination formats reflects terminology and definitions, the harmful effects of relational aggression, the gender-specific nature of the condition to women and girls, its age of occurrence, the impact of parenting styles, its relationship to girls' social competence, and nature of its expression through non-physical means.

AB  - The riverscape perspective recognizes the heterogeneous habitat types within the stream corridor as a single, integrated ecological unit operating across spatial scales. Although there is ample evidence that the riverscape notion is appropriate in understanding the physical phenomena of stream corridors, significantly less attention has focused on its ecological ramifications. To this end, we surveyed riverscape habitat variables and bird community characteristics in the Champlain Valley of Vermont, USA. From the data collected, we used information theoretic methodology (AIC(c)) to model relationships between bird community attributes and key habitat variables across the riverscape. Our models with the greatest support suggest that riverine bird communities respond to a suite of characteristics; representing a variety of riverscape habitats at the in-stream, floodplain, and riparian levels. Channel slope, drainage area, percent conifers, and in-stream habitat condition were among the most influential variables. We found that piscivores are potentially important indicators of riverscape condition, responding to a host of variables across the riverscape. Our results endorse a holistic approach to assessing and managing the mosaic of patches in the riverscape and suggest that a riverscape approach has significant conservation potential.

AB  - Estimation of daily survival probabilities of nests is common in studies of avian populations. Since the introduction of Mayfield's (1961, 1975) estimator, numerous models have been developed to relax Mayfield's assumptions and account for biologically important sources of variation. Stanley (2000) presented a model for estimating stage-specific (e.g. incubation stage, nestling stage) daily survival probabilities of nests that conditions on "nest type" and requires that nests be aged when they are found. Because aging nests typically requires handling the eggs, there may be situations where nests can not or should not be aged and the Stanley (2000) model will be inapplicable. Here, I present a model for estimating stage-specific daily survival probabilities that conditions on nest stage for active nests, thereby obviating the need to age nests when they are found. Specifically, I derive the maximum likelihood function for the model, evaluate the model's performance using Monte Carlo simulations, and provide software for estimating parameters (along with an example). For sample sizes as low as 50 nests, bias was small and confidence interval coverage was close to the nominal rate, especially when a reduced-parameter model was used for estimation.

AB  - Waste materials made by humans and heaped up in the landscape offer the opportunity to investigate the process of primary succession. In order to improve reclamation, the relationship between plant species themselves and environmental factors during vegetation development must be taken into account. For detecting these interactions, a study was set up on virgin colliery mine spoil using a seed mixture of 49 ruderal species based on phytosociological considerations. The restoration treatments applied were the application of sand and fertilizer. The research area comprised 10 000 m(2), including different exposures and two kinds of mine spoil. Cover is thought to be an indicator for the state of vegetation development but it varied with site conditions and time. Life history traits of certain species and weather conditions also interfered during 10 years of investigation. Total species number resulted from sown and airborne propagules. Comparing its changing value with the development of cover degree revealed that neither cover nor species diversity seems to be suited to assess the state of vegetation with respect to succession. Species composition and dominance of certain species, however, represented the process in a more precise way. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Beyond meeting power demand, switching to solar energy especially solar photovoltaic (PV) offers many advantages like modularity, minimal maintenance, pollution free, and zero noise. Yet, its cell modeling is critical in design, simulation analysis, evaluation, and control of solar PV system; most importantly to tap its maximum potential. However, precise PV cell modeling is complicated by PV nonlinearity, presence of large unknown model parameter, and absence of a unique method. Since number of model parameters involved is directly related to model accuracy, and efficiency; determination of its values assume high priority. Besides, application of meta-heuristic algorithms via numerical extraction is popular as it suits for any PV cell/module types and operating conditions. However, existence of many algorithms have drawn attention toward assessment of each method based on its merits, demerits, suitability/ability to parameter estimation problem, and complexity involved. Hence, few authors reviewed the subject of PV model parameter estimation. But existing reviews focused on comparative analysis of analytical and meta-heuristic approaches, analysis of models, and application of meta-heuristic methods for model parameter extraction. Thus, lack a comprehensive analysis on methods based on different objective function, assessment on environmental conditions, and cumulative analysis on selective set of algorithm based on efficiency. Therefore, this work reviews optimization algorithms presented for parameter estimation focusing on (a) objective function used, (b) modeling type, (c) algorithm employed for parameter extraction, and (d) PV technology. Further, provides a comprehensive assessment on various modules types used for validation, comparisons made with methods, advantages and disadvantages associated with each method with respect to parameter estimation platform, critical analysis on each method at STC, and varying irradiance conditions. In addition, a critical evaluation on specific set of algorithm based on objective function values is also carried out. Thus explores and display the characteristics of various techniques related to PV cell modeling and serve to be a single reference for researchers working in the field of PV parameter estimation.

AB  - The relevance of the research is caused by the need to obtain objective information about the patterns of territorial and temporal variability of vegetation state and the factors that determine it for the most effective use of lands in extreme natural and socio-economic conditions in the Republic of Iraq.
   The aim of the research is to analyze the dynamics of vegetation of territories of the four provinces in Central Iraq using the normalized difference vegetation index NDVI in the period from 2014 to 2017.
   The objects of the research are territories of Central Iraq: Babil, Baghdad, Wasit and Diyala. The subject of the study is temporal-territorial variability of vegetation state.
   Methods: remote sensing, thematic mapping, image processing, spatial data analysis, statistical analysis.
   Results. Patterns of temporarily-territorial dynamics of vegetation state in Central Iraq were revealed using vegetation index NDVI calculated with remote sensing data obtained by Landsat-8. Regional features of the vegetation structure and the rate of its state change were established. The maximum areas of non-vegetated territories were found in Baghdad and Wasit; covered by vegetation of most classes - also in Wasit; covered by dense vegetation - in Diyala, marked as well by minimum of barren areas. Babil is characterized by minimum area covered by vegetation. Baghdad in the studied indicators is intermediate. These patterns are poorly consistent with the absolute values of the province areas. They are caused by the prevailing economic conditions and are manifested in the qualitative and quantitative heterogeneity of the distribution of vegetation in the provinces. During the active stage of vegetation, from February to March, the variations in areas of non-vegetated territories, occupied by moderate and dense vegetation, are stable. At the same time, the variability of areas of territories with very dense vegetation is growing, with weak vegetation and vegetation of maximum density decreases. A correlation analysis between NDVI values and weather conditions did not reveal any significant relationships.

AB  - The potential impacts of future climate scenarios on water balance and flow regime are presented and discussed for a temporary river system in southern Italy. Different climate projections for the future (2030-2059) and the recent conditions (1980-2009) were investigated. A hydrological model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) was used to simulate water balance at the basin scale and streamflow in a number of river sections under various climate change scenarios, based on different combinations of global and regional models (global circulation models and regional climate models). The impact on water balance components was quantified at the basin and subbasin levels as deviation from the baseline (1980-2009), and the flow regime alteration under changing climate was estimated using a number of hydrological indicators. An increase in mean temperature for all months between 0.5-2.4 degrees C and a reduction in precipitation (by 4-7%) was predicted for the future. As a consequence, a decline of blue water (7-18%) and total water yield (11-28%) was estimated. Although the river type classification remains unvaried, the flow regime distinctly moves towards drier conditions and the divergence from the current status increases in future scenarios, especially for those reaches classified as I-D (ie, intermittent-dry) and E (ephemeral). Hydrological indicators showed a decrease in both high flow and low flow magnitudes for various time durations, an extension of the dry season and an exacerbation of extreme low flow conditions. A reduction of snowfall in the mountainous part of the basin and an increase in potential evapotranspiration was also estimated (4-4.4%). Finally, the paper analyses the implications of the climate change for river ecosystems and for River Basin Management Planning. The defined quantitative estimates of water balance alteration could support the identification of priorities that should be addressed in upcoming years to set water-saving actions.

AB  - Drought stress affects plants leaving a long-lasting imprint that may be passed onto progeny, affecting its growth and functioning. The aim of the research was to analyse the transgenerational effect of intense drought on alterations in functioning and changes in the growth of shoot and roots of spring barley. Barley seeds from a maternal generation that were affected by intense drought stress at the flag leaf stage or grown in the optimum conditions throughout the vegetation period were used as a sowing material to analyse the growth of a progeny-generation at drought or in soil at optimum soil moisture. The difference in water. availability during the growth of the progeny generation significantly affected all measured indicators of plant growth and functioning. However, significant differences were also found between offspring growing in the same conditions but characterised by,different water availability during the growth of the maternal generation. The differences between plants with different stress histories in the maternal generation were more pronounced in barley offspring grown at drought than at optimum soil water availability. The drought induced during the growth of the barley maternal generation decreased the shoot-to-root mass ratio, enhanced growth of thin roots, and reduced the number of thick roots in the progeny grown at drought, compared to plants that were grown in the same conditions but without drought in the maternal generation. Maintenance of relatively long roots at low allocation of biomass to roots at drought in the progeny of the stressed maternal generation may be an adaptive response that can minimise carbon cost of water and nutrient acquisition.
   The results obtained may have implications in the prediction of responses of crops and, ecosystems to drought and in proper design of scientific experiments on plant responses to water availability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Developmental stability (DS) or homeostasis refers to the ability of an individual to produce a consistent phenotype in a given environment. Reduced DS can result from a wide variety of environmentally (or genetically) induced perturbations. The main aim of the presented paper is to highlight the importance of the differences in ability Tilia cordata leaves to buffer their development under contrasting environmental conditions and points to the concept that developmental stability is character specific.
   Materials and Methods: Three different techniques were performed in this study: fluctuation asymmetry (FA) and leaf size as integrative measures of environmental stress during leaf developmental processes and within-plant variance in leaf morphology, presented as coefficient of morphological variation (CV). The study tested the hypothesis that the population from a chronically polluted area would express greater developmental instability in leaf traits. Two bilateral, linear dimensions on each leaf leaf width (LW) and lobe length (LL) were analyzed.
   Results: The three different measures of developmental stability all showed a trend for T cordata leaves in the polluted area to be developmentally less stable than leaves from the reference area. Leaves in the reference area were significantly larger compared with those from the polluted site. Although leaves tend to be larger on the outside of a tree's crown, the pattern found here was the reverse. Both, outside and inside leaves from the polluted area had significantly higher FAs than leaves front the sante position sampled in the reference area for both traits. Within-tree variance assessed as CV showed that LL was a more variable measure than LW Moreover, the data suggest that LL is under more selective pressure to adapt to current environmental conditions than LW.
   Conclusions: Obtained data suggest that T cordata leaves may represent a reliable indicator for developmental stability evaluation studies based on an assay using a combination of end-points. Furthermore, my results highlighted the differences in ability of leaf morphometric characters to buffer their development under contrasting environmental conditions.

AB  - A deep borehole through Ribbon Reef 5 in the Great Barrier Reef off north-eastern Australia has identified a variety of cements, including epitaxial, radial prismatic and spherular aragonite, together with blocky, prismatic and fibrous calcite. These cements are discontinuously arranged within the sequence that consists predominantly of grainstones but locally includes clotted muddy and filamentous textures that may be of microbial origin. Calcite cements vary in morphology with groups of crystals that include acute scalenohedral, rhombohedral and flattened concordant terminations; these show varying densities of inclusions that locally define growth zones and in some terminations divide in the manner of 'split crystals' to form fibrous fringes. Morphological changes in calcite are inferred to reflect changes in water chemistry and crystal growth rates at the time of growth, allied to their relationship to the palaeo-water table, and linked in turn to changes in sea-level. Neomorphism and dissolution are widespread and variations in the severity of both imply response to the degree of undersaturation of pore waters that at times were probably balanced within very narrow limits. A total of 10 depositional units are identified. Those units at the base of the borehole reflect deposition and diagenesis within a marine environment. The influence of meteoric waters, indicated by stable isotopes, is first apparent at the top of Unit 1 and in Unit 2 (184 to 155 m below sea floor). Petrographic evidence of vadose conditions appears at the tops of Unit 3 (131 to 99 m below sea floor). Units 4 to 8, all deposited under marine conditions, provide isotopic evidence of meteoric or mixing-zone waters and petrographic indicators of vadose conditions, typically at the top of the units. Evidence indicates that in Unit 5 the water table was mobile and Units 6a, 6b, 7 and 8, all characterized by ultraviolet fluorescent cements, are capped by sub-aerial erosion surfaces. Unit 9 (the Holocene) reflects the recent re-establishment of marine conditions. The extent of alteration of the entire sequence reflects the substantial and pervasive influence of meteoric waters. This effect is interpreted as a result of a greater rainfall and river flow from the mainland during early and late stages of interstadial periods. The study reflects progress in the ability to recognize the diagenetic signal generated by sea-level change. However, whereas the isotopic results reflect the changing relationships between vadose and phreatic zones in groundwater systems beneath successive emergent surfaces, their correspondence with petrographic features is expressed only weakly and commonly lacks the systematic sequential overprinting implied by the distribution of cathodoluminescent zones of cements in many ancient limestones.

AB  - The structural damages can lead to structural failure if they are not identified at early stages. Different methods for detecting and locating the damages in structures have been always appealing to designers in the field. Due to direct relation between the stiffness, natural frequency, and mode shapes in the structure, the modal parameters could be used for the purpose of detecting and locating the damages in structures. In the current study, a new damage indicator named "DLI' is proposed, using the mode shapes and their derivatives. A finite element model of a beam is used, and the numerical model is validated against experimental data. The proposed index is investigated for two beams with different support conditions and the results are compared with those of two well-known indices - MSEBI and CDF. To show the capability and accuracy of the proposed index, the damages with low severity at various locations of the structures containing the elements near the supports were investigated. The results under noisy conditions are investigated by considering 3% and 5% noise on modal data. The results show a high level of accuracy of the proposed index for identifying the location of the damaged elements in beams.

AB  - Soil columns were collected from a blueberry field, and insecticide solutions were allowed to leach through these columns. Insecticides from four different chemical classes were applied at two different rates: the concentration at which the insecticides wash off blueberries under rainfall conditions and the labeled field rate at which they are sprayed. The soil columns were divided into thirds; top, middle and bottom. Soil bioassays using Eisenia foetida Savigny, as an indicator species, were set up to determine the toxicity of the insecticides at a top, middle and bottom layer of the soil column. The mass of E. foetida was also measured after the bioassay experiment was completed. The concentrations at which insecticides wash-off of blueberries from rainfall were not lethal to E. foetida. In order to support mortality data, insecticide residues were quantified in the soil layers for each insecticide. Under field rate leaching conditions, carbaryl showed the high levels of toxicity in the top and middle layers of soil suggesting that it has the highest risk to organisms from leaching. This study will help blueberry growers make informed decisions about insecticide use, which can help minimize contamination of the environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The diachronic study from 1984 to 2009 of some vital attributes a dune ecosystem rehabilitated since 1982 by INRF at the dunes set in the dunes of Djelfa-Bousaada; shows that the number of perennial species, the higher the rehabilitation works. It was five perennial species in 1984 and 14 species in 2009. Sorensen index shows that the station after rehabilitation has a great diversity of which 10 annual species in 1984 and 35 species in 2009 with 8 families in 1984 and 15 families 2009. The index of Shannon & Weaver are 3.85 in 1984 and 4.15 in 2009, Simpson index reached 0.071 in 1984 and 0.066 in 2009. Finally Hill index was 0.29 in 1984 and 0.23 in 2009 which meant that the rehabilitation of the station is successful. The total recovery of the vegetation and the condition of the soil surface improves with the improved of physicochemical ecosystem conditions and therefore it is a good indicator of the effectiveness of rehabilitation. It is 21.59% of vegetation in 1984 and 51.18% in 2009 which reduces the surface silted up 67.9% in 1984 to 17% in 2009.

AB  - To evaluate the effect of phase change materials (PCMs) on the indoor thermal environment of greenhouses under different weather conditions and over a long time in the heating season, a study was carried out using both experimental method and numerical method. The study was conducted in a typical greenhouse located in Beijing, China, and important parameters have been monitored continuously for 61 days, including indoor air temperature, outdoor air temperature, solar radiation, surface temperature of greenhouse envelopes and soil temperature. Based on these parameters, a number of indicators, namely, operative temperature, daily effective accumulative temperature, irradiated surface temperature of the north wall, average temperature of PCMs, and daily heat storage and release, have been used to evaluate the performance of PCMs in greenhouses. All indicators have provided consistent results that confirm the positive effect of PCMs on improving the indoor thermal environment of greenhouses over a long time. Additionally, the paper has demonstrated that a sunny weather could help to promote the efficiency of PCMs, comparing to a cloudy weather. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although the direct combustion of biomass for energy that applies circulating fluidized bed (CFB) technology is steadily expanding worldwide, only few studies have conducted an environmental assessment of biomass ash thus far. Therefore, this study aims to integrate information on the environmental effects of biomass ash. We investigated the concentration of heavy metal in biomass ash samples (bottom ash, cyclone ash, and filter ash) derived from a CFB boiler that combusted agricultural and forest residues at a biomass power plant (2 x 12 MW) in China. Ash samples were gathered for the digestion and leaching test. The heavy metal content in the solution and the leachate was studied via an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer and a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 mercury analyzer. Measurements for the chemical composition, particle size distribution, and the surface morphology were carried out. Most of the metals in cyclone ash particles were enriched, whereas Ti and Hg were enriched in filter ash. Residence time contributed most to heavy metal enrichment. Under HJ/T 300 conditions, the heavy metals showed serious leaching characteristics. Under EN 12457-2 conditions, leaching behavior was hardly detected. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The trace element composition of the fish otolith is an indicator of biomineralization. In contrast to other skeletal tissue, the otolith retains its entire original structure and does not absorb any elements after the fish dies. Because otoliths in carp degrade very slowly in the dead body, the information it provides on the environment is retained, even in fossil form. Here, we report our analysis of the trace elements in otoliths of carp and of the water in Donghu Lake and Longhupao Lake, Heilongjiang province, China, where the fish lived. The results revealed that the trace elements found in the carp otoliths were clearly correlated with those found in these water bodies. There were high concentrations of Au, Ba, K, Sr and Zn in both the water and otoliths; in contrast there were high levels of As, Na and Se in water, but low concentrations in otoliths. These results indicate that an analysis of the otoliths of carps provides an accurate procedure for studying the surrounding hydrochemistry conditions. The interaction of the elements during deposition was also studied. The correlation coefficients of 13 trace elements identified in the otoliths in both lakes were calculated.

AB  - Changes in climate and atmospheric deposition of base cations can alter the ionic composition of soil and surface waters, and therefore affect the structure and function of sensitive ecosystems. However, these drivers are not generally explicitly considered in the calculation of critical loads or dynamic critical loads to evaluate the recovery of ecosystems from elevated acidic deposition. Here we explore the importance of accounting for these changes in calculating dynamic critical loads for ecosystems. We developed three-dimensional dynamic critical load surfaces as a function of nitrate, sulfur, and base cation deposition under current and future climate change scenarios for the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest New Hampshire. This case study indicates that dynamic critical loads for nitrate and sulfur will be lower under conditions of potential cl mate change or decreases in base cation deposition. This analysis suggests that greater emission controls may be needed to protect sensitive forest ecosystems from acidic deposition under a future climate change or conditions of lower atmospheric deposition of base cations, particularly for watersheds experiencing elevated leaching losses of nitrate. This study should facilitate more informed policy decisions on emission control strategies and assessments of ecosystem recovery.

AB  - The osmoregulatory response of Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis, Kaup 1858) to 14-day exposure and throughout 17-day exposure to different environmental salinities was investigated. A linear relationship was observed between environmental salinity and gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity whereas kidney Na+,K+-ATPase activity was unaffected. Two osmoregulatory periods could be distinguished according to variations in plasma osmolality: an adjustment period and a chronic regulatory period. No major changes in plasma osmolality and ions levels were registered at the end of the 14- to 17-day exposure period, indicating an efficient adaptation of the osmoregulatory system. Plasma levels of glucose and lactate were elevated in hypersaline water, indicating the importance of these energy substrates in these environments. Glucose was increased during hyper-osmoregulation but only in the adjustment period. Cortisol proved to be a good indicator of chronic stress and stress induced by transfer to the different osmotic conditions. This work shows that S. senegalensis is able to acclimate to different osmotic conditions during short-term exposure. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In yeast, environmental conditions control the transcription factor Msn2, the nuclear accumulation and function of which serve as a sensitive indicator of nutrient availablity and environmental stress load. We show here that the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of Msn2 is a direct target of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK). Genetic analysis suggests that Msn2-NLS function is inhibited by phosphorylation and activated by dephosphorylation. Msn2-NLS function is unaffected by many stress conditions that normally induce nuclear accumulation of full-length Msn2. The Msn2-NLS phosphorylation status is, however, highly sensitive to carbohydrate fluctuations during fermentative growth. Dephosphorylation occurs in >2 min after glucose withdrawal but the effect is reversed rapidly by refeeding with glucose. This response to glucose depletion is due to changes in cAPK activity rather than an increase in protein phosphatase activity. Surprisingly, the classical glucose-sensing systems are not connected to this rapid response system. Our results further imply that generic stress signals do not cause short-term depressions in cAPK activity. They operate on Msn2 by affecting an Msn5-dependent nuclear export and/or retention mechanism.

AB  - Recruitment of central/eastern Baltic cod critically depends on favourable oceanographic conditions in the deeper basins of the Baltic Sea creating a suitable habitat for the development of early life stages. The decline in the size of the spawning stock since the mid-1980s initiated a series of investigations on recruitment, which were continued through a partial recovery of the stock in the mid-1990s. The principal factors influencing recruitment and recognized at present are: (i) the volume of water with temperature, oxygen and salinity conditions which meet the minimum requirements for successful egg development ('reproductive volume'); (ii) the age-structure of the spawning stock; (iii) the timing of spawning; and (iv) predation mortality on eggs due to sprat (Sprattus sprattus) and herring (Clupea harengus), as well as cod cannibalism. We relate recruitment at age 2 to parent stock size using updated time series of these variables, comprising the period 1966 to 1994. Spawning stock biomass and egg production are compared as measures of parent stock size. The influence of wind energy and zooplankton abundance on cod recruitment are discussed. A modified Ricker model is outlined explicitly accounting for environmentally-induced oscillations around the two observed levels of cod stock size.

AB  - Lesser snow goose (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) goslings, approximately 5 weeks of age, were collected near the mouth of Tha-anne River, Northwest Territories, Canada, during mid-August 1991. Many dead goslings had been observed in the area from 1988 to 1990. Goslings from near the coast, where habitat degradation by grazing geese was severe, were smaller, weighed less, and had a greater prevalence of renal coccidiosis (Eimeria truncata) and cecal nematode (Trichostrongylus spp.) infection than did goslings from inland areas, where habitat destruction was not evident. Prevalence of infection with intestinal cestodes was greater at inland than at coastal sites. Prevalences of gizzard nematodes (Epomidiostomum spp.) and Leucocytozoon spp. were not significantly different at the two sites. Histological examination of kidneys and examination of kidney homogenates for oocysts were more sensitive methods than gross examination of the kidneys for detecting renal coccidial infection. The number of oocysts present in droppings was not a good indicator of the severity of renal coccidial infection in individual birds; however, the average number of oocysts in droppings was indicative of the average severity of infection among groups of goslings.

AB  - Meiobenthic and macrobenthic oligochaetes were collected from two depths in Lake Paijanne and examined together with environmental data in which two environmental gradients can be seen. Numbers of Piguetiella blanci, Aeolosoma quaternarium and Aeolosoma hemprichi were,positively correlated with oxygen saturation and negatively correlated with total phosphorus and COD suggesting that these species are indicators of oligotrophic conditions. Numbers of Amphichaeta leydigii, Specaria josinae and Vejdovskyella comata were positively correlated with total phosphorus which implies that these species prefer eutrophic conditions. The last three species and Dero digitata showed positive correlations with COD and organic sedimentation, which suggests that they also indicate organic loading. A decrease in aeolosomatid biomass was seen with increasing phosphorus and organic loading. The average body size of detritus-feeding naidids in the upper part of the profundal zone was reduced by organic loading, and more clearly eutrophication, which emphasizes the importance of including meiobenthic oligochaetes in pollution investigations. Of the naidid and aeolosomatid species, Chaetogaster langi preferred the greatest depths of the profundal zone while most of the other species were more abundant at 20 m rather than at the maximum depth. Clustering of the oligochaete taxa supported these observations and clustering of sampling stations based on oligochaete variables generally corresponded to clustering based on environmental data.

AB  - Peri-urban areas in Latin America exhibit significant social and environmental problems that affect the quality of life of their inhabitants. Based on previous studies, this paper aims to evaluate the quality of life in the peri-urban area of southern Mar del Plata, Argentine Republic, from a multimethod approach. A synthetic index was constructed based on the concept of habitability, which is directly linked to the notion of quality of life, and integrates six dimensions (health, housing, accessibility, education, economy, and environment). Indicators were obtained mainly from the last national censuses (2001-2010). Subsequently, semi-structured interviews (2015-2016) were conducted in the areas affected by the most critical habitability conditions identified by the index in order to deepen the perception and appreciation of the individuals' experience about their quality of life. The results obtained reveal unequal access to infrastructure, services, equipment, adequate housing, and urban land, among others, especially noticed between the coastal and inland sectors. The methodological procedure adopted allowed to complement and enlighten some objective and subjective aspects of the quality of life of peri-urban areas, providing the basis for the urban management of the study area.

AB  - The current level of technology development concerning technical, informational and organizational services in the field of the linear part of trunk pipeline technical condition diagnostics has significantly increased the control reliability and productivity [1].
   Thus, tens of thousands of defects, including those of an operational nature, are detected annually only via in-line inspection.
   Since the start of the oil and gas industry development, the oil transportation system has undergone many changes [2]. The main type was pipeline transport, the facilities of which ensure the transfer of more than 85% of the oil produced in Russia. Such indicators are conditioned by a number of reasons. Here are some of them: the relatively low cost of pumping, short and uninterrupted delivery of products, the ability to transport several types of oil products at the same time, and others. The main pipelines are designed so that oil from the fields passes to main consumers and refineries through the main intermediate consumption points, as well as commodity products are exported [3].
   The timely implementation of mandatory and recommended works will ensure the safety of the entire oil transportation system, and will also serve to develop the potential of this economic sector of the state. The system for oil, gas and oil product transportation is the combination of trunk pipelines.

AB  - Reconstruction of the history of past events becomes more objective when considering an increased number of possible indicators. Combining plant macrofossil analysis with pollen analysis has the potential to give a more detailed picture of the composition of the local vegetation. Patagonia has been the focus of several palaeoclimatic studies, in particular of latitudinal variations in southern westerly winds, which have global implications. However, palaeoecological reconstructions using plant macrofossils in conjunction with pollen analysis are still scarce. We analysed the plant macrofossils contained in two peat sequences from Peninsula Avellaneda (located in the Lago Argentino basin, southwest Patagonia) and integrate these results with pollen information. Plant macrofossils and pollen records provide a well-resolved history of vegetation and catchment conditions starting from ca. 13,000 cal yrs BP. We also investigated the development of plant communities following the retreat of glaciers, with emphasis on the expansion of Nothofagus species (which were restricted under glacial climates) and particular reference to Nothofagus pumilio. These results provide an example of how plant macrofossil analysis (taxonomic, taphonomic and statistical) in combination with pollen analysis results in a better understanding of postglacial environmental history.

AB  - Nowadays, mobile robots have become a useful tool that permits solving a wide range of applications. Their importance lies in their ability to move autonomously through unknown environments and to adapt to changing conditions. To this end, the robot must be able to build a model of the environment and to estimate its position using the information captured by the different sensors it may be equipped with. Omnidirectional vision sensors have become a robust option thanks to the richness of the data they capture. These data must be analysed to extract relevant information that permits estimating the position of the robot taking into account the number of degrees of freedom it has. In this work, several methods to estimate the relative height of a mobile robot are proposed and evaluated. The framework we present is based on the global appearance of the scenes, which has emerged as an efficient and robust alternative comparing to methods based on local features. All the algorithms have been tested with some sets of images captured under real working conditions in several indoor and outdoor spaces. The results prove that global appearance descriptors provide a feasible alternative to estimate topologically the relative altitude of the robot.

AB  - The demand for parrots for pet and scientific purposes is an increasing phenomenon. Yet, the cognitive complexity of these animals makes it difficult to fully satisfy their ecoethological needs in captivity, and strategies commonly adopted for their husbandry are often unsuccessful in guaranteeing their wellbeing. In this study, we investigated the effects of environmental restrictions on the behavioural repertoire of budgerigars, the most common parrot in captivity. Specifically, stereotypies and other behavioural indicators of stress were analyzed with respect to social and spatial housing conditions, that is, the number of individuals per housing unit and the size of the cages. In the first experiment, we compared the behavioural response of budgerigars Maintained in three different housing conditions and we observed that levels of stereotypic and non-stereotypic behaviours increased from mild to severe captive restrictions. We also found that this response varied between males and females. In the second experiment, we investigated the behavioural repertoire of budgerigars when rearranged in their housing units. We observed that some of the previously observed stereotypic behaviours were significantly reduced soon after individuals were allowed to interact with multiple social partners.

AB  - The aim of our study was to analyze the impact of soil agriculture management on bacterial abundance (expressed as total microorganism count plus copiotrophic and oligotrophic bacteria numbers) and soil dehydrogenase activity. Four different soil units agriculturally exploited (under oat-type crops) and the same number of control soils not agriculturally used were taken for study in April 2014 from the surface layer (0-20 cm). Under laboratory conditions the soils were subjected to analysis of: pH, total carbon, total microbial counts, copiotrophic and oligotrophic bacteria numbers, and dehydrogenase activity. The first consequences of agricultural practices were a decrease of pH toward acidic conditions and impoverishment of total carbon. Secondly, it was demonstrated that agricultural soil usage in relation to control sites affected biological properties by decreasing total microbial counts (by 20-75%), copio- and oligotrophic bacteria abundance (by 15-33%), and dehydrogenase activity (by 25-71). The ratio of oligotrophic to copiotrophic bacteria (O:C), being an indicator of soil biological balance, ranged 0.81-1.53 and 1.02-2.40 for arable and control soils, respectively. Lower values of biological factors observed in agricultural soils clearly indicated a progressive reduction of bacterial abundances and metabolic activities.

AB  - This work reports changes of Cr, Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg and Pb concentrations in the dissolved fraction, suspended particulate matter and immobilised Phaeodactylum tricornutum Bohlin (Bacillariophyceae), as well as of microalgae specific growth rates, during a 5-month period dredging operation in a contaminated area of the Tagus estuary, Portugal. Trace element concentrations showed broad variations in the dissolved fraction and suspended particulate matter, presumably reflecting rapid exchanges of redox-sensitive elements between water and particles, in conjunction with the dilution effect caused by the tidal excursion. Immobilised cells exposed to dredging environmental conditions showed significantly higher concentrations of Cr, Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg and Pb than under no dredging conditions. Concomitantly, specific cell growth was significantly lower, suggesting that elements released with dredging affect the microalgae physiology. The results obtained in this in situ work imply that the dissolved fraction and the suspended particulate matter are relatively ineffective indicators of the trace element enhancement during dredging and pointed out immobilised P. tricornutum as a reliable and efficient biomonitoring tool for the assessment of trace element remobilisation.

Keeping dairy cattle in nature reserves, without any fertilizer application and with rotational grazing-one of the many forms of organic grassland farming-was shown to be economically feasible: the dairy cattle produced 6000 kg milk animal(-1) year(-1). During an 11-year period the forage quality of the herbage-net energy value, digestible crude protein content and the potassium-and phosphate contents all remained sufficiently high. The Ellenberg indicator value for nitrogen soil fertility decreased slowly. The plant species composition changed from a Poa trivialis-Lolium perenne towards a Poa trivialis-Holcus lanatus community. Species of wet grassland communities such as Lychnis flos-cuculi, Caltha palustris and Carex aquatilis remained rare in ditches within the fields and did not spread into the fields. It became clear from the present study that cessation of fertilizer application alone, when starting from eutrophic soil conditions, is not sufficient to restore mesotrophic plant communities such as Calthion palustris and Junco-Molinion, but has the potential to restore plant communities of pastures such as Lolio-Potentillion and Cynosurion cristati.

AB  - Infant mortality is widely recognized as an indicator of poor living conditions. Scholars have identified economic, housing, environmental, and more recently, cultural determinants of infant mortality. Using individual-level data and record linkage this paper documents and explains the geography of infant mortality in Ottawa in 1901. Infant death in Ottawa mirrored the geography of poor living conditions in the city. The poorest and most densely settled community in Ottawa was Lowertown, a mostly French-Canadian part of the city with a disproportionate share of the city's infant deaths. In addition to environmental factors, infant mortality was linked to economic standing. Poorer families in Lowertown were more likely to have one of their infants die than better off families. After controlling for economic standing, however, cultural factors were stronger predictors of infant deaths. French-Canadian families in Lowertown had a greater risk of infant deaths than did families of other backgrounds irrespective of material circumstances. Supporting conclusions drawn elsewhere, this paper suggests that the interaction of particular cultural practices, such as shorter periods of breast-feeding among French-Canadians and a poor sanitary environment, resulted in high infant mortality rates in Ottawa.

AB  - Studies were conducted investigating bioenergetic responses of growing cattle to heat challenges using respiration rate as one of the primary measures. Respiration rare (RR) was measured using monitors designed from commercially available thin-film pressure sensors and a small battery powered micro-computer: The monitors were designed, fabricated and tested to provide continuous records as a basis for evaluating stress responses associated with environmental conditions. This article provides derails about the monitors and the suitability of obtained records as an indicator of stress, based on measures obtained in environmental chambers during constant and simulated hear wave conditions as well as a field study Representative data from two laboratory studies indicated an association of RR and ambient temperature (P < 0.01) with diurnal changes being evident in the cyclic test and step changes being evident in the constant ambient temperature tests. A two to three breaths per minute (BPM) rate of change of RR with respect to ambient temperature (degrees C) was observed for steers in the laboratory studies. The field study revealed a striking response of RR to the ambient temperature (6.6 BPM/degrees C rate of change)for a steer that had direct solar load (no-shade) compared to a 1.6 BPM/degrees C rate of change in the shade.

AB  - Until recently, accident indicators were analysed separately due to the methods employed, however, the joint use of neural networks and clustering techniques has proven to be an excellent tool for analysing how accidents occur. As such, the aim of this study was to use neural networks and cluster analysis on accident indicators involving tractors on federal highways in the southeast of Brazil. A total of 496 incidents were analysed between 2007 and 2016. The indicators for the accidents under evaluation were time, type of accident, cause of accident, weather conditions, condition of the victims, road layout and federated state. The use of neural networks was based on self-organising maps (SOM), hierarchical clustering employing dendrograms, and non-hierarchical clustering employing the k-means coefficient. Using these techniques, it was possible to divide the incidents into 18 accident groups, of which 11 were represented by the state of Minas Gerais, one group where casualties were predominant, and one group with fatalities. It proved possible to analyse the factors that led to the accident, together with its consequences. Machine traffic during periods of low natural light on straight roads caused rear-end collisions, with casualties and fatalities.

AB  - The appraisal of stress in plants is of great relevance in agriculture and any time the transport of living plants is involved. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are an optimal solution to simultaneously monitor a large number of plants in a mostly automatic way. A number of sensors are readily available to monitor indicators that are likely related to stress. The most common of them include the levels of total volatile compounds and CO2 together with common physical parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, and illumination, which are known to affect plants' behavior. Recent progress in microsensors and communication technologies, such as the LoRa protocol, makes it possible to design sensor nodes of high sensitivity where power consumption, transmitting distances, and costs are optimized. In this paper, the design of a WSN dedicated to plant stress monitoring is described. The nodes have been tested on European privet (Ligustrum Jonandrum) kept in completely different conditions in order to induce opposite level of stress. The results confirmed the relationship between the release of total Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and the environmental conditions. A machine learning model based on recursive neural networks demonstrates that total VOCs can be estimated from the measure of the environmental parameters.

AB  - Electrical insulation materials play a key role in stable and uninterrupted operation of electrical power system. Researchers working in the field of electrical insulation have turned their focus to nano composite insulation materials for better performance and reliability. A typical nano composite insulation material is a combination of nano particles and base materials. Since last 25 years silicon rubber and epoxy are two widely used electrical insulation materials for outdoor and indoor applications respectively. To further enhance the electrical insulation performance of these materials addition of nano particles has proven to be of practical value. This study presents an investigation on zepoxy (a military grade epoxy) incorporated with three different nano particles at varying percentages. The main aim was to find the nature of relationship between leakage current (LC) and partial discharge (PD). In addition to that optimum composition which results in lowest values of PD and LC was also investigated for each of three nano composites. The results of this study help to understand the interdependence between LC and PD for indoor electrical insulation based on zepoxy. LC and PD play a vital role in condition assessment of any insulation material.

AB  - OAS1 (2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase) is a type I interferon molecule which is responsible for antiviral activity and known for its action in innate immunity. It was also reported to be stimulated by the release of interferon tau (IFN-t) in the serum of pregnant animals during conceptus implantation. OAS1 is studied in most of the ruminants except for buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), which is well known for high milk production. Therefore, in the present study OAS1 mRNA was isolated from pregnant buffalo (B. bubalis) at 18-21 day of pregnancy. The ORF region of OAS1 was amplified and sequenced for characterization of this protein. In silico analysis of protein was done in order to find the suitability of protein as a candidate molecule for early pregnancy diagnostic kits. The functional characterization identifies various motifs present in the protein which are responsible for its interaction with other proteins. Physiochemical properties predict the protein nature during in vitro conditions. Further, immunogenic studies revealed OAS1 is highly antigenic nature and its suitability for use in vivo conditions. In conclusion, OAS1 protein expression in buffalo is a good indicator of conceptus implantation and has suitable properties for being used in early and precise pregnancy diagnostic kits.

AB  - Development of refined indices of female reproductive potential is needed for estimation of alternative biological reference points for the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) fishery, which is managed with large male-only harvest regulations. Females were collected from 2007 to 2009 to investigate seasonal and interannual variation in fecundity with maternal size, shell condition (a proxy for age after maturity), and recent mating and again in 2010 to examine biochemical measures (carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen) of embryo quality. Mean model-adjusted fecundity was highest for primiparous and young multiparous females and declined with advancing shell condition, presumably from senescence. This pattern was also found for clutch fullness indices evaluated from 20 years of stock assessment survey data. Indicators of low female sperm reserves were associated with decreased (similar to 10%) fecundity for multiparous females. Seasonal comparison of size-fecundity relationships suggested that embryo loss during brooding was minimal, and embryo quality analyses suggested that strong variation with maternal characteristics was unlikely. Finally, fecundity-at-size of EBS females may be lower than that of conspecifics in Japan and eastern Canada.

AB  - The composition of freshwater fish populations is closely linked to the environmental conditions. Between 1952-1962 the environmental conditions in the Danube river were highly affected by direct and indirect anthropogenic activities. In 2005-2008 the human impact on fish populations was diminished. The analysis of freshwater fish characteristics relies on recorded catch that lay at the basis of six indicators describing the status of the freshwater fish community. We analysed the following indicators of freshwater fish community: (1) the total annual catch of fish species (t/year); (2) the total number of fish species caught by industrial fishing, fishery statistics (number of species/year); (3) the number of valuable fish species (relative biomass RB>1%) annual catch (number of species/year); (4) the number of ruling fish species (RB>10%) annual catch (number of species/year); (5) the annual relative biomass of feeding groups (% planktivorous species/year, % benthivorous species/year, % top carnivorous species/year, % eurytroph species/year); (6) the annual relative biomass of reproductive groups (% semi-migratory species/year; % rheophilic species/year, % limnic species/year). This analysis highlights that in 2005-2008 the fish community structure come out to be in a rebalancing process.

AB  - The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) contains the most variable genes in vertebrates, but despite extensive research, the mechanisms maintaining this polymorphism are still unresolved. One hypothesis is that MHC polymorphism is a result of balancing selection operating by overdominance, but convincing evidence for overdominant selection in natural populations has been lacking. We present strong evidence consistent with MHC-specific overdominance in a free-living population of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) in northernmost Europe. In this population, where just two MHC alleles were observed, MHC heterozygous fish had a lower parasite load, were in better condition (as estimated by a fatness indicator) and had higher survival under stress than either of the homozygotes. Conversely, there was no consistent association between these fitness measures and assumedly neutral microsatellite variability, indicating an MHC-specific effect. Our results provide convincing empirical evidence consistent with the notion that overdominance can be an important evolutionary mechanism contributing to MHC polymorphism in wild animal populations. They also support a recent simulation study indicating that the number of alleles expected to be maintained at an MHC loci can be low, even under strong heterozygote advantage.

AB  - The possibility of using old age of a mate as an indicator of genetic quality is currently controversial. Early verbal models as well as a recent simulation study noted that female choice for old males is beneficial because longevity indicates viability in the current environment. In contrast, a quantitative genetic model of the relationship between age and breeding value of fitness casts strong doubts on the mechanism. The present analysis shows, however, that these doubts are mainly the result of assuming that all variation among individuals arises from differences in allocation between components of fitness. This neglects the possibility of variability in condition as a whole. Instead, when allowing for persistent variability in condition and assuming optimal reaction norms in allocation, it is shown that correlations between survival and genetic quality or fitness can easily be established at all ages. On the other hand, the results also suggest that the validity of verbal arguments is limited, and counterexamples can be generated where low-quality individuals should invest more in survival. Therefore, resolution of the old age indicator problem requires specification of the constraints acting on life-history characteristics.

AB  - Vertical mixing of the nocturnal stable boundary layer (SBL) over a complex land surface is investigated for a range of stabilities, using a decoupling index () based on the 2-50 m bulk gradient of the ubiquitous natural trace gas radon-222. The relationship between and the bulk Richardson number () exhibits three broad regions: (1) a well-mixed region () in weakly stable conditions (); (2) a steeply increasing region () for "transitional" stabilities (); and (3) a decoupled region (-1.0) in very stable conditions (). exhibits a large variability within individual bins, however, due to a range of competing processes influencing bulk mixing under different conditions. To explore these processes in - space, we perform a bivariate analysis of the bulk thermodynamic gradients, various indicators of external influences, and key turbulence quantities at 10 and 50 m. Strong and consistent patterns are found, and five distinct regions in - space are identified and associated with archetypal stable boundary-layer regimes. Results demonstrate that the introduction of a scalar decoupling index yields valuable information about turbulent mixing in the SBL that cannot be gained directly from a single bulk thermodynamic stability parameter. A significant part of the high variability observed in turbulence statistics during very stable conditions is attributable to changes in the degree of decoupling of the SBL from the residual layer above. When examined in - space, it is seen that very different turbulence regimes can occur for the same value of , depending on the particular combination of values for the bulk temperature gradient and wind shear, together with external factors. Extremely low turbulent variances and fluxes are found at 50 m height when and (fully decoupled). These "quiescent" cases tend to occur when geostrophic forcing is very weak and subsidence is present, but are not associated with the largest bulk temperature gradients. Humidity and net radiation data indicate the presence of low cloud, patchy fog or dew, any of which may aid decoupling in these cases by preventing temperature gradients from increasing sufficiently to favour gravity wave activity. The largest temperature gradients in our dataset are actually associated with smaller values of the decoupling index (), indicating the presence of mixing. Strong evidence is seen from enhanced turbulence levels, fluxes and submeso activity at 50 m, as well as high temperature variances and heat flux intermittencies at 10 m, suggesting this region of the - distribution can be identified as a top-down mixing regime. This may indicate an important role for gravity waves and other wave-like phenomena in providing the energy required for sporadic mixing at this complex terrain site.

AB  - Orchid species are critically dependent on mycorrhizal fungi for completion of their life cycle, particularly during the early stages of their development when nutritional resources are scarce. As such, orchid mycorrhizal fungi play an important role in the population dynamics, abundance, and spatial distribution of orchid species. However, less is known about the ecology and distribution of orchid mycorrhizal fungi. In this study, we used 454 amplicon pyrosequencing to investigate ecological and geographic variation in mycorrhizal associations in fourteen species of the orchid genus Dactylorhiza. More specifically, we tested the hypothesis that variation in orchid mycorrhizal communities resulted primarily from differences in habitat conditions where the species were growing. The results showed that all investigated Dactylorhiza species associated with a large number of fungal OTUs, the majority belonging to the Tulasnellaceae, Ceratobasidiaceae and Sebacinales. Mycorrhizal specificity was low, but significant variation in mycorrhizal community composition was observed between species inhabiting different ecological habitats. Although several fungi had a broad geographic distribution, Species Indicator Analysis revealed some fungi that were characteristic for specific habitats. Overall, these results indicate that orchid mycorrhizal fungi may have a broad geographic distribution, but that their occurrence is bounded by specific habitat conditions.

AB  - Several C-1-C-4 alkylammonium hydrosulfates [R3NH][HSO4] have been conveniently prepared from the cheap raw materials sulfuric acid and alkylamines. Their acidities were measured by chemical titration and determined using UV-vis spectroscopy with a basic indicator 4-nitroaniline. The catalytic performance of these hydrosulfates for the condensation of phenol with formaldehyde to bisphenol F (BPF) was evaluated in detail on a batch reactor. The results indicated that the proposed catalysts are very active for such condensation due to its homogeneous catalysis characteristics in reaction conditions. Among the catalysts examined, [H3NCH2CH2NH3][HSO4](2) shows the best catalytic performance and it can achieve a complete conversion of formaldehyde, providing a higher than 90% selectivity for BPF under the optimal conditions. Furthermore, the catalyst can be recovered from the reaction mixture via an azeotropic distillation with cyclohexane to remove water and then filtration and used repeatedly six times almost without loss of activity, showing an excellent reusability. It is suggested that the present catalytic process combines the characteristics of a homogenized reaction and heterogenized recovery so might provide a highly-efficient, environmentally-friendly and low-cost route for synthesis of bisphenol F.

AB  - Soil concentrations of 12 heavy metals that have been linked to various anthropogenic activities were measured in samples collected from the uppermost horizon in approximately 1000 wetlands across the conterminous US as part of the 2011 National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA). The heavy metals were silver (Ag), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), antimony (Sb), tin (Sn), vanadium (V), tungsten (W), and zinc (Zn). Using thresholds to distinguish natural background concentrations from human-mediated additions, we evaluated wetland soil heavy metal concentrations in the conterminous US and four regions using a Heavy Metal Index (HMI) that reflects human-mediated heavy metal loads based on the number of elements above expected background concentration. We also examined the individual elements to detect concentrations of heavy metals above expected background that frequently occur in wetland soils. Our data show that wetland soils of the conterminous US typically have low heavy metal loads, and that most of the measured elements occur nationally in concentrations below thresholds that relate to anthropogenic activities. However, we found that soil lead is more common in wetland soils than other measured elements, occurring nationally in 11.3% of the wetland area in concentrations above expected natural background (>35ppm). Our data show positive relationships between soil lead concentration and four individual landscape metrics: road density, percent impervious surface, housing unit density, and population density in a 1-km radius buffer area surrounding a site. These relationships, while evident on a national level, are strongest in the eastern US, where the highest road densities and greatest population densities occur. Because lead can be strongly bound to wetland soils in particular, maintenance of the good condition of our nation's wetlands is likely to minimize risk of lead mobilization.

AB  - A new Coastal Rapid Environmental Assessment (CREA) methodology, based on an operational regional forecasting system and coastal monitoring networks of opportunity, has been developed and successfully applied to the Northern Adriatic Sea. The methodology aims at improving the initial condition estimates by combining operational coarse model fields with coastal observations to improve medium to short range predictability which is required by coastal zone and emergency management. The CREA modeling framework system consists of a high resolution, 0(800 m), Adriatic SHELF model (ASHELF) nested into the Adriatic Forecasting System (AFS) at 2.2 km resolution. The CREA observational system is composed of coastal networks sampling the water column temperature and salinity between depths of 5 and 40 m.
   The initialization technique blends the AFS fields with the available observations using a multi-input, multi-scale optimal interpolation technique and a spin-up period for the high resolution ASHELF model to dynamically adjust initial conditions from the coarser resolution AFS model. The high resolution spin up period has been investigated through a dedicated set of experiments and it was found that a week time is enough to have new energetic features in the model initial condition field estimates to be blended with observations.
   Five CREA study cases have been analyzed for different months of the year, one per month from May to September 2003, chosen on the basis of the availability of the coastal observations for both model initialization and validation. The CREA 7-days forecasts show skill improvements in the coastal area salinity and temperature profiles, deriving from the blending and the spin-up period in the initialization methodology. The main conclusion is that forecasting in coastal areas by nesting necessitates of the observations to correct the coarse resolution model fields providing informations where parent and child model topographies mismatch. Results demonstrate the feasibility of a CREA strategy to support coastal zone management in line with recent operational oceanography developments. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The relevance of the study is determined by the processes of modernization of vocational education and the transition to the educational standards of the third generation, which open up new opportunities for students and teachers. Step-by-step management support of professional and educational trajectory of students requires organizational conditions and the development of technology for its practical implementation. Identifying the level of motivation in students when choosing a future profession allows assessing the level of inclusion of students in educational and cognitive activities and determining how far it is from the optimal motivational level, which allows the student achieving their goals, advancing in professional and personal development. At the initial stage of diagnosis, the analysis of professional experience of students, successes and problems in the training practice of the first year of training is carried out, at the next stage, the results of research activities on the results of the second year of training are analyzed. Activity-practical criterion, indicators of which are formed professional skills, primary professional experience, being in a sense the total overall performance indicator of professional and personal development of students, also changes qualitatively in the direction of improvement.

AB  - Raman spectroscopy differentiation of carotenoids has traditionally been based on the nu (1) position (C = C stretching vibrations in the polyene chain) in the 1500-1600 cm(-1) range, using a 785 nm excitation laser. However, when the number of conjugated double bonds is similar, as in the cases of zeaxanthin and beta-carotene, this distinction is still ambiguous due to the closeness of the Raman bands. This work shows the Raman results, obtained in resonance conditions using a 514 mm laser, on Lecanora campestris and Lecanora atra species, which can be used to differentiate and consequently characterize carotenoids. The presence of the carotenoid found in Lecanoraceae lichens has been demonstrated to depend on the atmospheric pollution level of the environment they inhabit. Astaxanthin, a superb antioxidant, appears as the principal xanthophyll in highly polluted sites, usually together with the UV screening pigment scytonemin; zeaxanthin is the major carotenoid in medium polluted environments, while beta-carotene is the major carotenoid in cleaner environments. Based on these observations, an indirect classification of the stress suffered in a given environment can be assessed by simply analysing the carotenoid content in the Lecanoraceae lichens by using resonance Raman imaging.

AB  - Many advancements have been introduced to tackle spatial and temporal structures in data. When the spatial and/or temporal domains are relatively large, assumptions must be made to account for the sheer size of the data. The large data size, coupled with realities that come with observational data, make it difficult for all of these assumptions to be met. In particular, air quality data are very sparse across geographic space and time, due to a limited air pollution monitoring network. These "missing" values make it difficult to incorporate most dimension reduction techniques developed for high-dimensional spatiotemporal data. This article examines aerosol optical depth (AOD), an indirect measure of radiative forcing, and air quality. The spatiotemporal distribution of AOD can be influenced by both natural (e.g., meteorological conditions) and anthropogenic factors (e.g., emission from industries and transport). After accounting for natural factors influencing AOD, we examine the spatiotemporal relationship in the remaining human influenced portion of AOD. The presented data cover a portion of India surrounding New Delhi from 2000-2006. The proposed method is demonstrated showing how it can handle the large spatiotemporal structure containing so much missing data for both meteorologic conditions and AOD over time and space.

AB  - A comparative analysis of the habitats of seven nymphaeid associations: Potamogetonetum natantis, Polygonetum natantis, Nuphar-Nymphaeetum albae, Nymphaeetum candidae, Nupharetum pumilae, Trapetum natantis and Nymphoidetum peltatae, was made within Poland. On the basis of water and substrate properties in the phytocoenoses analysed, it was demonstrated that most nymphaeid associations in Poland are distinctly associated with specific habitat conditions. Trapetum natantis occurs in neutral waters, poor in NH4+, but markedly rich in dissolved organic matter, K+, PO43-, total Fe and Ca2+. It develops best on slightly acidic mineral substrates poor in Ca2+ and Na+, but markedly rich in PO43- and NO3. Nymphoidetum peltatae occurs in alkaline waters with high concentrations of Na+, Cl- and NO3- and with relatively high concentrations of K+ and PO43-. Its substrates are mineral, poor in SO42- and total N and rich in NO3-, PO43- and K+. Nupharetum pumilae develops in waters extremely poor in SO42-, Na+, K+ and Ca2+, but rich in NO3- and dissolved organic matter. It mainly occurs on organic substrates poor in Ca2+ and Na+. Nymphaeetum candidae and Potamogetonetum natantis are mainly found in mesotrophic waters. Polygonetum natantis mainly inhabits mineral substrates poor in NO3-, Na+ and dissolved SiO2.

AB  - The animal's mental state (i.e., well-being, pain, suffering) is not directly accessible through scientific methods. These feelings can only be indirectly assessed through indicators (for example through a characteristic expression of pain related behaviour). Those indicators are based on parameters related to behaviour, health, physiology, performance, body condition and hygiene. Combinations of different parameters from different disciplines might increase the interpretation of results. The specific housing environment influences the performance (i.e., growth, milk production and reproductive performance), although performance is mostly influenced by management. Conclusions based on direct relationships between animal welfare and performance are rather difficuft to make. Choice experiments may provide information of the relative preference of the animal for specific housing conditions. As an example for increasing cow comfort, dairy cows demonstrate their preference for elastic surfaces (mattresses) for their resting behaviour compared to conventional hard rubber surfaces. This modification of the cubicles leads to extended resting periods and lying postures that may influence the blood flow and milk production of the mammary gland. A direct proof for the relationship between increased milk production and this measure for cow comfort has not yet been made. Assuming that this measure will enhance the profitability by increasing milk production, the extra investment for the improvement of lying comfort would be justified.

AB  - Zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, were exposed to four directly acting reference clastogens (mitomycin C, bleomycin, dimethylarsinic acid and potassium chromate) under laboratory conditions. The aim was to examine the inducibility of micronuclei (MN) in haemocytes and gill cells. Positive responses were observed in both tissues for all four substances used under the given test conditions. The mean MN frequencies in treated mussels ranged between 3.2 and 6.9 parts per thousand in haemocytes and between 5.4 and 6.7 parts per thousand in gill cells. The spontaneous MN levels averaged 1.2 and 2.8 parts per thousand in haemocytes and gill cells, respectively. The MN induction capacity of the different chemicals was equivalent in both tissues, except for the treatment with dimethylarsinic acid which generated st significantly higher MN rate in gill cells than in haemocytes. Several characteristics suggest that haemolymph is the more appropriate test tissue for environmental genotoxicity assessment: (1) a shorter preparation time of slides, (2) a more accurate identification of unambiguous MN, (3) a lower baseline MN frequency and a higher induction factor.

AB  - Engaging in socially embedded actions such as imitation and interpersonal synchrony facilitates relationships with peers and caregivers. Imitation and interpersonal synchrony impairments of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) might contribute to their difficulties in connecting and learning from others. Previous fMRI studies investigated cortical activation in children with ASD during finger/hand movement imitation; however, we do not know whether these findings generalize to naturalistic face-to-face imitation/interpersonal synchrony tasks. Using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), the current study assessed the cortical activation of children with and without ASD during a face-to-face interpersonal synchrony task. Fourteen children with ASD and 17 typically developing (TD) children completed three conditions: a) Watch-observed an adult clean up blocks; b) Do-cleaned up the blocks on their own; and c) Together-synchronized their block clean up actions to that of an adult. Children with ASD showed lower spatial and temporal synchrony accuracies but intact motor accuracy during the Together/interpersonal synchrony condition. In terms of cortical activation, children with ASD had hypoactivation in the middle and inferior frontal gyri (MIFG) as well as middle and superior temporal gyri (MSTG) while showing hyperactivation in the inferior parietal cortices/lobule (IPL) compared to the TD children. During the Together condition, the TD children showed bilaterally symmetrical activation whereas children with ASD showed more left-lateralized activation over MIFG and right-lateralized activation over MSTG. Additionally, using ADOS scores, in children with ASD greater social affect impairment was associated with lower activation in the left MIFG and more repetitive behavior impairment was associated with greater activation over bilateral MSTG. In children with ASD better communication performance on the VABS was associated with greater MIFG and/or MSTG activation. We identified objective neural biomarkers that could be utilized as outcome predictors or treatment response indicators in future intervention studies.

AB  - The long-range, migratory eastern relict population of Northern Bald Ibis Geronticus eremita has been steadily declining since the time of discovery in 2002, despite the protection programme in place at the breeding grounds in Syria. Assessing the ecological conditions and threats along the migration route and at the wintering site, both discovered in 2006, has become a priority for this Critically Endangered species. Adult ibises spent the winter at the same site on the central Ethiopian highland plateau, from August until mid-February during five consecutive winters (2006-2011). The wintering site was surveyed during four field visits and assessed through a spatial analysis of 1,067 satellite locations. The site is in an agro-pastoral landscape, inhabited by a settled community of people living in relatively poor and isolated conditions. Home range analysis based on kernel distributions showed that the bald ibises used a core range area of 9.1-19.0 km(2) (confirmed by direct visual observations in the field) and an extended range area of 61.0-126.1 km(2). These figures are c.20 and 60 times smaller, respectively, than those calculated for the breeding site in Syria. Eighty-one percent of the core area in Ethiopia was used in all five years confirming the birds' fidelity to this wintering site. Ibises preferred to forage in wet or dry pastures and in recently cut hayfields, and avoided tall grass, uncut hayfields and cultivation. Despite dependence on human-created habitats, human disturbance observed in the field was minimal. The main short-term threat for the ibises was judged to be the potential raising of attention on the part of the local community specifically towards these few individual ibises. In the medium term, the main threat comes from the conversion of pastures into crops and the potential use of fertilisers and pesticides.

AB  - We have measured stable isotopic compositions of Miocene pelagic fine-fraction (< 63 mum) carbonates from oligotrophic deep-sea sites in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and compared them with those of coexisting foraminifers to test their utility as near sea-surface indicators. Fine-fraction carbonates (primarily polyspecific nannofossils) and surface-dwelling planktic foraminiferal (Globigerinoides) stable isotopes both have been considered to reflect surface-water hydrographic conditions. However, our results indicate that fine-fraction stable isotopes are offset from and do not correlate well with those of Globigerinoides. In contrast, stable isotopic records of the deep-dwelling planktic foraminifer Globoquadrina are in good correspondence with the fine-fraction records in terms of long-term (ca. > 1 m.y.) trends and temporal variability. On the basis of a time-series hydrography and flux study site in the oligotrophic subtropical North Atlantic, we interpret the isotopic discrepancies between fine-fraction and Globigerinoides as resulting primarily from season of calcification, as well as possible vital effects. We suggest that fine-fraction stable isotope values from oligotrophic waters reflect late winter-early spring relatively cool, nutrient-rich shallow mixed-layer conditions during the time of deep mixing (i.e., spring bloom), whereas Globigerinoides stable isotope values record conditions that prevailed in the stratified surface waters in the warmer late spring-fall. This implies that paired analyses of fine-fraction and surface-dwelling planktic foraminiferal delta(18)O could be applied to reconstruct paleoseasonality of the open oceans. However, because the fine-fraction delta(13)C values are not representative of the annual mean surface-water delta(13)C, we recommend use of near surface-dwelling planktic foraminiferal delta(13)C as a proxy for delta(13)C of stratified surface waters that are more or less in equilibrium with the atmosphere with respect to pCO(2).

AB  - Salinity of irrigation water is one of the main environmental constraints limiting the geographical distribution of several species. In order to understand and to cope with critical environmental constraint, a pot experiment was undertaken to investigate the potential effect of irrigation with various natural saline waters gathered from arid and semiarid regions; on rooting of stem cuttings, growth and on the physiological responses of Mascarene grass (Zoysia tenuifolia Willd.). The obtained results indicate that rooting of stem cuttings was successfully established even under a relatively high salinity. Moreover, growth under saline conditions was not inhibited as indicated by the no significant effect of the various treatments applied neither on aerial nor on root dry weights. Although the continued irrigation of Zoysia plantlets with saline waters, the photochemical efficiency of PSII and the Na+ and K+ uptake were not altered. Platelets kept almost a K+/Na+ ratio > 1. Results suggest that Zoysia tolerate the various applied treatments which will ease their agro management and optimize their production in arid and semi arid regions.

KW  - BEHAVIOR
KW  - DYNAMICS
AB  - Social Networks Ecosystem is evolving faster and Social Networks users' intensive activities are affecting significantly the network traffic. Generated data from different sending and receiving hosts have to be handled by network active nodes and links. In this paper, we propose to study the interaction between two types of network active hosts by using a Lotka-Volterra competitive system that considers the subnet limiting supply. We applied our proposed model to two kinds of Online Social Networks' (OSNs') users characterized by the intensity of their activities from the generated data perspective. We assumed and proved that the impact of competition is flexible and subject to forwarding protocol and subnet allocated resources. By taking the competition case in the analysis of the differential equations, we show that when competition exists, one stable equilibrium point can be found if certain conditions are respected. Numerical results confirm our theoretical analysis and show that instead of treating equally at the subnet level all data from active hosts, adopting a routing protocol that takes into account the nature of data and the forwarding time is necessary for improving the overall performance of the network.

AB  - The systematic survey of grassland communities was performed on Mt. Stol (eastern Serbia). The main aims of the research were to: (1) determine grassland vegetation types of the researched area; (2) correlate the impacts of the soil and environmental conditions on the occurrence of certain plant communities, and (3) comment on the conservational value of the grasslands in the researched area. The data set included 60 phytosociological releves of grasslands recorded between 2001 and 2004. The main environmental gradients of species composition were analyzed by Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA). For the ecological interpretation of ordination axes, ecological indicator values were used. Three associations were distinguished: Danthonietum calycinae, Asperulo-Agrostietum vulgaris and Ranunculo bulbosi-Arrhenatheretum elatioris belonging to two alliances and two classes: Chrysopogono-Danthonion - Festuco-Brometea and Arrhenatherion - Molinio-Arrhenatheretea. The results of the DCA support our assumption that the main environmental gradient in the species composition of the grasslands is related to nutrients and moisture. The conservational value of grasslands in the researched area is discussed.

AB  - In molecular oncology the analysis of growth patterns of cells represent a major goal for understanding the evolution of growth profiles in pathological conditions. To compare various experimental settings in a pre-clinical study of inhibitors of prostate cancer, we modeled cancer cell growth using different statistical approaches which account for biological variability and complexity within experiments and over time. We first estimated cell growth by means of Linear Mixed Effects models that included unobserved factors that may influence cell development. Random effects were included to allow for no constant variance and covariance of residuals over time (Wu and West, 2009) and to properly model the whole growth process (i.e., all observation times). These are crucial aspects that are commonly ignored by the standard Linear Model. Since the nature of the data does not support the assumption of strictly linear effect of the continuous covariates on the predictor we present a solution within generalized additive models with mixed effects. An extension of this modeling to a fully Bayesian framework is also considered as it has a high degree of flexibility.

However, groundwater habitats and communities occur at different spatial scales to those at which aquifers are managed, making their inclusion in policy decisions difficult. A system of classifying groundwater ecosystems is needed to aid this, yet such a typology is currently not available. Here, a hierarchical model for a typology of groundwater habitats is suggested, which considers three spatial scales: macro, meso, and local. On a macroscale, communities are influenced by biogeographic characteristics; at a mesoscale they are influenced by the hydrogeological type of the aquifer; and on local scale by the hydrological exchange with surface water and hence the oxygen and nutrient supply. Consequently, groundwater habitats are assumed to be defined by biogeographic particularities, the hydrogeological aquifer type and by localized hydrological exchange with surface water. By adopting a `groundwater habitat typology', groundwater biologists may be able to work with hydrogeologists to assist in the sustainable management of groundwater by predicting groundwater biodiversity and the distribution of important or endangered species. The typology proposed here is a first step towards achieving this goal.

AB  - Plants act as a sink for air pollutants and can be used as a bioindicator for monitoring pollution load in different areas.  In the present study air pollution tolerance index (APTI) of plant species growing in the field conditions were determined by using levels of total chlorophyll, ascorbic acid, leaf extract, pH and relative water content.  To identify plant parameters and plant species suitable for bioindication purpose, selected plants were exposed to 0.15 ppm SO2 in dynamic exposure chambers for 2h daily for 30 days.  Different physiological, biochemical and growth parameters were measured in plants for their biomonitoring potential.  It is found that M. Sativa, V. faba, V. sineusis, M. indica and E. hybrid plants can be used as indicator species in SO2 polluted area and P. guajava and C. arietinum may be used as bioaccumulator of gaseous SO2 in the environment.  Further the field studies conducted around Shaktinagar thermal power plant showed that E. hybrid may be a reliable bioaccumulator of S and M. indica may be conveniently used for bioindication and also its a good bioaccumulator.  Lastly, the usefullness of the floristic composition as an indicator to the level of air pollution was suggested.

AB  - The gerbillid Myocricetodon is mainly known from the Miocene of Africa and Asia, but some small samples of this genus have been identified in southwestern Europe, interpreted as immigrants driven by the Messinian Salinity Crisis. However, the specific determination of these European populations and their relationships with African forms have proved controversial. The population from Negratin-1 (Guadix Basin, southern Spain) was attributed to the African species Myocricetodon jaegeri, but other European samples have still not been determined at the specific level. Here we describe the material of Myocricetodon from Almenara-M (eastern Spain), which represents the most abundant sample of the genus known from Europe, confirming its assignation to M. jaegeri. We also analyze material from Salobrefia, Pino Mojon (southern Spain) and Castelnou-3 (southern France), concluding that these samples belong to the same species. The presence of these coeval and conspecific populations of Myocricetodon is explained by a single migratory event from northern Africa. The occurrence of Myocricetodon, interpreted as an indicator of warm and arid conditions, is restricted to southern and eastern Spain and the southeastermost extreme of France, being mainly limited to the Mediterranean coast. It is absent in other Iberian areas, such as the Granada, Gabriel and Teruel basins, despite their rich and well-studied record of late Miocene mammals. This distribution suggests the existence of different environmental (more humid) conditions in those areas during the latest Miocene, as already proposed for the Granada Basin. Our data also indicate that the presence of Myocricetodon in Europe was limited to a short interval close to the Miocene-Pliocene boundary, contrarily to other gerbils, namely Debruijnimys, which persisted during the Pliocene. This suggests that Myocricetodon could be extremely sensitive to environmental factors and its occurrence in Europe was linked to a specific moment of arid conditions.

AB  - The way energy resources are used under variable environmental conditions lies at the heart of our understanding of resource management and opportunism in many organisms. Here we sought to determine how a time-limited, synovigenic and polyphagous insect with a high reproductive-potential (Anastrepha ludens), copes behaviourally and metabolically with environmental unpredictability represented by constant and variable regimes of host availability and variation in food quality. We hypothesized that an adaptive response to a windfall of nutritious food would be the rapid accumulation of energy metabolites (whole body lipids, glycogen and proteins) in the female. We also studied patterns of oogenesis as an indicator of egg-reabsorption under stressful environmental conditions. As predicted, patterns of energy metabolites were mainly driven by the quality and temporal pattern of food availability. In contrast, patterns of host availability had a lower impact upon metabolites. When given constant access to high quality nutrients, after an initial increase early in life, whole body lipids and glycogen were regulated downward to a steady-state level and somatic protein levels did not vary. In contrast, when food uncertainty was introduced, whole body lipid, glycogen and protein oscillated sharply with peaks associated with pulses of high-quality food. Production of eggs was highest when offered continuous access to hosts and high quality food. Importantly, females fully recovered their reproductive capacity when fruit became available following a period of host deprivation. With no evidence of egg resorption and high levels of egg dumping, it appears that egg dumping may favour the continuous production of eggs such that the female's reproductive tissues are ready to respond to rapid changes in the availability of hosts. Our results exemplify the capacity of insects to maximize reproduction under variable and stressful environmental conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Monitoring of temperature in the stream sediment (0.25-1.2 m depth) as well as the stream itself was used to investigate groundwater-surface water interactions in two different Australian catchments (Border Rivers and Lower Richmond). When interpreted with hydrographic and hydraulic conductivity data, the temperature monitoring provided useful insights into the spatial and temporal variability of stream-aquifer connectivity. At one site, sediment temperatures fluctuated with the diurnal temperature variation of the stream, reflecting river leakage (losing conditions). No diurnal signal was detected in the sediment temperatures at other sites, which is a typical indicator of gaining conditions. However, with water-level measurements indicating negative gradients and the stream sediments dominated by clay at these sites, this lack of sediment temperature variability is interpreted to reflect very low rates of downward seepage. At one site, a transition from gaining to losing conditions was observed through time. In the field trials, operational issues such as timing the monitoring to coincide with reasonable diurnal variations of stream temperature, the requirement of understanding the shallow stratigraphy of the stream bed and separating out localised effects (such as weirs) were highlighted. The trials also highlighted that interpretation of the temperature data can be ambiguous when viewed in isolation. Results indicated that time-series measurements of sediment and stream temperatures can be a useful screening tool for identifying gaining and losing reaches and for identifying temporal variations in seepage flux. It is suggested that temperature loggers can be readily and cheaply incorporated into existing hydrographic networks to provide a greater understanding of stream-aquifer connectivity. It is also recommended that existing routine temperature logging (such as with pressure transducers) be upgraded to sufficient accuracy for seepage studies. Temperature monitoring would be particularly useful in estimating seepage from Australian ephemeral streams. These data also have relevance to the investigation and management of aquatic ecosystems, notably in the hyporheic zone.

AB  - The article substantiates the need to carry out a research of the factors affecting the change in the exchange rate of EUR/UAH due to the fact that the devaluation of the Ukrainian hryvnia in the last few years destabilizes the economic environment of entrepreneurship development. Thus, this work analyzes the determinants of the exchange rate in Ukraine, and the investigated correlation between the dependence of the EUR / UAH exchange rate on a set of factors confirmed the tight correlation between the change in money supply and government debt and the rise / fall in the EUR / UAH national currency. Instead, other factors (GDP, budget deficit, export operations, the positive balance of payments,inflation, public debt) have statistically insignificant correlation to the studied indicator and are not included in the regression model. It is suggested to harmonize monetary policy that has the greatest influence on the formation of the exchange rate, as well as to analyze the connection this policy with the foreign trade policy of the country, which will enable to stabilize the exchange rate as well as to ensure the formation of suitable conditions for the economic development of foreign economic entities.

AB  - Salinity shifts in estuarine and coastal areas are becoming a topic of concern and are one of the main factors influencing nanoparticles behaviour in the environment. For this reason, the impacts of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) under different seawater salinity conditions were evaluated on the common ragworm Hediste diversicolor, a polychaete species widely used as bioindicator of estuarine environmental quality. An innovative method to assess the presence of MWCNT aggregates in the sediments was used for the first time. Biomarkers approach was used to evaluate the metabolic capacity, oxidative status and neurotoxicity of polychaetes after long-term exposure. The results revealed an alteration of energy-related responses in contaminated polychaetes under both salinity conditions, resulting in an increase of metabolism and expenditure of their energy reserves (lower glycogen and protein contents). Moreover, a concentration-dependent toxicity (higher lipid peroxidation, lower ratio between reduced and oxidized glutathione and activation of antioxidant defences and biotransformation mechanisms) was observed in H. diversicolor, especially when exposed to low salinity. Additionally, neurotoxicity was observed by inhibition of Cholinesterases activity in organisms exposed to MWCNTs at both salinities.

AB  - Seed germination and early seedling growth are crucial stages for plant establishment. Two neutral (NaCl and Na2SO4) and two alkali (NaHCO3 and Na2CO3) salts were selected to investigate their effects on germination and recovery responses in Reaumuria soongorica. Results show that both salt types significantly reduced germination and radicle elongation. The rate of germination and emergence of R. soongorica seeds continuously decreased as salinity increased, and the time to achieve maximum germination rate was delayed. The speed of seed germination dropped rapidly as salt concentration increased. Alkaline salts restricted the germination rate of R. soongorica seeds, and stresses resulting from alkaline salts and high concentrations of neutral salts resulted in many deformed seedlings. The length of the radicle and germ decreased with increasing salt concentration, but certain concentrations of salt and increased pH promoted germ growth. The results of regression analysis show that salt concentration was the dominant factor inhibiting R. soongorica seed germination rate. Salinity, buffering capacity, and pH all affected embryo growth, but salinity had the most pronounced effect. Seed viability under highly saline conditions appears to be a better indicator of adaptation to saline environments than seed germination under saline conditions.

AB  - The lake-level record from Tulare Lake, CA has been shown to provide valuable constraints on late Pleistocene and Holocene runoff from the Sierra Nevada mountain range into the San Joaquin Valley of California, one of the world's most prolific agricultural centers. This project uses the magnetic properties of the Tulare Lake sediments in order to date the sediments and to constrain the relative lake level at the time of deposition. Shallowing lake conditions were identified leading up to a prominent unconformity; magnetic mineralogy and grain size indicators, primarily decreasing ARM/IRM and S-Ratio values suggest coarser grain sizes and more oxidizing conditions. Approximately half of the samples possessed well-behaved paleomagnetic directions suitable for paleomagnetic secular variation dating. The results indicate that the sediments below the unconformity were deposited approximately 7600-8500 cal yr BP, and the sediments above the unconformity were deposited approximately 2500-800 cal yr BP. The ages of the corresponding sediments are consistent with the time intervals during which previous studies indicate that lake level was above the elevation of this site, before and after a mid Holocene regression.

AB  - Testate amoebae are routinely used as paleoenvironmental indicators. However, considerable variability occurs in test morphology, even within commonly identified taxa. Relationships between morphological variability and environmental conditions might be useful in paleohydrological studies of peatlands, assuming good preservation of characteristics. Hyalosphenia papilio is a common taxon, well preserved in Sphagnum peatlands, that displays variability in the number of pores on the broad side of the test. We assessed whether variability in pore number was related to substrate moisture by comparing the abundance of individuals with different numbers of pores to measured water-table depths at 67 sites in North America. Results indicated that the abundance of individuals with higher numbers of pores increased in wetter conditions. Individuals with 2 pores were relatively widespread, although they dominated drier habitats. Transfer functions developed with and without pore-number quantification suggest that when communities contain abundant individuals with greater than 2 pores, water-table depth reconstructions can be improved by including pore-number information. Results have implications for peatland paleohydrological studies and suggest that greater exploitation of morphological variability could improve testate amoeba-based reconstructions of past environmental change.

AB  - Medium and high voltage power cables are widely used in the electrical industry with substantial growth over the last 20-30 years ago, particular in the use of XLPE insulated systems. Ageing of the cable insulation is becoming an increasing problem that requires development of reliable methods for on-line condition assessment. For insulation condition assessment of MV and HV cables, partial discharge (PD) monitoring is one of the most effective techniques. However on-site and on-line PD measurements are affected by electromagnetic interference (EMI) that makes sensitive PD detection very difficult, if not impossible. This paper describes implementation of wavelet transform techniques to reject noise. from on-line partial discharge measurements on cables. A new wavelet threshold determination method is proposed with the technique. With implementation of this novel de-noising method, PD measurement sensitivity has been greatly improved. In addition, a full ac cycle data recovery can be achieved instead of focusing only on recovering individual PD pulses. Other wavelet threshold de-noising methods are discussed and examined under a noisy environment to compare their performance with the new method proposed here. The method described here has been found to be superior to the other wavelet-based methods.

AB  - Chlorophyll fluorescence was measured under both laboratory and greenhouse conditions in an effort to develop a quick, reliable, and inexpensive laboratory procedure capable of predicting heat stress experienced by tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) under greenhouse conditions. The laboratory tests consisted of measurements of the ratio of variable to maximal chlorophyll nuorescence (F-v/F-m) performed on leaf discs taken from whole tomato leaves and placed on a temperature controlled plate. Comparisons were made with greenhouse measurements of the same parameter conducted on intact leaves of whole plants exposed to different temperature treatments imposed by manipulation of the aerial environment of the greenhouse. Dark adaption periods ranging from 15 min to all day in the greenhouse and temperature exposure periods ranging from 5 min to 60 min in the laboratory were compared to find the best correlation between the two tests. Best agreement was obtained with 60 min treatment times in the laboratory and 60 min dark adaption periods in the greenhouse. F-v/F-m decreased quadratically with increasing leaf temperature in a similar fashion in both tests, suggesting that the laboratory approach can adequately predict plant response to greenhouse heat stress.

AB  - Hypoxia is one of the major threats to biodiversity in aquatic systems. The association of hypoxia with nutrient-rich effluent input into aquatic systems results in scenarios where hypoxic waters could be contaminated with a wide range of chemicals, including metals. Despite this, little is known about the ability of fish to respond to hypoxia when exposures occur in the presence of environmental toxicants. We address this knowledge gap by investigating the effects of exposures to different levels of oxygen in the presence or absence of copper using the three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) model. Fish were exposed to different air saturations (AS; 100%, 75% and 50%) in combination with copper (20 mu g/L) over a 4 day period. The critical oxygen level (P-crit), an indicator of acute hypoxia tolerance, was 54.64 +/- 2.51% AS under control conditions, and 36.21 +/- 2.14% when fish were chronically exposed to hypoxia (50% AS) for 4 days, revealing the ability of fish to acclimate to low oxygen conditions. Importantly, the additional exposure to copper (20 mu g/L) prevented this improvement in Perin impairing hypoxia acclimation. In addition, an increase in ventilation rate was observed for combined copper and hypoxia exposure, compared to the single stressors or the controls. Interestingly, in the groups exposed to copper, a large increase in variation in the measured P-crit was observed between individuals, both under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. This variation, if observed in wild populations, may lead to selection for a tolerant phenotype and alterations in the gene pool of the populations, with consequences for their sustainability. Our findings provide strong evidence that copper reduces the capacity of fish to respond to hypoxia by preventing acclimation and will inform predictions of the consequences of global increases of hypoxia in water systems affected by other pollutants worldwide.

AB  - Multi-element analysis including stable isotopes can be used as a possible indicator for food safety and security. For the certification of geographical origin, the analytical methods can be performed in two ways: one where multivariate analysis is used to determine the concentrations of such omnipresent elements as Al, Ca, Cl, Mg, Mn, Fe and Zn, and one that focuses on such special elements as the stable isotope ratios of Sr, O, and H. For the certification of production methods, especially those regarding organic products, delta N-15 values could be a potential indicator, particularly in such protected cultivations as in a plant factory (advanced-type greenhouse horticulture). Because the accuracy of these values is affected by production conditions, the delta N-15 values of products can be predicted more accurately under controlled conditions, such as in a plant factory using delta N-15-evaluated fertilizer, medium, and water. Non-destructive systems have been developed for measuring both the level of elements in a product and the production environment, such as soil conditions. In the near future, the results of chemically analyzed and those of non-destructively analyzed elemental composition will become interconnected to non-destructively certify the geographical origin and production method of agricultural products. All these destructive methods have been used to a limited extent for practical regulation as an analysis guideline; however, a combined system involving the use of the newly developed detector (non-destructive), data collection, and analysis using artificial intelligence could address the issue of falsely labeled products for practical application. Particularly in a plant factory, production is controlled and regulated, allowing the tracing of products from the farm to the table. In this context, the greenhouse production system would be an advanced example for the practical use of food safety combined with analytical chemistry and information communication technology.

AB  - The Huadian and Fushun basins, located along the DunMi fault zone (NE China), are filled with non-marine coal- and oil shale-bearing sediments of Eocene age. Despite similar tectonic setting, the habitat of coal and oil shale differs significantly. During this study the depositional environment of organic-rich sediments in the Huadian Basin and factors controlling differences between both basins were investigated. Early in the history of the Huadian Basin, thin coaly and bituminous mudstones accumulated in shallow lake environments (Pyrite Member). Water depth increased during deposition of the Oil Shale Member, but did not exceed a few tens of meters preventing stable water column stratification. Moreover, deposition of fan delta sediments interrupted accumulation of fine-grained rocks. Nevertheless, algal blooms and oxygen-depleted conditions resulted in accumulation of 13 thin (<7 m) oil shale layers. Oil shale quality varies between different layers due to variable portions of terrestrial organic matter. Ash-rich coal layers mined in the Huadian Basin developed during the regressive late stage of basin evolution (Carbonaceous Shale Member). Biomarkers indicate a change from an angiosperm-to a gymnosperm-dominated vegetation. In the Fushun Basin, a single 120-m-thick coal seam formed during early basin subsidence. Subsequently, high subsidence rates established deep lacustrine conditions with photic zone anoxia and a water depth probably exceeding 150 m. Stable, strictly anoxic conditions allowed accumulation of a 300-m-thick oil shale layer. The main factor controlling differences between the Huadian and Fushun basins is tectonic subsidence.
   High subsidence rates in the Fushun Basin favored deposition of thick coal during the transgressive stage and of oil shale in a deep lake. In contrast minor subsidence in the Huadian Basin resulted in a lake with moderate water depth and deposition of several oil shale layers with varying quality. In this basin economic coal developed only during the regressive stage. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Benzophenone (BP)-type ultraviolet (UV) filters are widely used in cosmetic and sunscreen products and can enter the aquatic environment. Therefore, we investigated the subchronic toxicity of 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (BP1) on the marine calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa in an early life-stage development study. Since developmental endpoints depend on environmental conditions, a preceding study of A. tonsa development was performed at three temperatures, four salinities, four light:dark regimes, six food densities, and four culture densities. Times elapsed until 50% of the population had reached a copepodite stage (DT1/2) at the different conditions were calculated. The DT1/2 values decreased from 296 h at 15 degrees C to 89 h at 25 degrees C and were also affected by salinity (126 h at 15 parts per thousand and 167 h at 30 parts per thousand.), whereas the light:dark regime and culture density influenced development only to a minor extent. BP1 was found acutely toxic at 2.6 mg/L (48-h median lethal concentration [LC50]). The toxicity of BPI on early life-stage development was studied in combinations of three temperatures (15, 20, 25 degrees C) and three salinities (15, 20, 25 parts per thousand) using five toxicant concentrations between 0.051 and 2 mg/L in each scenario. Concentrations causing 10 and 50% inhibition of development (EC10 and EC50) were determined. Acartia tonsa was most resistant towards BPI at 20 degrees C where an EC50 of 1.1 mg/L was found, whereas EC50 values were significantly lower at 15 degrees C (0.49 mg/L) and 25 degrees C (0.77 mg/L), respectively. The EC50 also decreased with increasing salinity. Our results demonstrate that environmental conditions do influence toxicity test results; thus, they need to be considered carefully when developing test protocols as well as for environmental risk assessments of chemicals.

AB  - Pavements in roadway and parking lots occupy large urban areas and contribute to the development of urban heat island (UHI). Photovoltaic (PV) pavement can use PV panels on conventional asphalt concrete (AC) pavement to harvest solar energy at light traffic conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the potential benefit of PV pavement to mitigate UHI effect. First, the heat transfer models for AC and PV pavements were developed. The pavement surface temperature and heat output from pavement surface to near-surface environment were then calculated that were used as the indicator of pavement contribution to UHI effect. A parametric study was conducted to analyze the influences of front glass and wind speed on thermal performance of PV pavement. Varying the thickness and transmittance of front glass have shown noticeable influences on pavement temperature, while the change of heat output is limited. Although the increase of average wind speed results in lower pavement temperatures, the heat output experiences slightly increase. The comparison of PV pavement and conventional AC pavement shows that PV pavement can decrease surface temperature by 3-5 degrees C in summer and generate 11-12% less heat output at various climate conditions.

AB  - This study focuses on the characterization of historical drought occurrences in the Horne Poitavie region of Slovakia over the period 1966-2013 using Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Trend analyses were evaluated by the Mann-Kendall (MK) test as well as cumulative sum of rank difference (CRD) test. The results showed that drought occurs in the region regularly (recurrent climate feature), while the trend analysis indicated the trend toward more arid climatic conditions. However, CRD trend analyses showed that the subtrend changed direction toward less drier conditions in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Analyses of SPEI trends in individual months showed a decreasing trend of drought occurrences during the cold months of the year (i.e., October to March), while an increasing trend was indicated from April to August. The evaluation of the impact of drought on agricultural production based on the oilseed rape yield indicated that drought represents a significant natural risk for the agrarian sector of the region. In addition, August value of the SPEI for six months was evaluated as a good indicator of drought impacts on agriculture. The trend analyses revealed no significant increase of drought impacts on agricultural production within the studied period.

AB  - The focus of today's agriculture is to reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emission. More than 50% of the fuel energy is lost with the exhaust gas and coolant of diesel engines. Therefore, waste heat recovery systems are a promising concept to meet economical and ecological requirements. Agricultural vehicles have an operating cycle that is quite different from on-road trucks (higher engine load factor and less annual utilization). This has influence on the efficiency of waste heat recovery. The purpose of this paper was to analyze different waste heat recovery technologies to be used in agricultural applications. In the study, technical and economic indicators have been used. According to suggested classification, four pathways for utilization were studied. Turbocompounding, electric turbocompounding, and heating of transmission oil for hydraulic clutch gearboxes have proved to be effective for agricultural vehicles. For the economical conditions of the European Union (EU), a turbocompounding diesel engine is acceptable if agricultural tractor rated power is more than 275 kW, and combine harvester rated power is more than 310 kW. In cold climates, heat recovery transmission warm-up may be recommended. Waste heat absorption refrigerators have proven to be a viable technology for air conditioning and intake air cooling systems.

AB  - The degradation of steel pipe structures, especially thickness reduction due to corrosion is a common problem found in marine structures. This calls for an evaluation of the thin structure's structural health condition to ensure its safety and reliability. This study investigates the effect of reduction in pipe wall thickness on the pipe structure's dynamic behaviour using the fundamental modal parameter as the indicator for its health condition. A finite element analysis utilising Abaqus software has been adapted to model the problem. The corrosion problem was simulated by thickness reduction on six damage cases. The influence of the severity and position of damage on the observed mode upon the percentage of natural frequencies' reduction and localisation of mode shape of the pipe structure are subsequently displayed. Four mode shapes and its corresponding natural frequency were extracted from baseline model to further evaluate the sensitivity of the selected mode towards the presence of damage. The study found that severe damage in pipe structure leads to significant reduction of natural frequency and localisation of mode shape in the vicinity of damaged region. The vibration results summarised in this paper may serve as a benchmark for researchers and as a reference for design engineers.

AB  - Domoic acid is a potent neurotoxin produced by certain marine microalgae that can accumulate in the foodweb, posing a health threat to human seafood consumers and wildlife in coastal regions worldwide. Evidence of climatic regulation of domoic acid in shellfish over the past 20 y in the Northern California Current regime is shown. The timing of elevated domoic acid is strongly related to warm phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Oceanic Nino Index, an indicator of El Nino events. Ocean conditions in the northeast Pacific that are associated with warm phases of these indices, including changes in prevailing currents and advection of anomalously warm water masses onto the continental shelf, are hypothesized to contribute to increases in this toxin. We present an applied domoic acid risk assessment model for the US West Coast based on combined climatic and local variables. Evidence of regional-to basin-scale controls on domoic acid has not previously been presented. Our findings have implications in coastal zones worldwide that are affected by this toxin and are particularly relevant given the increased frequency of anomalously warm ocean conditions.

AB  - Objective: This article offers an extensive review of Sustainable Competitiveness as an integrating concept bridging current understandings around sustainable development and encompassing the aspects of economic, social and environmental sustainability.
   Research Design & Methods: Concepts related to sustainable development are reviewed and their relationships to Sustainable Competitiveness are considered. The concept of Sustainable Competitiveness is related to a set of effective metrics.
   Findings: The Sustainability Adjusted Global Competitiveness Index (SGCI), which comprehensively measures cross-country sustainable competitiveness, is identified as a credible synthetic metric for measuring separate aspects of sustainable development across a range of countries.
   Implications & Recommendations: The approach enables disaggregation between three separate elements which have an impact on sustainable competitiveness, namely Basic Conditions, Efficiency Enhancers and Innovation Conditions. It is concluded that extending the measurement from GCI to SGCI offers a potential for considering international competitiveness performance from the environmental and social sustainability perspectives. Extensions to SGCI are also proposed.
   Contribution & Value Added: The conceptual discussion indicates that the main features relevant to sustainable development appear in the concept and the measure of sustainable competitiveness. The application of the measure to a time-series of data would permit an analysis of the relationships between economic, social and environmental aspects (separately) with measured sustainable competitiveness.

AB  - The process of mechanotransduction of bone, the conversion of a mechanical stimulus into a biochemical response, is known to occur in osteoblasts in response to fluid shear stress. In order to understand the reaction of osteoblasts to various times of flow perfusion, osteoblasts were seeded on three-dimensional scaffolds, and cultured in the following conditions: continuous flow perfusion, intermittent flow perfusion, and static condition. We collected samples on day 4, 8 and 12 for analysis. Osteoblast proliferation was demonstrated by cell proliferation and scanning electron microscopy assay. Additionally, the expression of known markers of differentiation, including alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, were tested by qRT-PCR and alkaline phosphatase activity assay, and the deposition of calcium was used as an indicator of mineralization demonstrated by calcium content assay. The results supported that low fluid shear stress plays an important role in the activation of osteoblasts: enhance cell proliferation, increase calcium deposition, and promote the expression of osteoblastic markers. Furthermore, the continuous flow perfusion is a more favorable environment for the initiation of osteoblast activity compared with intermittent flow perfusion. Therefore, the force and time of fluid shear stress are important parameters for osteoblast activation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Estimates of past precipitation are of broad interest for many areas of inquiry, including reconstructions of past environments and topography, climate modeling, and ocean circulation studies. The shapes and sizes of living leaves are highly sensitive to moisture conditions, and assemblages of fossil leaves of flowering plants have great potential as paleoprecipitation indicators. Most quantitative estimates of paleoprecipitation have been based on a multivariate data set of morphological leaf characters measured from samples of living vegetation tied to climate stations. However, when tested on extant forests, this method has consistently overestimated precipitation. We present a simpler approach that uses only the mean leaf area of a vegetation sample as a predictor variable but incorporates a broad range of annual precipitation and geographic coverage into the predictor set. The significant relationship that results, in addition to having value for paleoclimatic reconstruction, refines understanding of the long-observed positive relationship between leaf area and precipitation. Seven precipitation estimates for the Eocene of the Western United States are revised as lower than previously published but remain far wetter than the same areas today. Abundant moisture may have been an important factor in maintaining warm, frost-free conditions in the Eocene because of the major role of water vapor in retaining and transporting atmospheric heat.

AB  - Aerially and fluvially distributed fine mineral particles produced by mining operations are an important source of toxic elements, such as arsenic, in surface environments. Limited data exists on the short-term stability of these particles in agricultural soils and the associated risk of producing contaminated crops. This study investigated whether arsenopyrite (FeAsS), the principal arsenic ore, undergoes oxidation-dissolution at a rate that is relevant to crop growth, and evaluated the availability of the alteration products to common crops. Temperate and sub-tropical soils were spiked (0.1% m/m) with ground arsenopyrite (<63 mu m) and incubated for intervals of up to one year prior to analyses for phosphate-exchangeable arsenic and soluble sulfate (alteration indicators). Triticum aestivum (spring wheat) was grown in the spiked temperate soil to evaluate plant arsenic uptake. Arsenopyrite platelets were exposed to field soil conditions (2 years) and examined for secondary alteration phases. Arsenopyrite oxidation-dissolution was extensive and rapid (<= 66% in 180 days) in both soils. The As concentration in seeds of plants from spiked soils (21.2 nmol g(-1) As) was significantly higher than for plants grown in control soils (1.88 nmol g(-1) As). Secondary Fe-O-As phases formed agglomerates and rims at the soil-mineral interface under field conditions.
   This study demonstrates that the contamination of agricultural soils with fine arsenopyrite particles is a serious hazard in soils formed under contrasting geological and climatic settings. Uptake of As into edible tissue and hence the risk to human health was, under the present experimental conditions, moderated by three key processes: (1) Passivation layer formation on the weathering arsenopyrite surfaces effectively halted oxidation-dissolution after 180 days exposure to the soil environment; (2) Secondary phase formation efficiently sequestered arsenic from soil solution, reducing its mobility and therefore phytoavailability. (3) Spring wheat appeared to actively limit the translocation of arsenic to the edible tissues (seeds). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Field experiments were conducted at the Joniskelis Experimental Station of the Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry during 2009-2012. The study was aimed to explore the effects of the ecological fertilizer Ekoplant and the bio-activators Biokal 01 and Terra Sorb Foliar on the formation of the productivity elements, grain yield and quality of spelt (Triticum spelta L.) cv. Tranckenkorn' and common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cv. 'Toms' in an organic cropping system on an clay loam Endocakari-Endohypogleyic Cambisol (CMg-n-w-can). The weather conditions, especially those during crop wintering, differed between years and this affected the grain yield of both winter wheat species and resulted in different fertilizer efficacy. In 2010 and 2012, the winter wheat crops overwintered well and the yield of common wheat was by 27.6% and 30.1%, respectively higher than that of spelt. 111 2011, due to the contrasting winter conditions with a spell of unusually high temperatures in January followed by a sharp drop of temperature to 25 C the crop of common wheat thinned out more than spelt, which resulted in a significantly lower common wheat grain yield. In 2010 and 2011, the application of ecological fertilizer Ekoplant as well as in combination with Biokal 01 and Terra Sorb Foliar led to an increase in the values of biometric indicators, i.e. stem mass, ear length and mass, grain number per ear significantly increased having used Ekoplant fertilizer in combination with Terra Sorb Foliar. However, in 2012, Biokal 01 exerted the most marked positive effect on the biometric indicators of wheat. The highest yield increase for both wheat species was observed when Ekoplant fertilizer had been used in combination with the bio-activator Biokal 01. The Ekoplant fertilizer as well as in combination with the bio-activator Biokal 01 did not have any significant effect on grain quality indicators, while the bio-activator Biokal 01 increased the protein and gluten content by 2.2% and 3.4%, respectively.

AB  - Maize production trials carried out in eastern middle of Germany from 1999-2007 were used for statistical analysis of the optimum date for silage maize ripeness, quality and yield potential as well as choice of cultivar under drought conditions for silage and energy maize.
   The Silage maize Ripeness Index (the ratio of dry matter content of maize grains to dry matter content of stover) is more suitable for the determination of harvest date, yield maximum and silage maize quality as the dry matter content of the plant. The analysis is cheaper as well as not so material and time-consuming in comparison to the dry matter content of the silage maize of different hybrid maize populations and environments.
   Ensilage optimum and yield maximum correspond almost with the physiological ripeness of silage maize and are close to the grain dry matter content of 60 to 65%, to the dry matter content of stover under 24% and a ripeness index from 2,5 and higher. Only under these conditions it is possible to reach the optimal ripeness of 30 to 35% in the whole plant silage maize.
   In dependence on the Silage maize Ripeness Index (SRZ) parameters of silage and energy maize were created differential ripeness optimum, quality and yield potential. The aims of silage and energy maize are similar. The vitality of stover has a greater importance for energy maize.
   The Silage maize Ripeness Index (SRI) is, for whole plant maize, better than the Whole Plant Maize Ripeness Index (SRZ) for the choice of a hybrid in Germany. The dry matter content of grain in interaction with the dry matter of stover are better than dry matter content of the whole plant maize as ripeness indicator in the production of silage and energy maize for the harvesting time. SRI is also suitable for use as a standard in scientific trials and for better characteristic of cultivar types and environmental influence.

AB  - The effect of biotic factors such as species, condition factor, body weight and total length of fish on concentrations of iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and manganese (Mn) in organs of Rutilus rutilus (L.), Abramis brama (L.), Coregonus lavaretus (L.), Esox lucius (L.), Perca fluviatilis (L.) and Tinca tinca (L.) from reservoirs of Warmia and Mazury region (northeastern Poland) were determined. Differences in the content of metals were observed between species (p <= 0.05). Some metals demonstrated specific affinity for particular tissues. Lower concentrations of metals were found in muscles and ranged as follows: Zn 3.427-9.950, Fe 1.297-2.550, Cu 0.133-0.279 and Mn 0.050-0.162 (expressed mg kg(-1) wet weight). The highest levels of Fe (33.49-123.6) and Cu (3.994-27.14) (except for copper in perch) found in the liver (p <= 0.05) was related to detoxification, whereas high concentrations of Mn (1.366-5.113) and Zn (15.91-135.0) (except for Zn in tench) in gills may be associated with excretion processes or uptake (p <= 0.05). The two organs (gills and liver) may be used as bioindicators of metal contamination of aquatic environments. Studies on the size and condition factor dependency of heavy metal concentrations have showed that, although the relationship exists, in most cases it was not statistically significant for organs. Metal Pollution Index (MPI) in organs of fish examined was 1.503<MPI<3.575. The daily per capita consumption of 34 g of fish examined showed 0.317-0.624% of Fe, 1.174-3.408% of Zn, 0.455-0.955% of Cu and 0.085-0.278% of Mn of the RDA reference dose.

AB  - One of the possible ways of creating new drugs is aiming synthesis of compounds previously envisaged activity. Perspective in this area is to obtain complexes based on metal ions and ligands.
   Purpose: To establish toxikometric characteristics of new biologically active substances-tartratogermanat copper and zinc in the acute experiment.
   Materials and methods: Studied acute toxicity in mice and rats under the conditions of oral (o), subcutaneous (s/c) and intraperitoneal (i/p) administration. The toxicity criterion of the test compounds was LD50, which was determined using the probit analysis method. In addition, a number of integrated toxicity indicators were calculated, in particular absolute toxicity, an acute toxic effect zone, a summary toxicity index and etc.
   The results: According to the results, the LD50 index of copper-tartratogermanate in mice was 36.88 mg/kg (i/p) 63.78 mg/kg (s/c) and 385.57 mg/kg (o); in rats -78.16; 135.05 and 794.26 m/kg, accordingly. The LD50 index of zinc-tartratogermanate in mice was 87.20 mg/kg (i/p) 167.05 mg/kg (s/c) and 1675.40 mg/kg (o); in rats -141.57; 236.52 and 2792.45 mu/kg, accordingly. The new compound of zinc tartratogermanat belongs to low-toxic compounds (IV class of toxicity) in conditions of intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and oral administration in two animal species, in the same time-tartratogermanat copper is moderately toxic (toxicity class III). Zinc-containing compounds showed lower toxicity than similar compounds with cuprum. According to the resalts, the variability of the lethal doses for various routes of administration of copper tartrate-hommanate was 1.32-1.60 (in mice) and 1.66-1.92 (in rats) zinc tartrate-germanate, 1.31-1.50 (in mice) and 1.24-1.37 (in rats). Integral safety of the new BA. showes that compounds with zinc were more safety in oral take, while new compounds containing copper were the safest under conditions of injection.
   Conclusions: A small toxicity of new compounds tartratogermanat zinc and copper indicates the prospects for their further preclinical studies as potential drugs.

AB  - Grass silage was evaluated as a possible substrate in anaerobic digestion for generation of biogas in mesophilic and thermophilic long-term operation. Furthermore, the molecular biological parameter Metabolic Quotient (MQ) was evaluated as early warning system to predict process disturbance. Since this substrate is rich in nitrogen, high ammonia concentration of up to 2.2 g * kg(FM)(-1) emerged. The high buffer capacity of the ammonium/ammonia system can disguise upcoming process acidification. At organic loading rates (OLR) below 1.0 kgvs * m(-3)* d(-1) (VS: volatile solids) for thermophilic and below 1.5 kgvs * m(-3) * d(-1) for mesophilic reactors, stable processes were established. With increasing OLR, the process was stressed until it broke down in the thermophilic reactors at an OLR of 3.5 kgvs * m(-3) * d(-1) or was stopped at an OLR of 4.5 kgvs * m(-3) * d(-1) in the mesophilic reactors. Mainly propionic acid accumulated in concentrations of up to 6.5 g * kg(FM.)(-1) Due to the high buffer capacity of the reactor sludge, the chemical parameter VA/TIC (ratio of total volatile acids to total inorganic carbon) did not clearly indicate process disturbance in advance. In contrast, the MQ indicated metabolic stress of the methanogens before process breakdown and thus showed its potential as early warning system for process breakdown. During the whole experiment, hydrogenotrophic methanogens dominated. In the thermophilic reactors, Methanoculleus IIA-2 sp. 2 and Methanothermobacter wolfeii were dominant during stable process conditions and were displaced by Methanobacterium III sp. 4, a possible new bioindicator for disturbances at these conditions. In the mesophilic reactors, mainly Methanobacterium III sp. 4 was dominant at stable, stressed and acidified processes. A hitherto uncultivated genospecies, Methanobacteriaceae genus IV(B) sp. 3 was determined as possible new bioindicator for mesophilic process disturbance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Campylobacter spp. are frequently carried by poultry, but they are not believed to cause significant disease in these animals. Modern poultry breeds have been selected to grow rapidly under intensive conditions, but recently, consumers have moved toward purchasing birds produced in higher welfare, free-range or organic systems. Birds reared in these systems tend to be a slower growing breed and are fed a different diet. Birds reared in such systems are stocked at a lower density compared with the standard conventional broilers, and they have access to environmental enrichment, such as perches. In previous research, these slower growing birds have been shown to have different levels of Campylobacter carriage in commercial rearing conditions, but the reasons for, and effect of, these different levels are unknown; is it the bird breed, diet, or environmental conditions? In this study, experimental flocks of fast- and slow-growing breeds of broiler chickens were reared to a standard commercial slaughter weight, with their weight gain being measured during the growing period. At 21 days, birds were either infected with Campylobacter jejuni or given a placebo as control. Cohorts of birds were euthanatized at various intervals, and samples were taken for examination for Campylobacter. The fast- growing birds gained weight more rapidly than the slow-growing birds. By 2 days postinfection (dpi), C. jejuni was detected in the caeca and by enrichment from the liver and spleen samples from both breeds of birds. Low-level colonization persisted in the spleen and liver samples but was undetectable by 28 dpi. Fast- and slow-growing birds did not show detectably different levels of Campylobacter carriage. Infection with C. jejuni affected the incidence of hock marks and pododermatitis in both breeds of birds, but the differences were greater with the fast- growing breed compared with the uninfected control birds. In addition, the incidence of pododermatitis was significantly higher in Campylobacter-positive fast- growing birds than in their slower-growing counterparts. The results show that infection with Campylobacter can have an indirect welfare effect on birds via increased incidence of hock marks and pododermatitis.

AB  - The amount of time it takes for created wetlands to develop soils comparable to natural wetlands is relatively unknown. Surface soil changes over time were evaluated in two created wetlands (approximately 1 ha each) at the Olentangy River Welland Research Park in Columbus, Ohio. The two wetlands were constructed in 1993 to be identical in size and geomorphology, and maintained to have the same hydrology. The only initial difference between the wetlands was that one was planted with native macrophytes while the other was not. In May 2004, soil samples were collected (10 yr and 2 mo after the wetlands were flooded) and compared to samples collected in 1993 (after the wetlands were excavated but before flooding) and 1995 (18 mo after the wetlands were flooded). In all three years, soils were split into surface (0-8 cm) and subsurface (8-16 cm) depths and analyzed for soil organic matter, total C, total P, available P, exchangeable cations, and pH. Soils in the two wetlands have changed substantially through sedimentation and organic accretion. Between 1993 and 1995, soils were most influenced by the deposition of senescent macroalgae, the mobilization of soluble nutrients, and the precipitation Of CaCO3 Between 1995 and 2004, soil parameters were influenced more by the deposition of organic matter from colonized macrophyte communities. Mean percent organic matter at the surface increased from 5.3 +/- 0.1% in 1993, 6.1 +/- 0.2% in 1995, to 9.5 +/- 0.2% in 2004. Mean total P increased from 493 +/- 18 mu g g(-1) in 1993, 600 +/- 23 mu g g(-1) in 1995, to 724 +/- 20 mu g g(-1) in 2004. Spatial analyses of percent organic matter (a commonly used indicator of hydric soil condition) at both wetlands in 1993, 1995, and 2004 showed that soil conditions have become increasingly more variable. High spatial structure (autocorrelation) between data points was detected in 1993 and 2004, with data in 2004 exhibiting a much higher overall variance and narrower range of spatial structure than in 1993.

AB  - Among the most challenging problems in the field of damage detection and condition assessment in large structures is the ability to reliably detect, locate, and quantify relatively small changes in their dynamic response, based on vibration signal analysis. In this study, a substructuring approach, which uses a nonparametric identification method, was applied to simulated damage data from a high-fidelity and validated three-dimensional (3D) finite element model of a 52-story high-rise office building, located in downtown Los Angeles. Results of this study indicate that the approach not only yields identification results that match well-known global (linear) system identification methods, such as NExT/ERA, but it also provides additional benefits that global identification approaches suffer from. These benefits include: (1) enhanced sensitivity to small structural parameter changes, (2) ability to provide location information about the region in the large structure in which damage has occurred, and (3) not assuming that the underlying structure is linear. Thus, the approach is capable of detecting, quantifying, and classifying changes, when they do occur, if the actual building is subjected to strong earthquake ground motion.

AB  - The genus Dicrostonyx (the collared lemming) is undoubtedly the small mammal best adapted to the extreme conditions of the arctic environment. The Palearctic collared lemming has been described in numerous European Late Pleistocene localities up to south of France and Croatia. This species experienced climate-driven changes through time, changes mainly observed as repetitive pulses of pan-continental migration, and it thus became a typical indicator of glacial conditions. Using geometric morphometrics on molars, we evaluate the shape changes occurring during the last 100 ky over some dispersal events in Western Europe. The results point out that Dicrostonyx torquatus has a large intra-population variation with a homogenous morphology, regardless of the origin of the individuals. A temporal trend leading to a more complex tooth with a differentiated anterior loop on the first lower molar was observed. An additional effect of the distance from the core populations was also described with a more peculiar shape for the most western populations of France. These temporal and geographical trends might relate to the different migratory pulses documented from ancient DNA haplotypes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study proposes a new evaluation method based on expert scoring and data normalization to optimize operational conditions of sludge pyrolysis and assess the comprehensive benefits of the adsorption process in coking wastewater treatment. Pyrolysis temperature, holding time and heating rate were considered as the experimental parameters in sludge pyrolysis. They were optimized by the proposed method, considering raw material cost, net energy consumption, carbon emission and adsorption capacity of sludge-derived bio-char (SB). Two operational modes (cyclic centralized and traditional distributed) were compared to identify a better solution for coking wastewater treatment. The results showed that the optimized operational conditions of coking sludge pyrolysis were that temperature of 550 degrees C, holding time of 60 min and heating rate of 20 degrees C/min, using the proposed method. Cyclic centralized mode has been demonstrated as the better mode for wastewater treatment by the proposed method, due to the higher comprehensive score of -0.296. It is a promising technology for sustainable wastewater treatment in terms of sludge recycling, energy saving and carbon emission reduction.

AB  - An index system comprising four primary indicators and 47 secondary indicators was constructed for earthquake emergency and rescue, based on recent earthquake disaster relief cases, relevant Chinese policies and regulations, and recent literature. Using a questionnaire survey and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), then an investigation method was designed to determine the importance awareness of the factors affecting the earthquake emergency and rescue. Finally, by performing a case study of two areas in China, i.e., Yunnan and Jiangsu, the similarities and differences in the importance awareness of the factors affecting the earthquake emergency and rescue in different regions were investigated and analysed. The understanding of the importance of the highest ranked factors was nearly similar, and the ranked order of the most important factors was highly consistent. However, obvious differences were observed in the understanding of the importance of certain factors. The understanding of the "basic environmental background", which is a first-level index, and 10 s-level index factors (e.g., industrial hazards control level, topographic relief, lithology, depositional conditions and climatic conditions) were significantly different.

AB  - In mass housing apartments, the comfort and quality of living conditions may be adversely affected by wind and noise especially on balconies, terraces, gardens and around swimming pools etc. The quantitative and empirical testing of building models according to physical conditions with regard to wind and noise parameters directly affects the formation of buildings in the design process. In this paper, two cities (Istanbul and Diyabakir), which are selected from two different climatic zones in Turkey are considered as examples to create maximum comfortable usage areas depending on wind and noise effects. For mass housing settlement scenarios, common comfortable areas in terms of wind and noise were determined by using Urbawind and soundPLAN softwares. The relevant data and acceptance criteria related to wind and noise and applied procedure are presented in the work. Performed studies show, if the settlements have dominant wind and noise directions, it is possible to find solutions using the geometric properties of the settlement in terms of wind and noise. In general, better comfort results appear in alternatives with L-C-U shaped design features rather than point-type and linear block layouts.

AB  - This study explores the consistency between objective indicators and subjective perceptions of quality of life in a ranking of survey data for cities and counties in Taiwan. Data used for analysis included the Statistical Yearbook of Hsiens and Municipalities and the Survey on Living Conditions of Citizens in Taiwan, both given for the year 2000. The Quality of life was examined in seven domains: medical services, domestic finances, work, education, leisure, public safety, and environmental quality. Subjective and objective rankings for each domain of quality of life for 23 areas (some areas are cities and some are counties) are compared. Analysis by means of nonparametric correlation coefficients indicates that there is no significant correlation between objective indicators and subjective perceptions, except in Education and Environmental Quality. Objective indicators of Environmental Quality (air pollution and garbage) are positively correlated with subjective satisfaction with residential environment. But inexplicably, higher levels of literacy and educational achievement are negatively correlated with satisfaction with the educational system. It may be considered that disparity in either average objective conditions or in average subjective perceptions may not adequately depict quality of life differences.

AB  - Pump shafts used for power generation are susceptible to fatigue cracking while often in near-continuous operation. Technology based on torsional vibration is under development for condition-based assessment of shaft health. The focus of this paper is on the relationship between a crack, which propagated due to bending loads, and the torsional stiffness of the shaft. An analytical method to determine the compliance associated with a crack has been implemented for a semi-elliptical surface crack. A 3-D finite element model of a shaft section with a crack has also been used to predict the effect of a crack on stiffness. Fatigue cracks were seeded in shafts on a three-point bend apparatus. A benchtop test rig was constructed to evaluate the torsional natural frequencies of a cracked shaft system. Quasistatic torsional stiffness tests indicated that crack closure has an effect on the results. A torsional finite element model of the benchtop test rig indicates that the first torsional natural frequency is reduced by the propagation of a crack. The reduction in torsional stiffness of the shaft inferred from the natural frequency results is in reasonable agreement with the quasistatic results and the model predictions.

AB  - Coelomocytes are considered to be immune effecters of sea urchins. Subpopulations of coelomocytes can be purified from a total cell suspension. The proportion of each cell type can vary not only among species, but also between individuals of the same species, according to their size and physiological conditions. We tested the hypothesis that coelomocytes play a role in defense mechanisms activated by adverse external conditions. Total coelomocytes from control and stressed (temperature, pollution, and injuries) sea urchins were analyzed for their expression of the 70 kDa heat shock protein (hsp70), a well recognized stress marker. Further analysis was performed by separation of coelomocytes into subpopulations by step gradients, We demonstrated that sea urchin coelomocytes respond to temperature shock and to polluted seawater by the upregulation of hsp70. Among coelomocytes certain cells, known as red spherula cells, showed a great increase in number in animals collected from polluted seawaters or subjected to "accidental" injury. The present study confirms the immunological function of sea urchin coelomocytes, as indicated by the upregulation of the hsp70 molecular marker, and suggests that sea urchin coelomocytes can be utilized as sensitive bio-indicators of environmental stress.

AB  - During environmental risk assessments of chemicals, higher-tier biodegradation tests in soil, sediment, and surface-water systems are required using OECD standards 307, 308, and 309 guidelines, respectively. These guidelines are not suitable for testing highly volatile chemicals, and a biometer closed-incubation setup is recommended for testing slightly volatile chemicals. In this setup, the degradation kinetics of highly volatile chemicals can largely be influenced by volatilization. Additionally, guidelines lack sufficient information on test-system geometry and guidance on how to measure and maintain aerobic conditions during the test. Our objectives were (1) to design a closed test setup for biodegradation tests in soil in which the maintaining and measuring of aerobic conditions was possible without the loss of volatile test chemicals and (2) to suggest data-treatment measures for evaluating the degradation kinetics of volatile test chemicals. With the new setup, full-scale OECD 307 tests were performed using the volatile C-14-labeled chemicals decane and tetralin. For both test chemicals, reproducible complete mass balances were observed, and the new setup ensured that the volatilization losses were kept below the mineralized fraction. Based on the obtained data, an extended model was developed that enabled consideration of the volatilization in the modeling of degradation kinetics.

AB  - Native mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis are used as bioindicator organisms to assess the concentration levels and toxic effects of persistent chemicals, polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and heavy metals using biomarker responses, such as catalase (CAT), glutathione s-transferase (GST), and condition indices, for the Algerian coast. The results show that mussels of Oran Harbour are extremely polluted by PCBs and PAHs, i.e., 97.6 and 2892.1 mu g/kg d.w., respectively. Other sites present low levels of pollution. Furthermore, high concentrations of zinc, lead and cadmium are found in mussels from fishing, agricultural and estuarine sites, respectively, while low concentrations of copper are found in all of the sites studied. CAT activity is negatively correlated with Cd and Cu, and Zn is positively correlated with GST and CAT. Site classification tools reveal the potential toxicity of coastal areas exposed to anthropogenic pressure and a gradient of toxicity along the Algerian west coast. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

KW  - Malaysia
AB  - Since the year 2005, Malaysia has been moving away from constructing new buildings in favour of refurbishing historic and old ones. This is due to a number of reasons, including the economic crisis, land limitation and sustainable issues. However, when a historic building is refurbished, there is seldom any methodical study made of the occupants' opinions concerning indoor environmental quality. There are few studies on refurbished buildings on indoor environmental quality (IEQ) which should serve as a key building performance indicator. This study uses a questionnaire to document the occupant's perception towards the indoor environmental condition of six refurbished historic buildings in Malaysia. Analysis was carried out by normalising the data producing a fingerprint for preference as well as the level of importance. A correlation between preferences of the individual occupant score towards the overall buildng condition was also conducted. The paper shows that the questionnaire can be used effectively to survey all of indoor environment aspects as it has the advantage of looking at both negative and positive aspects of the environment. It is believed that this study would assist in the identification of any particular aspect of the environment that requires adjustment and improvement to provide a better internal environment for the occupants.

AB  - Sources of Escherichia coli in a coastal waterway located in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla,, were evaluated. The study consisted of an extensive program of field measurements designed to capture spatial and temporal variations in E. coli concentrations as well as experiments conducted under laboratory-controlled conditions. E. coli from environmental samples was enumerated by using a defined substrate technology (Colilert-18), Field sampling tasks included sampling the length of the North Fork to identify the river reach contributing high E. coli levels, autosampler experiments at two locations, and spatially intense sampling efforts at hot spots. Laboratory experiments were designed to simulate tidal conditions within the riverbank soils. The results showed that E. coli entered the river in a large pulse during storm conditions. After the storm, E. coli levels returned to baseline levels and varied in a cyclical pattern which correlated with tidal cycles. The highest concentrations were observed during high tide, whereas the lowest were observed at tom tide. This peculiar pattern of E. coli concentrations between storm events was caused by the growth of E. coli within riverbank soils which were subsequently washed in during high tide. Laboratory analysis of soil collected from the riverbanks showed increases of several orders of magnitude in soil E. coli concentrations. The ability of E. coli to multiply in the soil was found to be a function of soil moisture content, presumably due to the ability of E, coli to outcompete predators in relatively dry soil. The importance of soil moisture in regulating the multiplication of E. coli was found to be critical in tidally influenced areas due to periodic wetting and drying of soils in contact with water bodies. Given the potential for growth in such systems, E. coli concentrations can be artificially elevated above that expected from fecal impacts alone. Such results challenge the use of E. coli as a suitable indicator of water quality in tidally influenced areas located within tropical and subtropical environments.

For this, the quantity epsilon, epsilon = Delta sigma/(sigma(a) + Delta sigma/2), where Delta sigma is the static stress drop, proposed by ZUNIGA (1993) as an indicator of stress-drop mechanism was used. The events induced at the URL are characterized by low values of epsilon corresponding to a partial stress drop mechanism, whereas all the events at WDL display a frictional overshoot mechanism in which final stress reaches a lower value than that of frictional stress. The events at Polish coal and copper mines, on the other hand, are in good agreement with the well-known Orowan's condition such that the final stress is equal to the dynamic frictional stress.
   The Prune stress drop, however, is heavily model dependent through the source radius-corner frequency relation. The Orowan's condition for the events from the URL would be met if a constant in the source radius-corner frequency relation is equal to 1.82 +/- 0.12, and for the events from WDL if it is equal to 3.92 +/- 0.40, in contrast to Prune's constant of 2.34.
   The smoothed values of epsilon displayed as a function of time, represented by the consecutive event numbers, for selected sets of events imply that the largest seismic events in a given set occur when the epsilon is low and a partial stress drop mechanism is dominant. The large events are then followed by high epsilon values when a frictional overshoot mechanism begins to dominate.

AB  - The cat can be profitably used for chronobiological studies of sleep-wakefulness and other physiological circadian rhythms. Four stages of the sleep-wakefulness cycle have been described In this animal Wakefulness (W). Slow Wave Sleep I (SWS I) Slow Wave Sleep II (SWS II) and Rapid Eyes Movement Sleep (REM) Convincing sleep-wakefulness rhythms had not previously been well-established for this animal mainly regarding environmental Indicators as the light-dark cycles. The purpose of this study was to identify and to describe the temporal distribution of the sleep-wakefulness cycle in the cat an 23 hours recording under Light-Dark (L-D) 12:12 hours and Dark-Light (D-L) 12:12 hours conditions. Eight freely-moving adult male cats chronically implanted for conventional sleep recording were studied. All animals underwent 23 hour sleep recordings twice a week starting at 8:30 am. Four cats were recorded in D-L and four in L-D cycle, a total 50 recordings were obtained. The following variables were analyzed, sleep stages number (NF), duration percentage (%), duration average ((x) over bar) and total time (TT) of each hour. Periods from 0-12 hours and from 12-23 hours were analyzed under light and dark conditions, Results showed that the sleep total time predominates in the 0-12 hours periods. Significant differences did not appear between light and dark periods regarding NF, %, (x) over bar and TT in all stags. Aumented REM sleep % under the light period of the L-D cycle was an exception. Temporal distribution of SWS I and SWS II did not show significant differences in the hour by hour analyses The REM sleep ocurrence had inverse relation with W stage. The results show that the REM sleep ocurrence is related to the W decrease The sleep-wakefulness cycle In the cat is not strictly related to light and dark periods, nevertheless is reinforced in L-D cycle.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to assess the possibility of decreasing the chosen environmental indicators like energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) production and other exhaust pollutants in the selected region in Slovakia by introducing Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) buses into bus transport. The assessment is carried out by comparing the consumption and emissions of current buses (EURO 2) in real operation, with potential buses (EURO 6) and with pilot LNG buses testing on the same lines. Comparison took place under the same conditions over the same period. The study measures the energy consumption and GHG production per bus. The research paper also compares two methodologies of calculation. The first calculation is according to the European Standard EN 16258: 2012 which specifies the general methodology for evaluation and declaration of energy consumption and GHG emissions (all services - cargo, passengers or both). The second calculation is according to the Handbook of Emission Factors for Road Transport (HBEFA). The results of the calculation are compared by both methods, and the most suitable version of the bus in terms of GHG emissions is proposed.

AB  - The degradation of the permafrost regions, resulting from intensive anthropogenic activities and global warming, has led to the loss of ecosystem services and is threating human well-being. Nevertheless, the real ecosystem service values and their complete zoning system in the permafrost regions have received insufficient attention. Research gaps between the identification of permafrost-based ecosystem services and ecosystem management are seriously constraining the development of cryospheric science. Thus, an ecosystem service zoning framework that links ecosystem services with human welfares is proposed to solve the abovementioned challenges in the permafrost regions of China. The threetiered zoning framework for ecosystem services, consisting of zoning goals, principles, hierarchy, methodology, and nomenclature, is proposed for the permafrost regions of China. A combined method, i.e., GIS spatial tools, the location entropy analysis model, and ecosystem services assessment, was employed to distinguish ecosystem conditions, ecosystem service supply, and beneficiaries into these three-grade ecosystem service zones. Hierarchical and dynamic zoning could clarify protection priorities of ecosystems and ecosystem services in terms of regions, grades, and types. The framework could contribute to sustainable management of ecosystem services in the cryosphere.

AB  - Ancient woodlands in Europe are currently subjected to fragmentation, which leads to ecological deterioration and genetic isolation. This is likely to intensify with further climate change and increased land use. Tilia are keystone, ancient woodland indicators, represented in the UK by two species (Tilia cordata and Tilia platyphyllos) and their hybrid (Tilia x europaea). For management of the species, we need to investigate genetic differentiation and population genetic structure. Morphology can usually separate the two species but the distinguishing features are not always observable, particularly in less optimum, shady, conditions. Here, we test for the first time 13 microsatellite markers to discriminate the species and hybrid, and to assess the population genetic diversity of the two species. The markers successfully distinguished the species and hybrid. The two species show significant genetic differentiation, indicating two distinct biological units. Sub-structure within both species is loosely related to geographic location. Because Tilia populations in the UK are highly fragmented, future conservation should consider provenance issues.

AB  - The high demand of fuels and the problems associated with the resources depletion and environmental effects of its production have motivated the search for alternative sources. An interesting option in Spain is the cultivation of Cynara cardunculus as primary raw material of biodiesel manufacture. In this paper, the environmental feasibility of the value chain form cropping to fuel manufacture is studied for Cynara cardunculus oil (CCB) and compared to rapeseed oil (RSB) through life cycle assessment, according to the ISO Standard 14040 and using the Gabi software v4.3 as calculation tool. The functional unit selected was 1 tonne of biodiesel. The total energy consumption and the energy return on energy investment (EROEI) were calculated from energy balance. The indicators for life cycle assessment corresponding to impact categories in human health, ecosystem quality and resources depletion were estimated by means of Ecoindicator 99 method. Obtained EROEI values (calculated considering only the calorific power of the oil) indicate that the energy balance is more positive for Cynara cardunculus than for rapeseed (EROEI = 1.53 for CCB and 1.20 for RSB). Moreover, biodiesel from cardoon shows lower environmental impacts.

AB  - The acidification of forest soils and surface waters and their relatively poor recovery record following reductions in atmospheric sulphur emissions is a major ongoing environmental problem, particularly in northeastern North America. The slow recovery of surface water is widely hypothesized to result from depletion of reservoirs of base cations in soil. This is concordant with the theory that the acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) of lakes is likely proportional to (he size of the exchangeable base cation reservoirs present in surrounding watershed soils. However, data describing these linkages are still nonexistent in the literature. Here we show that lake ANC is highly predictable (r(2) = 0.75) based on the size of the exchangeable Ca2+ reservoir in soil in 21 catchments representative of soil and lake conditions encountered in northeastern North America. This finding indirectly supports the hypothesis that the poor recovery of surface water from acidification is governed by the size of base cation reservoirs present in catchment soils. The size of the base cation reservoir in soil is thus a strong indicator of the acid-base status of both soils and surface waters.

AB  - A comparison of a constructed tidal marsh with two adjacent natural tidal marshes was conducted.  The marshes were sampled for fish, shellfish, benthic infauna, marsh surface utilization, vegetation community type, stem density and cover, salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, organic carbon, bird utilization, and zooplankton.  The proximity of study sites permitted simultaneous sampling to test for marsh preference by fish and shellfish.  Subsurface organic carbon, Spartina alterniflora stem density, low marsh zone surface utilization, zooplankton abundance and bird nesting sites were all greater in the natural marshes.  Other attributes such as stem density of the high marsh, high marsh zone surface utilization, surface organic carbon, and benthic infauna community structure and abundance were similar between the constructed and natural marshes.  Seasonal differences were observed for fish and shellfish abundance between the constructed and natural marshes.  The study is among the first to use simultaneous sampling techniques to investigate fish and shellfish use between constructed and adjacent natural reference wetlands.

AB  - There is an emerging consensus among academics and resource managers that successful resource management systems must be developed locally and account for a diverse range of political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental factors. In this research we evaluate and categorize the fishers' perspectives on the environmental, economic, social, and legal impacts of transitioning from a private property system to community fisheries in Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake. Specifically, this paper uses interview results (N= 523) to assess the perceptions of local communities following a reform in 2012, whereby a commercial leasehold system was replaced with a community-based fishery management system. Results demonstrate that this conversion of fishery management systems is perceived as helping to improve economic, environmental, and legal conditions at the macro-level, but improvements in economic productivity at the individual level are inconclusive. This paper reveals the inherent complexity, benefits, and trade-offs involved in community-based management by exploring fishers' perceptions. One implication of this study is that the data reinforce the importance of participatory engagement in the development of resource management systems.

AB  - This study evaluates the energy and environmental performance of a cogeneration system operating simultaneously with bagasse and straw in a rankine cycle. Different process conditions, defined in terms of boiler operating pressure, moisture content and straw addition rate, were analyzed. The combination of these parameters led to the elaboration of one hundred and twenty-five analysis scenarios. The energy profile was based on the energy performance indicator, which is the ratio between the exported electricity and the intrinsic energy of biomass consumed for its generation, and the environmental assessment was performed in terms of climate change. Scenario modeling was developed according to the conceptual framework proposed by the life cycle assessment technique with a 'from cradle-to-gate' coverage. Results indicate that the best energy and environmental performances (energy performance indicator = 0.193 and 688 kg CO2eq/MWh) were obtained with the highest pressure (100 bar) and addition rate (50%), and the lowest moisture content (10%). Moreover, straw moisture has more influence on the system environmental performance than its addition rate.

AB  - From a philosophical point of view, this study discusses the dialectical relationship between the development of energy and mineral resources and the ecological conservation redline. We propose that the ecological conservation redline and the development of energy and mineral resources should be guided by ecological civilization construction, that is, the energy and mineral resources should be rationally developed under the condition that the ecological environment is protected. This study analyzes the influence of the development of energy and mineral resources on the ecological environment. The handling of mining rights within the ecological conservation redline based on the law and the reduction of the influence of the development of energy mineral resources on the ecological environment by science and technology are presented. The environmental assessment system and technical standards for energy and mineral development are suggested to implement policies and measures for the disposal of mining rights within the redline and facilitate technological innovations of ecological conservation for energy and mineral development. Hence, a coordinated development between the ecological conservation redline and the development of energy and mineral resources can be promoted.

AB  - Irrigation practices have imposed the salinity stress in cultivated areas which resultantly inhibiting the crop productivity. Chickpea is also being grown under versatile environmental conditions across the region. Stability of the genotypic performance across different environments is indicator of tolerance against subjected stress. In current research experiment, agronomic and biological stability of chickpea genotypes was evaluated against different artificial saline environments. GGE biplot analysis was used for identification of stable performance of chickpea genotypes based on morphometric, physiological and biochemical markers. Chickpea genotypes were found to be negatively affected by salinity stress at early growth stages but magnitude of responses was different across the genotypes which have indicated the differential levels of genotype into environment interactions. Genotype 6009 was found biologically stable for chlorophyll contents, relative water contents and growth related parameters while genotype 6003 was biologically stable for relative water contents, Na+ concentration, K+ concentration and growth related traits. Venhar-2000, Bital-98 and Noor-2009 showed agronomic stability and recommended for further progression, manipulation and improvisation against salinity stress for better productivity.

AB  - A study on Trace Elements (TE) from sea urchin gonads has been conducted in the western Mediterranean Sea. Contamination data were used to determine a Trace Method Pollution Index (TEPI). TE concentrations varied considerably depending on the location of the sampling stations. The results showed that five trace elements (Zn, Fe, As, Al, Cu) are ubiquitous. The geographical area considered (Corsica) represents an important range of environmental conditions and types of pressure that can be found in the western Mediterranean Sea. TEN was used to classify the studied sites according to their degree of contamination and allowed reliable comparison of TE contamination between local and international sites. TE contamination of the western Mediterranean Sea displayed a north-to-south gradient, from the Italian coasts down through the insular Corsican coasts to the north African littoral. Due to the increasing environmental pressure on the Mediterranean Sea, a regular monitoring of TE levels in marine organisms is necessary to prevent any further environmental deterioration.

AB  - Betta splendens is an extremely popular ornamental fish among hobby aquarists. It has an interesting behavioral repertoire, particularly where male aggression and territoriality are concerned. The lack of scientific studies investigating optimal housing conditions in combination with the wide variety of commercially available husbandry products, raises questions about the welfare status of these fish in captivity. In this article, an overview of the available literature on the biology of the betta and general considerations of ornamental fish keeping is given, and environment- and animal-related factors with potential impact on the welfare of Betta splendens are examined. Although more research using biological and physiological indicators is needed, the following factors constituting welfare problems have been identified: an aquarium of limited dimensions, prevalence of Mycobacterium spp. infection, aggression to and from conspecifics or other species in the same aquarium and the limited ability to escape, potential for stress due to prolonged visual contact between males in shops and during shows, and the lack of environmental enrichment in the form of sheltering vegetation.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate the seasonal relationship of macrobenthos richness and abundance with sediment characteristics (i.e. texture and organic material) for the coastal Budi Lagoon in southern Chile. Physicochemical measurements and macrobenthos samples were taken over the course of a year at nine sampling stations. Sandy-muddy sediment was the most common, and high percentages of organic material were registered, varying significantly between seasons and stations. The recorded organic material was related to natural (resident wild birds) and anthropogenic (agriculture) sources. Regarding fauna, 28 benthonic taxa and 7092 individuals were identified, with temporal and spatial variations. The most abundant taxa year-round were the molluscs Littoridina cumingii and Kingiella chilenica and the bristle worm Prionospio patagonica. Together, the obtained results evidence the important impact of organic material on the macrobenthos, with macrobenthic richness and abundance decreasing in conditions of high organic material content. The recorded variations for different taxa may indicate a response to the land use around the Budi Lagoon, which is intensely subjected to agricultural and tourist activities.

AB  - The accumulative partitioning of the heavy metals Cu, Pb and Zn in the grey mangrove, Avicennia marina, were studied under field conditions. Copper and Pb were accumulated in root tissue to levels higher than surrounding sediment levels. Zinc was accumulated to levels reflecting sediment concentrations. Strong linear relationships existed for all metals in sediments with metals in root tissue. Accumulation of Cu in leaf tissue followed a linear relationship at lower sediment concentrations, with an exclusion or saturation mechanism at higher sediment concentrations. Lead showed little mobility to leaf tissue. Zn showed restricted accumulation in leaf tissue, which correlated with sediment concentrations. Decreases in sediment pH were found to increase Zn accumulation to root tissue. Increasing concentrations of Pb and Zn in sediments resulted in a greater accumulation of Pb to both root and leaf tissue. A. marina roots may be employed as a biological indicator of environmental exposure of Cu, Pb and Zn and leaves for Zn, with temporal monitoring. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Calcium (Ca2+) imaging aims at investigating the dynamic changes in live cells of its concentration ([Ca2+]) in different pathophysiological conditions. Ca2+ is an ubiquitous and versatile intracellular signal that modulates a large variety of cellular functions thanks to a cell type-specific toolkit and a complex subcellular compartmentalization.
   Many Ca2+ sensors are presently available (chemical and genetically encoded) that can be specifically targeted to different cellular compartments. Using these probes, it is now possible to monitor Ca2+ dynamics of living cells not only in the cytosol but also within specific organelles. The choice of a specific sensor depends on the experimental design and the spatial and temporal resolution required.
   Here we describe the use of novel Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) -based fluorescent Ca2+ probes to dynamically and quantitatively monitor the changes in cytosolic and mitochondrial [Ca2+] in a variety of cell types and experimental conditions. FRET-based sensors have the enormous advantage of being ratiometric, a feature that makes them particularly suitable for quantitative and in vivo applications.

AB  - Setting up the working stages in forest operations is conditioned by environmental protection and forest health requirements. This paper exposes a method for improving the decision-making process by choosing the most environmentally effective logging systems according to terrain configuration and stand characteristics. Such a methodology for selecting machines or logging systems accounting for environment, safety as well as economics, becomes mandatory in the context of sustainable management of forest with multiple functions.
   Based on analytic hierarchy process analysis the following classification of the environmental performance for four considered alternatives was obtained: skyline system (42.43%), forwarder system (20.22%), skidder system (19.92%) and horse logging system (17.43%).
   Further, an environmental risk matrix for the most important 28 risk factors specific to any work equipment used in forest operations was produced. In the end, a multicriterial analysis generated a risk index RI ranging between 1.0 and 3.5, which could help choosing the optimal combination of logging system and logging equipment with low environmental impact.
   In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed' approach, a simple application in specific conditions of a harvesting site is presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Songbirds sing complex songs as a result of evolution through sexual selection. The evolution of such sexually selected traits requires genetic control, as well as selection on their expression. Song is controlled by a discrete neural pathway in the brain, and song complexity has been shown to correlate with the volume of specific song control nuclei. As such, the development of these nuclei, in particular the high vocal centre (HVC), is thought to be the mechanism controlling signal expression indicating male quality. We tested the hypothesis that early developmental stress selectively affects adult HVC size, compared with other brain nuclei. We did this by raising cross-fostered zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) under stressed and controlled conditions and determining the effect on adult HVC size. Our results confirm the strong influence of environmental conditions, particularly on HVC development, and therefore on the expression of complex songs. The results also show that both environmental and genetic factors affect the development of several brain nuclei, highlighting the developmental plasticity of the songbird brain. In all, these results explain how the complex song repertoires of songbirds can evolve as honest indicators of male quality.

AB  - Many chemicals have recently been demonstrated to possess estrogenic activity and may potentially interfere with normal sexual development. In the present study, we quantified the effects of waterborne exposure to 17beta-estradiol on the gonopodial development and sexual activity of male eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). Juvenile males were exposed during the period of sexual maturation to nominal concentrations of 20, 100, and 500 ng/L of 17beta-estradiol and a solvent control (0.00003% w/v ethanol) for 84 d under continuous-flow conditions. Following exposure, significant differences were found among the test treatments with respect to gonopodial length and degree of gonopodial elongation of the fish. Sexual activity, measured as the number of approaches and copulatory attempts made by the exposed males to nonexposed females, also significantly decreased with increasing concentrations of 17beta-estradiol. Because the degree of gonopodial maturation and frequency of sexual activity are important characteristics for the reproductive success of male mosquitofish, it is suggested that these traits provide sensitive and ecologically relevant endpoints for assessing estrogenic activity under both laboratory-and field-exposure conditions.

AB  - Simple Summary
   To determine the level of welfare on a dairy farm is a complex task. There is no protocol available that can serve as a 'gold standard'. The Welfare Quality protocol is the most extensive one, but it takes about a full day to perform. We, therefore, examined if it would be possible to replace the time-consuming parts, like lengthy behavioural observations, with simple measurements in the environment. This resulted in a new Welfare Monitor that can be executed in 1.5 h on a farm with 100 cows. Welfare assessment was appreciated by the farmers, and they responded to advice for improvements on their farm. Besides promoting better welfare, this approach also led to a better financial result for the farms.
   The Welfare Quality(R) assessment protocol (WQ) is the most extensive way to measure animal welfare. This study was set up to determine if resource-based welfare indicators, that are easier and faster to measure, could replace the more time consuming, animal-based measurements of the WQ. The WQ was applied on 60 dairy farms in the Netherlands, with good, moderate and poor welfare. The WQ protocol classified most farms (87%) as 'acceptable'. Several of the animal-based measures of WQ correlated well with measures in the environment. Using these correlations, an alternative welfare assessment protocol (new Welfare Monitor) was designed, which takes approximately 1.5 h for a farm with 100 dairy cows. Because the opinion of farmers about welfare assessment is important if one wants to improve conditions for the cows at a farm, another objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the new Welfare Monitor for the farmer. Over two years, the farms were visited, and advice was given to improve the conditions at the farm. After the first welfare assessment and advice, farmers improved the conditions for their cows substantially. Farms where the category score had increased made more improvements on average than those that did not upgrade.

AB  - Extracellular phosphatase activity (PA) has been used as an overall indicator of P depletion in lake phytoplankton. However, detailed insights into the mechanisms of PA regulation are still limited, especially in the case of acid phosphatases. The novel substrate ELF97 phosphate allows for tagging PA on single cells in an epifluorescence microscope. This fluorescence-labeled enzyme activity (FLEA) assay enables for autecological studies in natural phytoplankton and algal cultures. We combined the FLEA assay with image analysis to measure cell-specific acid PA in two closely related species of the genus Coccomyxa (Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta) isolated from two acidic lakes with distinct P availability. The strains were cultured in a mineral medium supplied with organic (beta-glycerol phosphate) or inorganic (orthophosphate) P at three concentrations. Both strains responded to experimental conditions in a similar way, suggesting that acid extracellular phosphatases were regulated irrespectively of the origin and history of the strains. We found an increase in cell-specific PA at low P concentration and the cultures grown with organic P produced significantly higher (ca. 10-fold) PA than those cultured with the same concentrations of inorganic P. The cell-specific PA measured in the cultures grown with the lowest organic P concentration roughly corresponded to those of the original Coccomyxa population from an acidic lake with impaired P availability. The ability of Coccomyxa strains to produce extracellular phosphatases, together with tolerance for both low pH and metals can be one of the factors enabling the dominance of the genus in extreme conditions of acidic lakes. The analysis of frequency distribution of the single-cell PA documented that simple visual counting of 'active' (labeled) and 'non-active' (non-labeled) cells can lead to biased conclusions regarding algal P status because the actual PA of the 'active' cells can vary from negligible to very high values. The FLEA assay using image cytometry offers a strong tool in plankton ecology for exploring P metabolism.

AB  - Two cores were recovered from raised peat bogs on the tropical northern Leizhou Peninsula, south China. Multiple sediment variables including organic matter (OM) content, the stable carbon isotope signature of OM, low-frequency magnetic susceptibility and degree of humification, indicate that the regional paleoclimate played an important role in determining the nature of peat that accumulated. Based on comparison with other climate proxies, the bulk peat delta C-13 record was interpreted as an indicator of variation in the East Asian (EA) summer monsoon, and to a lesser extent, the Indian summer monsoon, during the last glacial period between similar to 49 and 10 cal ka BP. More negative bulk delta C-13 values reflect wetter and warmer conditions, and thus a strong EA summer monsoon. More positive values indicate drier and cooler conditions. A warm and wet period occurred between similar to 46 and 28 cal ka BP, implying a strengthening of the EA summer monsoon. A climate shift occurred at similar to 22 cal ka BP and the driest and coldest period appeared between similar to 19 and 16 cal ka BP, suggesting weakening of the EA summer monsoon. After similar to 12 cal ka BP, climate shifted towards wetter and warmer conditions again. It has been suggested that variations in orbitally induced solar insolation played a role in the last glacial climate of the study region. Several millennial-scale arid and cold phases characterized by C4 plants, or by more positive delta C-13 values during periods when C3 plants dominated, show agreement with the Greenland GISP2 ice core and the Chinese stalagmite records. Interactions between high northern latitude cold air advection and summer moisture transported across the tropical ocean, and the migration of the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) would have favored these millennial-scale phases. Additionally, changes in heat transport to the North Atlantic would also have influenced climate in the region.

AB  - Quantitative evaluation of renewable energy systems' techno-economic performance is important but difficult, because the resource condition, investment of system, and subsidy policy vary from place to place. This study aims to develop a normalized techno-economic index to synthesize all the factors. The optimization of solar and wind energy system is realized by simulating the long-term implementation, and a normalized techno-economic index is developed by using the mathematical normalization method to synthesize these numerical results. The normalized index we proposed mainly considers 6 independent economic and environmental indicators, especially the carbon dioxide emission which was not considered in previous work and was also added into the calculation of the index. This index can be widely applied around the world, irrespective of geographic location and system type. Taking 16 cities of Shandong province with typical temperate monsoon climate as research locations where are abundant of solar and wind energy resources, we present the evaluation strategies of normalized techno-economic index. The results show that the wind power system has great advantages in most cities in Shandong. Under this climatic condition, wind system is more economical than photovoltaic system.

AB  - The future European Common Agricultural Policy foresees Strategic National Plans founded on recognised needs for intervention and indicators in order to select the more effective policy measures. The Strategic plans start from a "context analysis", describing the current-starting conditions. In support to the policy theme on climate change, the authors proposed a context analysis on the main agrometeorological variables and weather extreme events, both at national and subnational (NUTS1) level. This paper describes the methodological choices made and the results obtained, considering the contents required by the European Commission for the context analysis (agrometeorological indicators and an indicator of economic damages due to natural disasters). The data source chosen is ERA5, the climate reanalysis dataset produced within the Copernicus project. The study demonstrates the importance of cross-reading data on hazards and data on vulnerability for policy decisions. In particular this is shown for the resulted most impacting weather condition: the drought, measured through the SPEI index, affecting all the country. There are also other hazards frequent and quite impacting, first of all heavy rain. Further improvements of the analysis are programmed in terms of spatial scale, time scale (seasonal approach) and in terms of correlation hazard-vulnerability.

AB  - The paper presents the impact of periodic soil drought on physiological parameters important for bioproductivity of mountain beech populations. The investigated forest population was located near Fruska gora mountain peak, where water runs off quickly, and consequently lack of soil humidity develops very often. Decreasing trends of photosynthesis, transpiration, water use efficiency and stomatal conductance (gs) during the growing season were evident, in correlation with a shortage of precipitation. Diurnally, photosynthesis of beech leaves showed rhythmical changes. It was the most intensive in the morning, then decreased between noon and 1 pm, and increased again during early afternoon. High leaf temperature and water deficit in the deeper soil layers caused a decreasing trend in photosynthesis and daily rhythmic changes of the transpiration rate and water use efficiency. Although surface soil water capacity did not show a significant decreasing trend from July to September, a lack of precipitation was observed, which probably caused a lack of moisture in deeper soil layers, resulting in a decline in photosynthesis and transpiration. Physiological status, linked to primary photosynthetic productivity of forests, could be a significant indicator of environmental conditions and trends in climate changes.

AB  - The Western Australian Rangeland Monitoring System (WARMS), a state government monitoring activity, provides information on change in Western Australia's pastoral rangelands. It consists of a set of permanent sites, on which measurements of perennial vegetation (direct census in shrublands and perennial grass frequency and woody cover in grasslands) and assessments of soil surface condition are recorded at either 3-year (grasslands) or 5-year (shrublands) intervals. Data collection is non-destructive. Site distribution is based on vegetation type, and WARMS reports at the vegetation type or regional level, not individual site or property level.
   Operating WARMS requires a range of defined conventions to ensure that personnel changes and the interval between samplings at any one site do not lead to confounding of results through variation in how data are collected. The number of sites (1622) and program timeframe (decadal) mean that data storage and management issues are critical. Data interpretation, including the interpretive framework and use of ancillary data to assist in interpreting causality, and provision of information products relevant to a range of users are also important operational aspects. A companion paper addresses the institutional requirements for WARMS, system design and the rationale behind this design.

FX  - It is to be expected in a program with its roots in the 1970s that numerous people contributed to the development of WARMS. These include, but are not restricted to those responsible for its initiation, science and development (Peter Curry, George Gardiner, John Morrissey, Alec Holm, Ron Hacker and David Wilcox) and those who have (and in some cases continue to) toil tirelessly over the years to collect, analyse, interpret and extend the data (Jim Addison, Richard Allen, David Beurle, Don Burnside, Andrew Craig, Geoff Eliot, Matthew Fletcher, Wayne Fletcher, Casey Griffiths, Dave Hadden, Tricia Handasyde, Bernie Kok, Lloyd Morey, Kerry McCarthy, Bob McCartney, Andrew Mitchell, Kevin Shackleton, Val Shrubb, Kerry Skinner, Sarah Strutt and Sarah Wyatt). Obviously, some have worked in both roles. Earlier drafts of this paper were considerably improved by the comments of John Ludwig, Lamar Smith and Alec Holm, and Wal Whalley, as editor of The Rangeland Journal, further improved the manuscript. WARMS is a core funded activity of the Department of Agriculture and Food, Western Australia.

AB  - Climate and its long-term variability govern ground thermal conditions, and for this reason represent one of the most important impacts on creeping mountain permafrost. The decoding and better understanding of the present-day morphology and distribution of rock glaciers opens up a variety of insights into past and present environmental, especially climatic, conditions on a local to regional scale. The present study was carried out in the Swiss Alps using two different approaches: (1) kinematic analysis of specific active rock glaciers, and (2) description of the altitudinal distribution of relict rock glaciers. Two theoretical shape concepts of active rock-glacier morphology were derived: a "monomorphic" type, representing presumably undisturbed, continuous development over several millennia, and a "polymorphic" type, reflecting a system of (possibly climatically affected) individual creep streams several centuries old. The topoclimatic-based inventory analysis indicated an average temperature increase at relict rock-glacier fronts of approximately +2 degreesC since the time of their decay, which is a sign of rock-glacier ages reaching back to the Alpine Late Glacial. The temperature difference of some tenths of a degree Celsius found for active/inactive rock glaciers is typical for the bandwidth of Holocene climate variations. These results confirm the importance of Alpine rock glaciers as highly sensitive indicators of past temperature evolution.

AB  - The development of practical field criteria for timing water application is required to improve crop productivity. The most simple physiological indicator of plant water status is the predawn leaf wafer potential. For several annual crops, this indicator is representative of relative evapotranspiration. The same correlation between relative evapotranspiration and predawn water potential is also found with young trees in containers. However, exceptions can occur for heterogeneous soil distributions of water content To examine this condition, a split-root experiment was performed with two compartments (20 and 80% of the total available soil volume respectively). Predawn and minimal stem wafer potential, sap flow, variation in trunk diameter were measured for control frees (two compartments irrigated) and stessed trees (one small compartment irrigated; 20% of total volume). The experiment showed that the predawn water potentials of the control (two compartments irrigated) and of the treatment (one compartment irrigated) do not differ significantly, while sap flow and variation in diameter clearly indicate stress. This experiment has been compared with drought treatment in homogeneous soil. We conclude that under this particuliar condition of heterogeneous soil water content distribution the use of this indicator is very questionable.

AB  - The objective of this study is to understand the effect of indoor air stability on personal exposure to infectious contaminant in the breathing zone. Numerical simulations are carried out in a test chamber with a source of infectious contaminant and a manikin (Manikin A). To give a good visual illustration of the breathing zone, the contaminant source is visualized by the mouth of another manikin. Manikin A is regarded as a vulnerable individual to infectious contaminant. Exposure index and exposure intensity are used as indicators of the exposure level in the breathing zone. The results show that in the stable condition, the infectious contaminant proceeds straightly towards the breathing zone of the vulnerable individual, leading to a relatively high exposure level. In the unstable condition, the indoor air experiences a strong mixing due to the heat exchange between the hot bottom air and the cool top air, so the infectious contaminant disperses effectively from the breathing zone. The unstable air can greatly reduce personal exposure to the infectious contaminant in the breathing zone. This study demonstrates the importance of indoor air stability on personal exposure in the indoor environment and provides a new direction for future study of personal exposure reduction in the indoor environment.

AB  - In Asia, Europe and South America, the role of atmospheric condition in aiding or abating the growth curve of COVID-19 has been analysed. However, no study to date has examined such climatic extensions for the growth or otherwise of the novel coronavirus in Africa. Africa, with a mostly relatively warmer temperature differs from other regions of the world and in addition, has recorded far fewer cases compared to Asian, Europeans and the Americans (North and South). It then becomes imperative to examine the influence of meteorological indices in the growth or otherwise of coronavirus diseases in Africa to establish whether findings on the climatic conditionsCOVID-19 growth are regionally specific. In this study, we examined the influence of meteorological factors for aiding or abating the spread of the aerosolised pathogen of COVID-19 in Africa. We rely on the generalised additive model (GAM) and found wind speed to positively relate to COVID-19 growth while mean temperature and relative humidity to inversely relates to COVID-19 growth curve in Africa. We accounted for potential cofounders in the core GAM model and discuss policy implications.

AB  - This article presents the results of the assessment of genetic diversity, genetic structure and differentiation of Scots pine in the conditions of Orenburg Zauralye using intermicrosatellite analysis of DNA polymorphism (markers of 14 isoenzyme loci from the enzyme systems aspartate aminotransferase, glutamate dehydrogenase, leucine neuropathy, and others).
   In the studied populations of Scots pine, 51 alleles were detected by the studied molecular genetic markers, most of which were common. The frequency of occurrence of these alleles varied significantly everywhere: 62.7% of allelic variants are rare or relatively rare (frequency of occurence is less than 5%). The indicator of the genetic diversity of Scots pine is influenced by the natural and climatic conditions and geographical isolation, resulting in a greater genetic diversity in the population of Karagai forest.
   The study of the division of the genetic diversity of Scots pine showed a high level of population genetic diversity and a low degree of divergence in the studied populations: 5.1% accounted for the interpopulation component. Determination of the genetic distance of Nei showed that the populations are closely related. This figure was 0.024. Analysis of allelic diversity indicates a high stability and reliability of the population of Scots pine and its evolutionary perspective.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare the physical, chemical and biological parameters and the microbiological quality of bee-pollen samples treated with different dehydration processes and to correlate the results. The samples came mainly from Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae) and Eupatorium (Asteraceae) plants. The dehydration conditions of the samples influenced the L*a*b* colour parameters and the biological value. Unlike the protein and lipid content, the glucose and fructose content were unaffected. The vitamin E content (27.2 +/- 0.3 mu g/g 27.5 +/- 0.4 mu g/g) in oven-dehydrated samples with forced air circulation was significantly lower (P < 0.05) compared with lyophilized samples (37.5 +/- 0.2 g/100 g, 53.7 +/- 3.9 g/100 g). Overall, the results were inconclusive for vitamin B complex, minerals and microbiological indicators. There was a positive correlation between the colour parameters L* and b* and the total phenolic content, as well as between phenolic content and the antioxidant and antimicrobial capacity. The data indicate that lyophilization might be a viable alternative to the current process, resulting in dehydrated bee-pollen with higher biological activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrogen bond donor/acceptor mixed-solvent systems for solutes that exhibit strong specific interactions are not readily characterized with methods that depend On solvatochromic parameters. In this work; the reaction of two monomers, 4,4'-oxidianiline (ODA) and pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA), to form the common engineering plastic precursor, poly(amic acid) (PAA), are studied for the tetrahydrofuran (THF) mixed-solvent Systems (THF-methanol, THF-ethanol, THF-water) with spectroscopy. Solute-centric (SC) Kamlet-Taft solvatochromic (K-T) parameters for the solvent environment around the monomer are determined using a proposed model that incorporates spectroscopically determined local composition (X-L) around the ODA monomer and the preferential solvation Model. For the example reaction to occur under homogeneous conditions, mixed solvent conditions need have I-IBA-rich local compositions (0.30 < X-HBA(L) < 0.83); high solute-centric basicity (beta(SC) > 0.60), high Solute-centric polarity, (pi(SC)* > 0.63), and low solute-centric acidity (alpha(SC) < 0.63). The method developed allows characterization of mixed-solvent effects and can be readily extended to other systems that have strong specific interactions.

AB  - The dioxin isomer 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TeCDD) has been reported as the deadliest compound known to science. Due to its highly recalcitrant nature and low bioavailability, it is stubborn toward bioremediation and chemical treatment. Efforts to degrade it using one single technique have not accomplished the desired results. In this study, we have tried to develop an integrated 2,3,7,8-TeCDD removal process using palladized iron nanoparticles (Pd/nFe) for initial reductive dechlorination under anoxic conditions and subsequent oxidative biomineralization. Using laboratory synthesized Pd/nFe, 2,3,7,8-TeCDD was completely dechlorinated to form the end product dibenzo-p-dioxin (DD). Oxidative degradation of DD was successfully achieved by growing active cells of a dioxin-degrading microorganism Sphingomonas wittichii RW1 (DSM 6014) under aerobic culture conditions. Metabolite identification was done by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and whole cell protein was measured as the indicator for cell growth. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on integrated hybrid degradation method for 2,3,7,8-TeCDD. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work was aimed at evaluating the contribution of intensive rabbit breeding to sustainable development using a semi-quantitative method. Nine sustainability indicators were defined for the environmental (energy use, antibiotic use, and biodiversity), economic (profit, specialisation rate, and transmissibility) and social scales of sustainable development. A score (-1, 0 or +1) was given for each indicator using data from French rabbit farms (12,000 farms for economic results and 100 farms for social and environmental data). Scores were added within each scale to obtain a final score. It was revealed from the data analysis that intensive rabbit breeding had some negative contributions to sustainable development, due to the high cost of indirect energy, high use of antibiotics, low biodiversity and little respect for animal welfare, in particular in the scale of environmental sustainability (total score: -2). But it also had positive contributions to sustainable development, particularly in the economic and social scales (total score: +1 each). Indeed, the mean profit, life and working conditions were good and the rabbit meat is of good quality. Therefore, the challenge for rabbit production will be to manage the lawful development and to face the market trends while preserving the maximum of its advantages.

AB  - Lake Naivasha is a shallow freshwater lake in the Rift Valley of Kenya. Since the 1980s, when the lake showed a seasonal shift between diatom and cyanobacterial dominance it has become moderately eutrophic. Its algal assemblage is now dominated by a persistent Aulacoseira italica population both numerically and in terms of contribution to overall primary production. Algal and cyanobacterial counts were used to derive Simpson's diversity, succession rate and total community succession, focusing on the 10 most numerically abundant taxa. 170 species were identified, 43 of which were in common with the 143 found in 1979 - 80, before the increase in trophic state. Most diatoms are indicators of moderate to high nutrient conditions. There is little horizontal or vertical variation in successional processes throughout the lake and although the absolute abundance of cells varies widely, proportional composition is relatively stable. In Crescent Island lagoon, the only regularly stratified site, hypolimnetic succession rates are lower than those in the epilimnion. Overall, community composition is controlled by mixing ( and hence light regime) and nutrient availability. With ' endless summer' conditions and full mixing, there is a successional pattern of ' muted seasonality' adapted to physical instability and environmental stability.

AB  - Investigations were conducted to test the feasibility of using fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in otoliths as an index of the growth rate and condition of the Japanese anchovy, Engraulis japonicus. The differences between the left and right sides of sagittal otoliths in terms of surface area (SA), perimeter (PM), major axis length (MJ) and minor axis length (MN) were measured in juvenile anchovies shortly after metamorphosis. The absolute values of the side differences were used as the FA index for the 4 traits. Size dependence of the FA traits upon standard length (SL) was eliminated by reducing the SL range centering on the mean value. The distribution patterns of the FA traits were statistically equivalent to those of FA. The FA values for SA and PM had a significant negative correlation to the mean growth rates obtained from the otolith daily ring information. In MJ and MN, although the correlation was not significant, FA and the mean growth rate seemed to be in a negative relationship, the latter limiting the upper border of the former. FA analyses using otolith traits have been shown to have the potential to determine condition of the Japanese anchovy.

AB  - The sustainability of the avocado producing farms in the Moquegua region was determined. The population consisted of 428 producers from where a sample was taken (n=92). The Sarandon methodology was followed, which consisted of preparing indicators and sub-indicators of the economic, social and environmental dimensions appropriate to the conditions under study, to then be processed according to the sustainability formulas of each dimension. The results indicate that the social objectives (2.67) were met to a greater degree than the environmental (2.58), or the economic (1.89). In the social aspect, basic services and access to education were more sustainable, and as critical to social integration, technological knowledge and ecological awareness; in environmental terms, the presence of barriers and diversification of production stood out, the percentage of plant cover and conservation areas were critical; and economically they highlighted the diversification for sale and marketing channels, and as critical the low yields, the high incidence of diseases, high dependence on external inputs and low monthly income. Likewise, it was determined that 27% of avocado farms are sustainable (> 2) and the general sustainability index was 2.05.

AB  - The extensive applicability of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) in various fields such as environment, agriculture, medicine or biotechnology has mostly been attributed to their better physicochemical properties as compared with conventional bulk materials. However, functions and biological effects of ENPs change across different scenarios which impede the progress in their risk assessment and safety management. This review thus intends to figure out whether properties of ENPs can be indicators of their behavior through summarizing and analyzing the available literature and knowledge. The studies have indicated that size, shape, solubility, specific surface area, surface charge and surface reactivity constitute a more accurate measure of ENPs functions and toxic effects in addition to mass concentration. Effects of ENPs are also highly dependent on dose metrics, species and strains of organisms, environmental conditions, exposure mute and duration. Searching correlations between properties and functions or biological effects may serve as an effective way in understanding positive and negative impacts of ENPs. This will ensure safe design and sustainable future use of ENPs.

AB  - Productivity and the associated generation of biomass are two definitive aspects of Large Marine Ecosystems. Knowing the historic, prevailing conditions (the baseline) in terms of these two major indicators allows countries that are aiming to manage impacts and resource utilisation within the LMES to monitor them for change and to adapt their management regimes to such changes. The Agulhas and the Somali Current LMEs are western boundary currents that flow along the eastern coastline of Africa. Recent studies, supported by the Global Environment Facility and implemented by the United Nations Environment Programme, have assisted the countries within and bordering these LMEs to capture such baseline date and to develop a transboundary monitoring and associated management response mechanisms through a Strategic Action Programme for sustainable management of the western Indian Ocean Large Marine Ecosystems. This paper highlights some of the findings from the transboundary baseline assessment and discusses how these findings and subsequent monitoring of changes can be used to support adaptive management decisions by the countries.

AB  - Remotely sensed vegetation measurements for the last 30 years combined with other climate data sets such as rainfall and sea surface temperatures have come to play an important role in the study of the ecology of arthropod-borne diseases. We show that epidemics and epizootics of previously unpredictable Rift Valley fever (RVF) are directly influenced by large-scale flooding associated with the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This flooding affects the ecology of disease transmitting arthropod vectors through vegetation development and other bioclimatic factors. This information is now utilized to monitor, model, and map areas of potential RVF outbreaks and is used as an early warning system for risk reduction of outbreaks to human and animal health, trade, and associated economic impacts. The continuation of such satellite measurements is critical to anticipating, preventing, and managing disease epidemics and epizootics and other climate-related disasters.

AB  - Regime shifts are substantial, long-lasting reorganizations of complex systems, such as ecosystems. Large ecosystem changes such as eutrophication, shifts among vegetation types, degradation of coral reefs and regional climate change often come as surprises because we lack leading indicators for regime shifts. Increases in variability of ecosystems have been suggested to foreshadow ecological regime shifts. However, it may be difficult to discern variability due to impending regime shift from that of exogenous drivers that affect the ecosystem. We addressed this problem using a model of lake eutrophication. Lakes are subject to fluctuations in recycling associated with regime shifts, as well as fluctuating nutrient inputs. Despite the complications of noisy inputs, increasing variability of lake-water phosphorus was discernible prior to the shift to eutrophic conditions. Simulations show that rising standard deviation (SD) could signal impending shifts about a decade in advance. The rising SD was detected by studying variability around predictions of a simple time-series model, and did not depend on detailed knowledge of the actual ecosystem dynamics.

AB  - Plants respond to adverse conditions by activating defense mechanisms that alter metabolism and impact agricultural crop yield. Organic mulching of Camellia oleifera leads to increased oil yield compared to control. In this study, multi-platform untargeted metabolomics and qRT-PCR were used to measure the effects of organic mulching on seed kernel metabolism. Metabolomics analysis revealed that tyrosine, tryptophan, and several fla-vonoids and polyphenol metabolites were significantly lower in the mulched treatment compared to the control, indicating lower stress levels with mulching. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that EAR, SAD, and CoHCD were up regulated by mulching, while CT, FAD7, FAD8, CoATS1, SQS, SQE, FATB, and beta-AS were down-regulated. Correlation network analysis was used to integrate data from this multi-omics investigation to analyze the relationships between differentially expressed genes, metabolites, and fruit and soil indicators concerning mulch treatment of C. oleifera.

AB  - Analyses of pollen, plant macrofossils (seeds, fruits, wood and mosses), molluscs, diatoms and vertebrate (mainly fish) remains allowed a detailed reconstruction of a middle-Holocene alluvial forest and its associated hydrological conditions. The use of multiple proxies resulted in a taxonomically more detailed and environmentally more comprehensive understanding of terrestrial as well as aquatic habitats. The results demonstrate possible biases in palaeoecological reconstructions of alluvial and estuarine environments drawn from single proxies. Many locally occurring woody taxa were underrepresented or remained undetected by pollen analyses. Seeds and fruits also proved to be inadequate to detect several locally important taxa, such as Ulmus and Hedera helix. Apparently brackish conditions inferred from diatoms, pollen and other microfossils conflicted strikingly with the evidence from molluscs, fish bones and botanical macroremains which suggest a freshwater environment. Brackish sediment (and the microfossil indicators) is likely to have been deposited during spring tides or storm surges, when estuarine waters penetrated more inland than usual. Despite the reworking and deposition of estuarine and saltmarsh sediment well above the tidal node at such events, local salinity levels largely remained unaffected.

AB  - Accumulation of unfolded, misfolded and aggregated proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) causes ER stress. ER stress can result from physiological situations such as acute increases in secretory protein biosynthesis or pathological conditions that perturb ER homeostasis such as alterations in the ER redox state. Here we monitored ER redox together with transcriptional output of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) in INS-1 insulinoma cells stably expressing eroGFP (ER-redox-sensor) and mCherry protein driven by a GRP78 promoter (UPR-sensor). Live cell imaging, flow cytometry and biochemical characterization were used to examine these parameters in response to various conditions known to induce ER stress. As expected, treatment of the cells with the reducing agent dithiothreitol caused a decrease in the oxidation state of the ER accompanied by an increase in XBP-1 splicing. Unexpectedly however, other treatments including tunicamycin, thapsigargin, DL-homocysteine, elevated free fatty acids or high glucose had essentially no influence on the ER redox state, despite inducing ER stress. Comparable results were obtained with dispersed rat islet cells expressing eroGFP. Thus, unlike in yeast cells, ER stress in pancreatic beta-cells is not associated with a more reducing ER environment.

AB  - The Tabernas Desert (Spain) is an emblematic area as it constitutes, strictly speaking, the only European desert. Under the canopy of one of the dominant shrub species, Retama sphaerocarpa, there are different microhabitat conditions that encourage the growing of a dense understory of herbs (fertile islands). However, these changes may not be enough to be also reflected in the fauna. Studying ants as bioindicators, we found higher densities of individuals and species richness below the canopy than outside it. However, while the density of individuals increased from outside the canopy to the inner position under the shrubs, species richness increased from the inner to the border position under the canopy and abruptly decreased outside it. This is because the inner positions were usually monopolized by dominant ants with populous nests that feed on aphid honeydew, such as Monomorium subopacum or Tapinoma nigerrimum. Granivorous species (genus Messor) were usually found in intermediate positions under the canopy, taking advantage of the better microclimatic conditions but close to the grass for feeding. Among the most abundant species, the only one found mainly outside the influence of the retama shrubs was the thermophilic insectivorous Cataglyphis ibericus.

AB  - Seabirds (Rissa spp. and Uria spp.) and sockeye salmon (Onchorhynchus nerka) of the eastern Bering Sea share similarities in their trophic ecology. We tested the role of seabirds as indicators of food web conditions that affect sockeye salmon at sea survival by investigating co-variation between seabirds breeding on the Pribilof Islands and returns of Bristol Bay sockeyes. We examined seabird phenology (hatching dates of eggs) against sockeye returns based on the year of ocean entry. Annual seabird hatching date was inversely related to sockeye returns, with the strongest co-variation found for sockeye which entered the ocean at 2 years of age (age 2x smolts). The mechanism supporting this covariation is unknown, but both birds and salmon may be responding to changes in prey availability (a "bottom-up" effect). The co-variation between seabird hatching date and sockeye returns supports the idea that variation in seabird breeding parameters indicates food web conditions that also affect other upper trophic level predators in marine systems. Coupling seabird phenology with existing annual predictions for Bristol Bay salmon may improve forecasts and fishery management. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Registering a veterinary medicinal product (VMP) in the European Union requires assessing its potential to contaminate surface waters (SW) on a European scale. VMP are spread to land in manure or excreted during grazing and may enter SW through runoff, erosion, or leaching. Since the factors driving these processes vary largely across Europe, it is necessary to identify characteristic conditions, so-called scenarios, un(er which VMP enter SW. These scenarios may guide the parameterization of mechanistic fate models to predict environmental concentrations for environmental risk assessment. A number of such scenarios for pesticides and VMP have been developed rather pragmatically. Here, we describe how a geo-referenced European database of driving factors was used to divide the European environment into groups with similar conditions for SW contamination by VMP. Out of these groups, relevant exposure scenarios in Europe were selected by a simple scoring system. Comparing these to the existing scenarios showed that a number of situations are not well covered. The newly identified scenarios are primarily located in hilly areas of Central Europe and the Mediterranean, and in Eastern European plains with a continental climate. We recommend that they are included in the technical guidelines for higher-tier assessment of VMP.

AB  - Lipid content has been used as a measure of energetic status and condition in a number of fish and invertebrate species and can potentially be applied to hard corals. However, common methods for measuring lipid content are time consuming, technically challenging and expensive and these limitations have prohibited the application of lipid content as an impact-monitoring tool. To overcome these limitations, a rapid low-tech method for determining neutral to polar lipid ratios from hard coral tissue samples has been developed. This paper describes the development of the method together with a preliminary application of the technique carried out in a field study to determine whether the relative amounts of non-polar storage lipid to polar structural lipid may provide insight into the nutritional condition of individual coral colonies under differing environmental stresses. Variation in the lipid ratios of the hard coral Acropora nobilis, collected from the Montebello Islands off Western Australia, was correlated with local light and sediment regimes. This initial application of the method has demonstrated the viability of the technique, which subsequently has the potential to be applied in the analysis of a large number of samples as would be required in environmental monitoring.

TI  - STUDY OF THE PHYSICAL TRAITS OF CAMBISOL IN ZERO-TILLAGE SEEDING OF WINTER-WHEAT
T2  - ROSTLINNA VYROBA
LA  - Czech
AB  - Basic indicators of the physical soil conditions (porosity, bulk density, water and air characteristics)were studied on acid Cambisol, loam sandy, medium skeletal soil in the humid area of the potato growing region at the altitude of 710 m above sea level in the zero-tillage seeding of winter wheat into stubble of untreated soil after legume-grass mixture as a forecrop. Average yearly precipitation was 963 mm, gradient of slope 18-degrees, depth of topsoil 18 to 24 cm (upper and lower parts of plot). A sloping plot was chosen for the fast that as a secondary, soil erosion has been studied. Humus content in the topsoil amounted to 3.5 %, texture composition of the soil profile is presented in Tab. 1. Medium to high proportion of the skelet in the subsoil and topsoil as well, was a serious obstacle for soil cultivation through tillage.
   Winter wheat was sown on 10th to 11th October 1988 with no-tillage sowing-machine 20-SEX-BJ - 150 into the stubble, i.e. a day after forecrop harvest, the sowing rate was 220 kg per 1 ha. The control was ploughed to the depth of 22 cm on 16th October 1988; a day after this - pre-sowing soil preparation was done with peg harrows and sowing with the same sowing rate, That is why, the soil had no time for natural compaction. In both the cases, sowing was done with delay with respect to the time of cultural practices. Just this was one of intentions of the trial - to omit the time required for soil compaction of ploughed land before sowing through the sowing to untilled soil and at the same time to eliminate one of the reasons of delayed sowing in this region.
   The results of studying the physical soil traits before and after establishment of the trial am presented in Tabs II and III. The soil after harvested forecrop, to which sowing was performed without tillage, was in bad physical conditions (Tab. II): O(r) in the topsoil 1-58 - 1.61 g per cm3, in the subsoil this being 1.67 g per cm3. A low porosity in topsoil and subsoil, as well, and a low air capacity indicate the compacted soil (Vachal et al., 1983).
   After finishing the trial, physical parameters of soil in zero-tillage were not worsened (Tab. III), but contrary to this, O(r) value was reduced to 1.50 - 1.55 g per cm3 and the total porosity rose and an insignificant rise of the density of non-capillary pores P(N) was observed. Total physical soil conditions was not worsened, however, this indicated the trend of improvement.
   The soil before sowing exceedingly loosened (Tab. II) in the control tilled variant with the values of porosity 58.20 - 57.50 % of volume, O(r) 0.98 - 1.10 g per cm3. This resulted in delayed germination and emergence rate of winter wheat in comparison with no-tillage variant and in marked frost-lifting of caryopses to thc soil surface in the period before spring. The ploughed land is susceptible to soil compaction, as uncompelled as secondary, technogeneous. This is confirmed by the data given in Tab. III, it is evident from them that physical conditions of tilled land was close to the variant with zero-tillage seeding after the harvest. It can be said that no-tillage seeding alone into stubble of untreated soil under the given soil and climatic conditions did not worsened its physical state, contrary to this, there is an indication of adverse tendency, though these short-term results cannot be over-estimated. Very significant is how will look like the physical state of thc soil after a forecrop.

AB  - Ecohydrological sensitivity, defined as the response intensity of streamflow to per unit vegetation change is an integrated indicator for assessing hydrological sensitivity to vegetation change. Understanding ecohydrological sensitivity and its influencing factors is crucial for managing water supply, reducing water-related hazards and ensuring aquatic functions by vegetation management. Yet, there is still a systematic assessment on ecohydrological sensitivity and associated driving factors especially at a seasonal scale lacking. In this study, 14 large watersheds across various environmental gradients in China were selected to quantify their ecohydrological sensitivities at a seasonal scale and to examine the role of associated influencing factors such as climate, vegetation, topography, soil and landscape. Based on the variables identified by correlation analysis and factor analysis, prediction models of seasonal ecohydrological sensitivity were constructed to test their utilities for the design of watershed management and protection strategies. Our key findings were the following: (1) ecohydrological sensi- tivities were more sensitive under dry conditions than wet conditions - for example, 1 % LAI (leaf area index) change, on average, induced 5.05 % and 1.96 % change in the dry and wet season streamflow, respectively; (2) seasonal ecohydrological sensitivities were highly variable across the study watersheds with different climate conditions, dominant soil types and hydrological regimes; and (3) the dry season ecohydrological sensitivity was mostly determined by topography (slope, slope length, valley depth and downslope distance gradient), soil (topsoil organic carbon and topsoil bulk density) and vegetation (LAI), while the wet season ecohydrological sensitivity was mainly controlled by soil (topsoilavailable water-holding capacity), landscape (edge density) and vegetation (leaf area index). Our study provided a useful and practical framework to assess and predict ecohydrological sensitivities at the seasonal scale. The established ecohydrological sensitivity prediction models can be applied to ungauged watersheds or watersheds with limited hydrological data to help decision makers and watershed managers effectively manage hydrological impacts through vegetation restoration programs. We conclude that ecohydrological sensitivities at the seasonal scale are varied by climate, vegetation and watershed property, and their understanding can greatly support the management of hydrological risks and protection of aquatic functions.

AB  - An extensive survey of groundwater quality was performed at the regional scale in peri-urban and industrial contexts of the Walloon Region (Belgium). To this end, 243 sampling locations from 8 areas located in different geological contexts and different peri-urban areas of the region were sampled outside pollution hotspots related to contaminated sites. Each groundwater sample was analyzed for 19 inorganic trace elements, 59 organic micropollutants and 8 major and minor elements. Five physico-chemical parameters were measured in the field, at the time of sampling to determine the environmental conditions prevailing in groundwater. Existing groundwater chemical data available outside such peri-urban and industrial areas were also compiled from existing groundwater quality databases for comparison. Most of the organic and inorganic pollutants are detected and their levels of occurrence are described statistically. Cumulative distribution function plots allow comparing the distributions of inorganic trace elements in and outside the urbanized and industrialized areas and among the different prevailing geological contexts. Two indicators are introduced, one quantifying the impact on inorganic trace elements of diffuse pollution in urban and industrial areas, the other reflecting the influence of lithology on concentrations in groundwater. Results show that the composition of groundwater is altered in peri-urban and industrial areas with increased concentrations for several organic pollutants and for most inorganic trace elements. However, the results clearly indicate that for the inorganic trace elements, anthropogenic influence is not limited to increased discharge of pollutants in the urban and industrial areas but also to significant changes in environmental conditions, with more reducing and acidic conditions observed in groundwater. The influence of lithology is also marked in the data set. From a more pragmatic point of view, the data set has been also used to derive upper limits of pollutant background concentrations to be used in decision-making related to the management of contaminated groundwater in urban and industrial environments in the Walloon Region.

KW  - student self-government
AB  - Introduction. Nowadays, student self-government is one of the effective forms of student self-organization; it appears to be the mechanism of representing and protecting students' rights. It is the factor of self-realization and development of social activity in conditions of higher education institution.
   Problem Statement. The formation of student social activity is a problem of modern pedagogy, since it requires the development of technologies for participating in socially significant activities within the social environment of higher education institutions.
   Purpose. To characterize and to analyze the stages of the pedagogical experiment regarding the state of the students' proficiency in terms of social activity.
   Materials and Methods. A series of diagnostic methods has been used: overt observation, surveys (polls), testing, ranking, moderation method, method of independent expert assessments, a modified version of E. Shakirova's methodology for diagnosing student social activity, and V. Yadov's methods.
   Results. The stages of the assessment of the levels of the formation of student social activity as well as their indicators and criteria have been characterized and analyzed; the socio-pedagogical conditions for the formation of student social activity within the self-government bodies of a higher education institution have been determined: the creation of the structure and bodies of student self-government alongside with the ensuring of the representation of each student groups; the organization of student self-government activities in various fields (organizational, public, research-oriented, physical culture and health-targeted, artistic, creative, educational, informational, and volunteering); the self-organization of students' life and their involvement into various forms of work performed by self-government bodies; the involvement of teachers into the work of student self-government and promotion of step-by-step formation of student social activity.
   Conclusions. Currently, students are considered to be not only an intellectual and demographic, but also a spiritual resource of our country. Therefore, social and pedagogical support for the formation and development of indicators of student social activity is a priority task of social and educational work of higher education institutions.

AB  - Upper Cretaceous marine mudstones are widely known as the most important source rocks in the Western African rift basins. However, geochemical studies on their occurrence and formation mechanism are scarce. In this study, a detailed geochemical investigation within a sequence stratigraphic framework was carried out to reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental conditions and to establish models on the depositional history of Upper Cretaceous marine mudstones in the Termit Basin (Niger), western African. A total of six third-order sequences (DSQ1, DSQ2, YSQ1, YSQ2, YSQ3 and MSQ1, from bottom to top) were identified in the Upper Cretaceous. The distribution of biomarkers from 33 mudstone samples in different sequences indicate that mudstones from YSQ3 were mainly deposited in a suboxic to oxic environment, with significant contributions from mixed terrigenous higher plants and lower aquatic organisms in fresh-brackish water column. In contrast, the other sequences (YSQ2, YSQ1, DSQ2 and DSQ1) mainly represent a suboxic to anoxic marine environment with a stratified water column (0.59 < pristane/phytane < 1.71, 20.78% < gammacerane/C-30 hopane < 52.23%), dominated by marine aquatic organisms such as algae and bacteria. Accumulation models of organic matter (OM) for different sequences were established to delineate the combined effects of a variety of geological and environmental controlling factors, such as global sea-level fluctuations, seawater circulation patterns, palaeoclimatic conditions, input of terrigenous OM and inherited rift palaeotopography. Most notably, the relative changes of global sea level and the patterns of seawater circulation were the critical factors controlling the sources, depositional conditions and preservation of organic matter in the Termit Basin. Organic matter rich marine mudstones in Termit Basin are closely related to high supply of terrigenous OM. This study not only provides practical depositional models for marine mudstones in the Termit Basin, but also improves the general understanding of marine organic matter accumulation in a relatively restricted inland rift environment.

AB  - The Earth is currently experiencing climatic changes that will result in similar environmental conditions to those experienced during the mid-Pliocene (5.3-3.6 million years ago [Ma]), such as similar atmospheric CO2 concentrations, elevated sea surface temperature, and higher sea-levels due to polar ice melt. Studying the temporal distribution of Antarctic diatoms and silicoflagellates from this epoch provides insights into environmental conditions and sea-ice configurations during that time, and remains the only way to realistically estimate future phytoplankton community responses and Southern Ocean sea-ice extent during large-scale transient changes of similar magnitude to that anticipated by anthropogenic causes. In this study, we identified and quantified diatoms and silicoflagellates in a sediment core section obtained from the Antarctic Wilkes Land margin (IODP Expedition 318, Hole U1361A), spanning four glacial and interglacial cycles around the Gauss/Gilbert geochron boundary (3.6 Ma) between about 3.69 and 3.56 Ma. Two major abundance peaks (around 79.66 and 76.86 mbsf; representing time intervals around 3.65 Ma and 3.58 Ma, respectively) were identified. Both peaks temporally match previously determined high productivity warm intervals (interglacials). Diatom and silicoflagellate assemblages in these two interglacial periods differed: the abundance peak in the older sediments is dominated by the pennate diatoms Fragilariopsis barronii, Rouxia naviculoides and Rouxia antarctica; indicative of seasonal, meltwater associated stratification. The abundance peak in the younger sediments is composed principally of Chaetoceros resting spores, suggesting higher productivity, strong stratification and prolonged ice-free, open water conditions. Analysing highly abundant diatoms and environmental indicator species from this IODP Site in relation to the previously determined palaeo-productivity proxy Ba/Al allowed us to refine the age model. Our study provides orbital-scale insights into the variability of Antarctic diatom and silicoflagellate assemblages during the mid-Pliocene, thereby offering a reference for future predictions of extant diatom responses to ongoing climate change.

AB  - Seabirds are often studied at individual colonies, but the confounding effects of emigration and mortality processes in open populations may lead to inappropriate conclusions on the mechanisms underlying population changes. Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus) colonies of variable population sizes are distributed along the Argentine coastline. In recent decades, several population and distributional changes have occurred, with some colonies declining and others newly established or increasing. We integrated data of eight colonies scattered along similar to 600 km in Northern Patagonia (from 41 degrees 26'S, 65 degrees 01'W to 45 degrees 11 'S, 66 degrees 30'W, Rio Negro and Chubut provinces) and conducted analysis in terms of their growth rates, production of young and of the dependence of those vital rates on colony age, size, and location. We contrasted population trends estimated from abundance data with those derived from population modeling to understand if observed growth rates were attainable under closed population scenarios. Population trends were inversely related to colony size, suggesting a density dependent growth pattern. All colonies located in the north-which were established during the last decades-increased at high rates, with the smallest, recently established colonies growing at the fastest rate. In central-southern Chubut, where colonies are the oldest, the largest breeding aggregations declined, but smaller colonies remained relatively stable. Results provided strong evidence that dispersal played a major role in driving local trends. Breeding success was higher in northern colonies, likely mediated by favorable oceanographic conditions. However, mean foraging distance and body condition of chicks at fledging were influenced by colony size. Recruitment of penguins in the northern area may have been triggered by a combination of density dependence, likely exacerbated by less favorable oceanographic conditions in the southern sector. Our results reaffirm the idea that individual colony trends do not provide confident indicators of population health, highlighting the need to redefine the scale for the study of population changes.

AB  - Reproduction of the pale sea urchin Strongylocentrotus pallidus was studied off the Primor'e coast (the northwestern part of the Japan Sea) at sea depths from 30 to 550 in. The area studied is conventionally divided into three parts with different environmental conditions. The southern part was surveyed in late May and the central and northern parts were studied early in June and in the middle June, respectively. Using the condition of the gonads of sea urchins as an indicator, it was found that, in the southern subarea, the mass spawning proceeded at the end of May-June; in the central part it occurred in June, and in the northern part it lasted from the middle of May to the middle June. It should be noted that, in the south, the spawning was more extended in time, whereas, in the north, the duration of the spawning was the shortest. Sea urchins with gonads at the stages of growing and maturing were hauled from the places with an excess of silicate within the near-bottom layer of the sea due to the mineralization of detritus, namely, diatoms, whereas the urchins with post-spawned gonads were sampled from the places with a deficit of silicates. From this it follows that the rate of maturing and the time of spawning of the sea urchins Strongylocentrotus pallidus depend on the detritus sedimentation on the sea bottom in the course of the spring bloom. In particular, the early spawning in the northern area was related to the early bloom caused by the saline stratification of the northern waters of the Japan Sea. The time of the mass spawning of the pale sea urchins off the Primor'e coast is primarily determined by the physiological response of adult individuals to the seasonal changes in their own forage base rather than by evolutionary adaptation of the population to the seasonal changes in the forage base of their larvae.

AB  - Changes in diatom assemblages in a sediment core taken from a tundra lake near the Lena River Delta, northeastern Siberia, reflect climatic and environmental changes throughout the Holocene. Significant limnological changes occurred at the same time as trees advanced into the region c. 9100 cal. yr BP (8500 radiocarbon yr BP) and subsequently retreated c. 3800 cal. yr BP (3500 radiocarbon yr BP). Prior to this treeline shift, diatom assemblages were dominated by small benthic Fragilaria species, and diatom-inferred alkalinity values were high, suggesting that climatic conditions were cool and relatively dry, and that lake productivity was probably low. Coincident with tree-line advance into the region c. 9100 cal. yr BP, inferred alkalinity decreased and remained low throughout the forested period, reflecting soil development and increased organic runoff associated with the shift in catchment vegetation. The establishment of a larch forest in the catchment corresponded with an initial period of limnological change between 9100 and 7700 cal. yr BP, suggesting that soil and forest development rook place over approximately 1400 years. Between c. 7700 cal. yr BP (c. 7000 radiocarbon yr BP) and 3800 cal. yr BP, a stable diatom assemblage dominated by Achnanthes species and low diatom-inferred alkalinity indicate the influence of organic runoff associated with a fully developed forest. A return to cooler conditions and reversion to shrub tundra c. 3800 cal. yr BP coincided with a shift back to a Fragilaria-dominated diatom assemblage and an increase in diatom-inferred alkalinity. Recent conditions have been marked by declining alkalinity estimates and a minor change in diatom assemblages, most likely reflecting an influx of humic substances from catchment pears. The close correlation between trends in reconstructed alkalinity and catchment vegetation suggests that diatom-inferred alkalinity may provide a sensitive record of soil and forest development, in unpolluted circumneutral or alkaline tree-line lakes.

AB  - Using high-yielding cultivars is an important measure to maintain grain production, especially in dryland environments. A field study in the 2016/17 and 2017/18 seasons was conducted at Luancheng station in the North China Plain (NCP) to investigate winter wheat cultivars with high-yielding characteristics under water deficit conditions. The experiment contained two parts, with part one involving 10 cultivars of winter wheat grown under I0 (rainfed), I1 (one irrigation) and I2 (two irrigations) treatments and part two involving 32 cultivars grown under I1 treatment. The three irrigation regimes I0, I1, and I2 provided approximately 60 %, 70 % and 80 % of the seasonal potential evapotranspiration, respectively. Yield variations were up to 47 % among the 10 cultivars in the two seasons, and several cultivars could produce continuously higher yields than those of other cultivars under the different treatments. High-yielding cultivars produced higher water productivity than that of other cultivars. No single agronomic or physiological characteristics, except for biomass, could explain the yield differences among cultivars. However, canopy temperature (CT) during the grain filling stage had a continuous negative linear correlation with grain yield under limited water supply conditions in a high-yielding environment. The results indicated that the genetic variation in grain yield might be attributed to the ability to withdraw soil water, especially the deeper soil water, during the grain filling stage, which would result in a cooler canopy. CT as an indicator of high-yielding cultivars was further confirmed among the 32 cultivars under I1 treatment in the 2016/17. A relative adequate water supply during the grain filling stage also prolonged leaf greenness which was beneficial to dry matter production and grain yield. Therefore, the ability to efficiently utilize soil water and maintain dry matter production during the grain filling stage are two important characteristics for maintaining the high yield of winter wheat under water deficit conditions in the NCP.

AB  - Riparian forests have cool and humid microclimates, and one aim of leaving forested buffer strips between clear-cut areas and streams is to conserve these microclimatic conditions. We used an experimental study set up of 35 streamside sites to study the impacts of buffer strip width (15 or 30 m) and selective logging within the buffer strips on summer-time air temperature, relative air humidity and canopy openness 12 years after logging. The buffer strip treatments were compared to unlogged control sites. We found that 15-meter buffer strips with or without selective logging and 30-meter buffer strips with selective logging were insufficient in maintaining temperature, relative humidity and canopy openness at similar levels than they were in control sites. In contrast, 30-meter buffer strips differed only little from control sites, although they did have significantly lower mean air humidity. Microclimatic changes were increased by southern or southwestern aspect of the clear-cut, and by logging on the opposite side of the stream. We also tested how the cover of three indicator mosses (Hylocomium splendens, Pseudobqum cinclidioides and Polytrichum commune) had changed (from pre-logging to 12 years post-logging) in relation to post-logging air temperature, relative air humidity and canopy openness. We found that each of the species responded to at least one of these physical conditions. Air humidity was the most significant variable for explaining changes in the cover of the indicator moss species, suggesting that the changes in this microclimatic component has biological impacts. We conclude that to preserve riparian microclimatic conditions and species dependent on those, buffer strips should exceed 30 m in width, and not be selectively logged. Wider buffer strips are required if the clear-cut is towards south or southwest, or if the two sides of the stream are logged at the same time or during subsequent years.

AB  - The waste management industry is an important employer, and exposure of waste-handling workers to microorganisms is considered an occupational health problem. Besides fungal contamination, it is important to consider the co-occurrence of mycotoxins in this setting. Forklifts with closed cabinet and air conditioner are commonly used in waste industry to transport waste and other products within the facilities, possibly increasing the risk of exposure under certain conditions. The aim of this study was to assess the fungal contamination and mycotoxin levels in filters from the air conditioning system of forklift cabinets, as an indicator to assess occupational exposure of the drivers working in a waste sorting facility. Cytotoxicity was also assessed to understand and characterize the toxicity of the complex mixtures as present in the forklift filters. Aqueous extracts of filters from 11 vehicles were streaked onto 2% malt extract agar (MEA) with chloramphenicol (0.05 g/L) media, and in dichloran glycerol (DG18) agar-based media for morphological identification of the mycobiota. Real-time quantitative PCR amplification of genes from Aspergillus sections Fumigati, Flavi, Circumdati, and Versicolores was also performed. Mycotoxins were analyzed using LC-MS/MS system. Cytotoxicity of filter extracts was analyzed by using a MTT cell culture test. Aspergillus species were found most frequently, namely Aspergillus sections Circumdati (MEA 48%; DG18 41%) and Nigri (MEA 32%; DG18 17.3%). By qPCR, only Aspergillus section Fumigati species were found, but positive results were obtained for all assessed filters. No mycotoxins were detected in aqueous filter extracts, but most extracts were highly cytotoxic (n = 6) or medium cytotoxic (n = 4). Although filter service life and cytotoxicity were not clearly correlated, the results suggest that observing air conditioner filter replacement frequency may be a critical aspect to avoid worker's exposure. Further research is required to check if the environmental conditions as present in the filters could allow the production of mycotoxins and their dissemination in the cabinet during the normal use of the vehicles.

AB  - Growth during early life history plays a key role in the recruitment dynamics of marine fishes; however, the effects of environmental stressors on growth are often difficult to quantify. In this study, increment widths from sagittal otoliths were used as a proxy for daily growth in 102 young-of-the-year Winter Flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus collected over a 2-year period from three sites in Long Island, New York. We hypothesized that we would observe different growth patterns among bays due to an environmental gradient driven primarily by contaminant loadings and environmental stressors in our study sites. Hierarchical linear models were utilized to associate individual attributes (ontogeny, condition, and gene expression) to daily growth patterns during each year. As expected, daily growth generally displayed a negative relationship with age and daily average temperature, although the effect of temperature was much more variable. Out of 14 individual attributes, the settlement date, the age at capture, the condition indices Fulton's K and hepatosomatic index, and the expression of genes associated with immune response (pleurocidin), contaminant exposure (cytochrome P5401A), and glucose and glycogen metabolism (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) were observed to significantly and consistently affect growth. The results provide evidence of differential growth based on the date of settlement and condition, and the molecular indicators of stress suggest that growth is also influenced by habitat quality. There were significantly different relationships between individual attributes and growth among bays, but these did not always reflect the proposed environmental gradient. Together, the results suggest that anthropogenic stressors likely play a role in growth and recruitment processes in Long Island bays and indicate that growth is both spatially and temporally dynamic at multiple scales. Furthermore, this study highlights the utility of hierarchical linear models in analyzing complex daily growth data in juvenile fish, which may be applicable to other species.

AB  - Tidal stream turbines could have several direct impacts upon pursuit-diving seabirds foraging within tidal stream environments (mean horizontal current speeds > 2 ms(-1)), including collisions and displacement. Understanding how foraging seabirds respond to temporally variable but predictable hydrodynamic conditions immediately around devices could identify when interactions between seabirds and devices are most likely to occur; information which would quantify the magnitude of potential impacts, and also facilitate the development of suitable mitigation measures. This study uses shore-based observational surveys and Finite Volume Community Ocean Model outputs to test whether temporally predictable hydrodynamic conditions (horizontal current speeds, water elevation, turbulence) influenced the density of foraging black guillemots Cepphus grylle and European shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis in a tidal stream environment in Orkney, United Kingdom, during the breeding season. These species are particularly vulnerable to interactions with devices due to their tendency to exploit benthic and epi-benthic prey on or near the seabed. The density of both species decreased as a function of horizontal current speeds, whereas the density of black guillemots also decreased as a function of water elevation. These relationships could be linked to higher energetic costs of dives in particularly fast horizontal current speeds (> 3 ms(-1)) and deeper water. Therefore, interactions between these species and moving components seem unlikely at particularly high horizontal current speeds. Combining this information, with that on the rotation rates of moving components at lower horizontal current speeds, could be used to assess collision risk in this site during breeding seasons. It is also likely that moderating any device operation during both lowest water elevation and lowest horizontal current speeds could reduce the risk of collisions for these species in this site during this season. The approaches used in this study could have useful applications within Environmental Impact Assessments, and should be considered when assessing and mitigating negative impacts from specific devices within development sites.

AB  - Many studies of mammalian herbivores have employed remotely sensed vegetation greenness, in the form of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a proxy for forage quality. The assumption that reflected greenness represents forage quality often goes untested, and limited data exist on the relationships between remotely sensed and traditional forage nutrient indicators. We provide the first study connecting NDVI and forage nutrient indicators within a free-ranging African herbivore ecosystem. We examined the relationships between fecal nutrient levels (nitrogen and phosphorus), forage nutrient levels, body condition, and NDVI for African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in a South African savanna ecosystem over a 2-year period (2001 and 2002). We used an information-theoretic approach to rank models of fecal nitrogen (Nf) and phosphorus (Pf) as functions of geology, season, and NDVI in each year separately. For each year, the highest ranked models for Nf accounted for 61% and 65% of the observed variance, and these models included geology, season, and NDVI. The top-ranked model for Pf in 2001, although capturing 54% of the variability, did not include NDVI. In 2002, we could not identify a top ranking model for phosphorus (i.e., all models were within 2 AICc of each other). Body condition was most highly correlated (R-adj(2) = 0.75; P <= 0.001) with NDVI at a 1 month time lag and with N-f at a 3 months time lag (R-adj(2) = 0.65; P <= 0.001), but was not significantly correlated with P-f. Our findings suggest that NDVI can be used to index nitrogen content of forage and is correlated with improved body condition in African buffalo. Thus, NDVI provides a useful means to assess forage quality where crude protein is a limiting resource. We found that NDVI accounted for more than a seasonal effect, and in a system where standing biomass may be high but of low quality, understanding available nutrients is useful for management.

AB  - The Callovo-Oxfordian claystones located at 500 m depth at Bure (Meuse, France) are currently being investigated by Andra (the French National Radioactive Waste Management Agency) for testing the feasibility of long-term and deep geological nuclear waste disposal. In order to evaluate its potential as a geological barrier, it is very important to study, assess and describe its physico-chemical variability. The molecular biomarker composition of 150 samples of these claystones and their surrounding limestones carry diverse information on the sources of the sedimentary organic matter, the chemistry of the depositional environment, the preservation and diagenesis conditions. It also allows assessing the degree of lateral and vertical variability of the organic matter within these sedimentary series. The abundance of unsaturated biomarkers, the distribution of steroids and hopanoids and CPI values > 2 prove the thermal immaturity of the organic matter. The cooccurrence of plankton, bacteria and land plant biomarkers indicate that the organic matter is a mixture of marine and continental contributions. The data also reveal that the organic matter was deposited under oxic and open-sea conditions except for a brief event of photic, zone anoxia at the beginning of the Middle Callovian. In the claystones, the geosynthesis of diasterenes is favored to the detriment of the formation of steranes, especially in smectite-rich levels, and the organic matter is rapidly isolated from oxidizing then reducing conditions after the deposition due to the protective effect of clays. On the scale investigated, the claystones are characterized by a unique molecular facies and are thus homogenous from their organic content point of view. Yet, detailed investigation of specific molecular families indicates changes related to major claystone-limestone transitions. The homogeneity of these claystones can be explained by the paleogeographic position of their depositional setting and the plane and sub-horizontal paleotopography on which they were deposited. This study demonstrates the efficiency of organic geochemistry in the assessment of the variability of geological barriers. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The philosophy toward tillage throughout the last century in Hungary can be characterized as a fight against extreme climatic and economic situations. The 'Hungarian reasonable tillage' approach that was promoted by Cserhati at the end of the 1800s was aimed at reducing tillage without increasing the risk of crop failure in arable fields. Recently, new tillage trends and systems have been introduced because of the rise in energy prices and because of the need to cut production costs, conserve soil and water resources and protect the environment. In Hungarian relation, the rationalized plowing, loosening and mulching systems are counted to the new tillage solutions. There are new steps in the sowing methods too, such as seedbed preparation and plant in one pass, till and plant, mulch-till and plant and direct drilling, which are environment capable, throughout improving soil condition and avoiding the environment harms. The applicability of various soil conservation tillage methods is currently being tested in research projects and discussed in workshops throughout the country. In this paper, soil quality problems such as compaction, trends in soil tillage, and factors affecting soil quality or condition as well as improvement and maintenance are summarized. The data show that annual disking and plowing causes subsoil compaction at the depth of tillage within 3 years and that the compacted layer expanded both in surface and deeper layers after the 5th year. Soil quality deterioration by tillage-pans was improved by subsoiling and maintained by direct drilling and planting soil-loosening catch crops. Within a loam and a sandy loam soil there were close correlations between earthworm activity and soil quality. Earthworm numbers increased on undisturbed but noncompacted soils and soils that included stubble residues remaining on the surface, but did not increase on soils that were deteriorated by tillage-pans or left bare by the absence of mulch. Our goal for the new millennium, is to use only enough tillage to create and maintain harmony between soil conservation, soil quality and crop production. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The convergence of environmental pollution is one of the contemporary issues in economics. Indeed, most of the long-run climate projections and future predictions of environmental conditions are based on convergence presumption. The pioneer studies initially focused on the convergence of carbon emission per capita, yet convergence of ecological footprint per capita, accepted as a more comprehensive environmental degradation indicator than carbon emission per capita, has been begun to examine by researchers as well. The main point of this paper is to examine the stochastic and club convergence of ecological footprint among different income groups of countries from 1961 to 2016 by a panel stationarity test with smooth shifts and log-t methods. According to the empirical findings, (a) cross-section dependence exists in all income groups, (b) the findings of the panel stationarity test with smooth shifts favored divergence, (c) there are several convergent clubs among different income groups. The existence of club convergence proposes that environmental policies should consider the different convergence paths associated with club membership.

AB  - Increasing concentrations of metals in soil have posed a serious threat to the soil environment. The control and evaluation of soil metal hazards demand the establishment of soil ecological criteria, which is mainly based on the obtainment of toxicity thresholds. As the most typical representative of soil-dwelling springtails, Folsomia candida performs numerous essential ecological functions in soil and has been extensively used to investigate metal toxicity effects and thresholds. This review outlined the current state of knowledge on the metal toxicity thresholds to Folsomia candida, including (1) toxicity thresholds of soil metals for the different endpoints, (2) the influence factors of metal toxicity thresholds including the test conditions, the chemical forms of metal, the soil physicochemical properties, aging time and leaching, (3) the bioavailable fractions predicting metal toxicity thresholds, (4) the internal threshold of metals. To conclude, several recommendations for future research are given to obtain the more reliable toxicity thresholds and further supplement the toxicity data of metals to Folsomia candida.

AB  - Modern benthic foraminiferal assemblages are instrumental in providing information regarding changes in relative sea level as well as prevailing environmental conditions in marine environments. Marginal marine environments are coastal environments that are in most cases characterized by high influx of terrestrially originated nutrients. Inventorizing of modern benthic foraminiferal assemblages from such habitats can act as biotic indicators of water quality variations along with any changes in relative sea level. The present study documents the modern benthic foraminiferal assemblage from three major marginal marine habitats located along the North West coast of Bay of Bengal, in the Indian Ocean. Sediment samples for the purpose were thus collected from the Indian Sundarbans Delta, Chilika lagoon and the Gautami Godavari estuarine zone which encompasses the Kakinada bay. A total of 32 species of benthic foraminifera were documented during the study. The present observations were compared with previous reports of benthic foraminiferal diversity from these habitats and exhibited variability.

AB  - The harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation on aquatic animals, due to ozone layer reduction, have been long studied in recent years. Exposure of Rainbow Trout larvae (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to Ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) at different doses (68.75 mu w/cm(2) and 94.83 mu w/cm(2) as the minimum and maximum dose of UV-B in natural environment respectively) for 15 minutes once a day in dark condition in comparison to control group (without any solar or UV) showed a wide variety of body abnormalities and eye damages. Body curvature, yolk sac edema, fin blistering, dwarfism, eye and head abnormalities as morphological malformations were revealed during the experiment, none of the malformations were observed in control group. Histopathological changes in retina such as irregular and discontinues pigmented epithelium, necrosis of photoreceptors and degeneration of nucleus layers confirmed the destructive effects of UV-B radiation in the eyes of Rainbow Trout. Such changes in larvae can be valid as bio-indicator for pollution and UV radiation and also introduce fishes as model for toxicological studies.

AB  - The use of a biochemical multi-biomarker approach proved insufficient to obtain clear information about ecosystem health. The fish immune system is considered as an attractive non-specific marker for environmental biomonitoring which has direct implications in individual fitness and population growth. Thus, the present work proposes the use of fish immunomarkers together with more common biochemical biomarkers in sampling conditions optimized to reduce biomarker variability and increase parameter robustness. European bullheads (Cottus sp.) from 11 stations in the Artois-Picardie watershed (France) were sampled. In the multiple discriminant analysis, the sites were highly correlated with apoptosis, respiratory burst, GST and EROD activities. Moreover, the use together of biochemical and immune markers increased the percentage of fish correctly classed at each site and enhanced site separation. This study argues in favor of the utilization of apoptosis, necrosis and respiratory burst for the determination of environmental risk assessment in addition to the set of biochemical biomarkers commonly used in fish.

AB  - We evaluate the reliability of communities of bacteria and ciliated protozoa as indicators of freshwater ecological health. Samples of epilithic biofilm were taken from 18 freshwater streams, impacted by varying types and degrees of catchment modification. Communities of bacteria and ciliates were characterised using DNA fingerprinting techniques (automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, respectively) and macroinvertebrate data also obtained, for comparison. Similar to the macroinvertebrates, the taxa richness of ciliate communities was reduced in more developed stream catchments; significant differences in the evenness of ciliate communities were also detected. We could identify no significant relationship between the richness of bacterial taxa and the percentage catchment development. However, a significant trend was detected between bacterial community structure and the predominant catchment land use (rural vs. urban) using a Bray-Curtis measure of similarity, a relationship not detected for the ciliate and macroinvertebrate communities. These findings indicate that stream bacterial, ciliate and macroinvertebrate communities each respond differently to various catchment conditions and highlight the potential of microbial communities to provide novel, alternative indicators of stream ecosystem health.

AB  - To develop mathematical models for mycelium growth and ergosterol formation in conditions of periodic stationary culture; to verify possibilities of applying a model describing the relationship between ergosterol content and mycelium quantity.
   The mould growth and ergosterol formation models covering all phases of mould growth are described using a modified logistic equation with the addition of an exponential function. The correlation between ergosterol and mycelium biomass depended on the growth phase of mould. Meaningful relation was obtained for initial two phases, when both parameters were growing equally. The quadratic function for estimation of the biomass based on ergosterol content was formulated. The error resulting from the application of this function in initial phases of moulds growth was small at 5-7%, in the following phases it was at 11-31%.
   Mycelium biomass can be precisely determined basing on the ergosterol content, when we know the moulds growth phase. In natural environments, without the information about growth phases, it will be possible, but with the higher error.
   Presented model based on the ergosterol content making possible to estimate the quantity of mycelium in moulds cultures and natural environments.

AB  - Traditional microbiological methods of cultivation recover less than 1% of the total bacterial species, and the culturable portion of bacteria is not representative of the total phylogenetic diversity. Classical cultivation strategies are now known to supply excessive nutrients to a system and therefore select for fast-growing bacteria that are capable of colony or biofilm formation. New approaches to the cultivation of bacteria which rely on growth in dilute nutrient media or simulated environments are beginning to address this problem of selection. Here we describe a novel microcultivation method for soil bacteria that mimics natural conditions. Our soil slurry membrane system combines a polycarbonate membrane as a growth support and soil extract as the substrate. The result is abundant growth of uncharacterized bacteria as microcolonies. By combining microcultivation with fluorescent in situ hybridization, previously "unculturable" organisms belonging to cultivated and noncultivated divisions, including candidate division TM7, can be identified by fluorescence microscopy. Successful growth of soil bacteria as microcolonies confirmed that the missing culturable majority may have a growth strategy that is not observed when traditional cultivation indicators are used.

AB  - The bacteriocin BacR1 was purified from culture supernatant of Staphylococcus aureus UT0007 by sequential ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography, and C-4 reverse-phase chromatography steps, Mass spectrographic analysis indicated that the purified peptide has a molecular mass of 3,338 Da, It is resistant to environmental conditions, retaining full biological activity after exposure to pH extremes (pHs 3 to 11), heating at 95 degrees C for 15 min, and exposure to strong chaotropic agents. BacR1 was destroyed with a complete loss of biological activity after digestion with trypsin and proteinase K, Amino acid sequence analysis revealed a high concentration of Asx, Gly, and Pro residues and a high proportion of hydrophobic amino acids, The peptide is bactericidal and kills in a dose-dependent manner, but it does not lyse log-phase cells of Corynebacterium renale, the routine indicator organism for bacteriocin assay, A specific receptor for binding was detected on sensitive cells but not on insensitive cells, Competition assays showed that UV-inactivated cells could protect susceptible cells from antibacterial action, A partial inhibitory spectrum revealed that organisms from the following genera are susceptible: Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Corynebacterium, Haemophilus, Bordetella, Moraxella, Pasteurella, Neisseria, and Bacillus.

AB  - This study examined the benthic macroinvertebrate communities of 20 springs in southeastern Ontario in relation to major water chemical variables and temperature. Significant differences were evident among the spring communities, and a TWINSPAN classification showed three major groups, which were associated with different levels of urbanization and water chemical conditions. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) ordinations indicated that the major environmental gradient was related to temperature and NH4 and to two springs adjacent to a landfill site. CCA ordination of a sub-data set excluding these latter two sites together with 3 closely related variables better illustrated the response of spring communities to different levels of urbanization. The strongest relationship to emerge was that between taxon occurrences and chloride, a major contaminant in groundwater in the study area and believed to be derived from road salt. Several taxa were closely associated with high chloride levels (e.g., Tipulidae and Ceratopogonidae), whereas others occurred only in springs with low chloride levels (e.g., Gammarus pseudolimnaeus and Turbellaria). The possibility of using spring macroinvertebrates as biological indicators of chloride contamination of groundwater is discussed.

AB  - Constrasting views are held about the possibility of developing ecologically sustainable forestry in northern boreal forests, the taiga. Foresters tend to be optimistic, but they evaluate 'sustainability' on the sole basis of timber production, whereas some environmentalists express very pessimistic views. The conflict can be resolved on substantial arguments, backed by ecological data. I review ecological characteristics of the taiga and the consequences of modem forest management for the forest fauna, particularly in northwestern Europe. Uniform 'monoculture' would be disastrous for a majority of forest species, but it is, fortunately, impossible to attain: heterogeneity in forest vegetation and stand structure remains. This improves prospects of maintaining a diverse fauna in appropriately managed forests. Systematic surveys to detect patterns in abundance variation, and assessments of ecological conditions for population viability ('minimum requirements') of target species are urgent research priorities. The taiga seems to be a resilient ecological system, and the possibilities of modifying management practices such that they match forest dynamics seem good. I discuss recommendations drawing upon conclusions presented in other papers in this issue.

AB  - Background Migrations in temperate systems typically have two migratory phases, spring and autumn, and many migratory ungulates track the pulse of spring vegetation growth during a synchronized spring migration. In contrast, autumn migrations are generally less synchronous and the cues driving them remain understudied. Our goal was to identify the cues that migrants use in deciding when to initiate migration and how this is updated while en route. Methods We analyzed autumn migrations of Arctic barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus) as a series of persistent and directional movements and assessed the influence of a suite of environmental factors. We fitted a dynamic-parameter movement model at the individual-level and estimated annual population-level parameters for weather covariates on 389 individual-seasons across 9 years. Results Our results revealed strong, consistent effects of decreasing temperature and increasing snow depth on migratory movements, indicating that caribou continuously update their migratory decision based on dynamic environmental conditions. This suggests that individuals pace migration along gradients of these environmental variables. Whereas temperature and snow appeared to be the most consistent cues for migration, we also found interannual variability in the effect of wind, NDVI, and barometric pressure. The dispersed distribution of individuals in autumn resulted in diverse environmental conditions experienced by individual caribou and thus pronounced variability in migratory patterns. Conclusions By analyzing autumn migration as a continuous process across the entire migration period, we found that caribou migration was largely related to temperature and snow conditions experienced throughout the journey. This mechanism of pacing autumn migration based on indicators of the approaching winter is analogous to the more widely researched mechanism of spring migration, when many migrants pace migration with a resource wave. Such a similarity in mechanisms highlights the different environmental stimuli to which migrants have adapted their movements throughout their annual cycle. These insights have implications for how long-distance migratory patterns may change as the Arctic climate continues to warm.

AB  - In the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region of Ethiopia, improved water is the main source of water for household purposes. Access to improved water closer to their homes benefits the community in many ways. It improves their health status, saves their time and energy, and improves their productivity in jobs and education they are engaged in. However, due to natural and human activities, improved water sources do not always deliver good quality of water. It can be contaminated by different pathogenic microorganisms and chemicals. The result indicated that 44.7% and 50.9% of the samples were contaminated with Escherichia coli and enterococci respectively, and from the sanitary condition survey, 57.6% of the water sources exhibited from intermediate- to very high-risk level. And the risk priority matrix identifies 95 (27.9%) samples with high risk and 54 (15.9%) of the samples with very high risk. The main risks identified at those unsafe water sources were that the drainage canals were blocked with mud, grass, leaves, and stones; animals drinking the overflow water and grazing in the proximity of water sources and feces such as cow dung were observed; inadequate protection of water sources such as absence of fences and diversion ditches; and stagnant water near the source. The study conducted in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region has clearly indicated that people may be at risk of being exposed to pathogens in half of the improved water sources when used for drinking based on the microbial indicator data or the sanitary inspection risk score. Though no correlation resulted from water quality and sanitary condition of sources, the risk priority matrix did enable prioritization of 54 very high-risk-level water sources for urgent targeted interventions from a total of 340 improved drinking water sources. From this, targeted interventions, improving water management practices, identifying and implementing effective water treatment options, providing sustainable energy sources for the supply of continuous water, and implementing climate resilience water safety planning, are recommended.

AB  - Despite the widespread use and strong promotion of the sustainable forest management approach, there are still uncertainties about the actual contribution of current forest management practices to sustainability. We studied the problem of sustainable timber production in four tropical countries (Belize, Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago). Data assessed on experimental plots covering 10 km(2) were used to compare management practices of four forest tenure types that commonly exist in the study countries: large scale concessions (LSC), private forests (PR), periodic block system forests (PBS), and community managed forests (CM). As an indicator of sustainable timber production, we calculated the recovery times expected under the initial condition of the stands and compared them with currently practiced cutting cycles. Three growth scenarios were simulated using diameter growth rates (1.6/2.7/4.5 mm year(-1)) from empirical data from studies in the region. Initial volumes were determined for all commercial trees as well as for commercial trees with a DBH-threshold >= 45 cm. Highest initial volumes were found in LSC and PBS managed forests. Lowest volumes were found in CM and PR forests. Assuming the lowest growth rate for all commercial trees, none of the stands studied reached the initial pre-harvest volumes within the currently practiced cutting cycles. Assuming the highest growth rate for all trees, LSC, PBS, and PR forests reach the initial pre-harvest volume. Looking at the subset of commercial trees with a DBH >= 45 cm, all stands will reach the initial volume within 30 years only if the highest growth rate is assumed. We show that general harvest codes do not guarantee sustainable forest management in the tropics. Local stand conditions must always be one of the guiding principles of sustainable timber utilization. Applying the rigid rules, which do not take into account the current conditions of the stands, entails long-term risk of forest degradation.

AB  - Environmental magnetism has been successfully used in the study of paleoenvironment and paleoclimate change. The red soil is widely distributing in Southern China. In this study, we conducted a systematic analysis by environmental magnetism and the color to study magnetic differences and possible causes of subtropical red soil derived from different parent rock weathering crust. Two red soil sections which respectively derived from granite and metamorphic weathering crust locate in Nanping City, Fujian Province. Two sections are about 15 kilometers far away from each other, and have the similar climatic conditions. The results show that: (1) The parent material of the Nanping North Station red soil (NPN) section is a relatively strongly magnetic granite. Due to dissolution of more coarse multi-domain (MD) magnetite to stable single domain (SSD) particles and a small amount of Pseudo-single domain (PSD) magnetite particles during pedogenesis, there is a decrease trend of magnetic susceptibility from bottom to top of the section. In contrast, the Nanfang red soil (NF) section is derived from weakly magnetic metasandstone, with the base of hematite at the transition layer and parent material layer, the magnetic enhancement in the upper part of the section is due to the formation of finer superparamagnetic (SP) magnetic particles during pedogenesis. It indicates that the different parent material is the main reason for the difference in magnetic properties of red soils in subtropical regions. (2) The climatic conditions of the two sections of NPN and NF are basically the same, and the magnetic parameters differences are more obvious than the color indexes. Because of the different parent material of profiles, the relationship between magnetic properties and climate is ambiguous. The ratio of yellowness to redness (b*/a*) is far less than the magnetic differences, suggesting that the ratio of goethite to hematite can more accurately reflect the average climatic conditions in the study area, that is, the secondary magnetic minerals are more suitable climatic indicators of red soil in the subtropical zone.

Light regimes beneath tree canopies are mainly driven by the solar angle, topography, and vegetation structure, whose three-dimensional complexity creates heterogeneous light conditions that are challenging to quantify, especially across large areas. Remotely sensed canopy structure data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) provide outstanding opportunities for advancement in this respect. We used ALS point clouds and a digital terrain model to produce hemispherical photographs from which we derived indices of nondirectional diffuse skylight and direct sunlight reaching the understory. We validated our approach by comparing the performance of these indices, as well as canopy closure (CCl) and canopy cover (CCo), for explaining the light conditions experienced by forest plant communities, as indicated by the Landolt indicator values for light (L-light) from 43 vegetation surveys along an elevational gradient. We applied variation partitioning to analyze how the independent and joint statistical effects of light, macroclimate, and soil on the spatial variation in plant species composition (i.e., turnover, Simpson dissimilarity, beta(SIM)) depend on light approximation methodology. Diffuse light explained L-light best, followed by direct light, CCl and CCo (R-2 = .31, .23, .22, and .22, respectively). The combination of diffuse and direct light improved the model performance for beta(SIM) compared with CCl and CCo (R-2 = .30, .27 and .24, respectively). The independent effect of macroclimate on beta(SIM) dropped from an R-2 of .15 to .10 when diffuse light and direct light were included. The ALS methods presented here outperform conventional approximations of below-canopy light conditions, which can now efficiently be quantified along entire horizontal and vertical forest gradients, even in topographically complex environments such as mountains. The effect of macroclimate on forest plant communities is prone to be overestimated if local light regimes and associated microclimates are not accurately accounted for.

AB  - Two marine palynomorph assemblages recovered from two glacio-eustatic sedimentary cycles from the Cape Roberts Project (CRP), which recovered over 1500 m of Oligocene and Miocene strata from the western margin of the Victoria Land Basin, are investigated. We present results from one cycle dated as early Oligocene and the other dated as late Oligocene. Modest numbers of marine palynomorphs were recovered, with an average abundance of 56 specimens per gram. The assemblages recovered from both cycles are broadly similar, and dominated by acritarchs and the phycoma of prasinophyte algae. These include Leiosphaeridia sp. 2, Leiosphaeridia sp. 3, and the prasinophyte alga, Cymatiosphaera sp. 2. In detail, however, the lower Oligocene assemblage is different from that of the upper Oligocene. The lower Oligocene cycle includes Impagidinium cf. dispertium and Impagidinium cf elegans. Cymatiosphaera sp. 6 and Pyxidinopsis sp. are abundant. The upper Oligocene cycle is characterized by an absence of Cymatiosphaera (?) invaganata, Cymatiosphaera sp. 8, and Pterospemella sp. A. It has very low numbers of Acritarch sp. b, Impagidinium and Pyxidinopsis. It contains Tasmanites sp. and Brigantedinium pynei, and it has higher abundances of Lejeunecysta sp. 1 and Sigmopollis than the lower Oligocene cycle. The environmental interpretations of the CRP core from other workers using sedimentological and paleontological indicators are used to infer environmental conditions that are likely to have influenced the marine palynomorph assemblages. Paleontological and sedimentological analysis suggests that both cycles were deposited in cold conditions, with sea ice and melt water influence, although the upper Oligocene assemblage is inferred to have existed in colder marine conditions, with more prolonged sea ice cover and less associated fresh water input than the assemblage of early Oligocene times. The application of modem analogues for some of the marine palynomorph taxa identified suggest the presence of sea ice, and occasionally lowered salinity in both cycles. This is broadly consistent with the findings of the other paleoenvironmental studies on the CRP cores. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The maximum concentration of a regulated substance that is allowed in a wastewater effluent usually is determined from the amount of dilution provided by the receiving water. Dilution flow is estimated from historical data by application of statistical criteria that define low flow conditions for regulatory purposes. Such use of historical data implies that the past is a good indicator of future conditions, at least for the duration of a discharge permit. Short records, however, introduce great uncertainty in the estimation of low flows because they are unlikely to capture events with recurrence frequencies of multiple years (e.g., ENSO events or droughts). We conducted an analysis of daily flows at several gages with long records in the South Platte River basin of Colorado. Low flows were calculated for successive time blocks of data (3-, 5-, 10-, and 20-years), and these were compared with low flows calculated for the entire period of record (> 70 years). In unregulated streams, time blocks of three or five years produce estimates of low flows that are highly variable and consistently greater than estimates derived from a longer period of record. Estimates of low flow from 10-year blocks, although more stable, differ from the long term estimates by as much as a factor of two because of climate variation. In addition, the hydrographs of most streams in Colorado have been influenced by dams, diversions, or water transfers. These alterations to the natural flow regime shorten the record that is useful for analysis, but also tend to increase the calculated low flows. The presence of an upward trend in low flows caused by water use represents an unanticipated risk because it fails to incorporate societal response to severe drought conditions. Thus, climate variability poses a significant risk for water quality both directly, because it may not be represented adequately in the short periods of the hydrologic record that are typically used in permits, and indirectly, through its potential to cause altered use of water during time of scarcity.

AB  - Reidite, the high-pressure zircon (ZrSiO4) polymorph, is a diagnostic indicator of impact events. Natural records of reidite are, however, scarce, occurring mainly as micrometer-sized lamellae, granules, and dendrites. Here, we present a unique sequence of shocked zircon grains found within a clast from the Chassenon suevitic breccia (shock stage III) from the similar to 200 Ma, 20-50 km wide Rochechouart impact structure in France. Our study comprises detailed characterization with scanning electron microscopy coupled with electron backscatter diffraction with the goal of investigating the stability and response of ZrSiO4 under extreme P-T conditions. The shocked zircon grains have preserved various amounts of reidite ranging from 4% up to complete conversion. The grains contain various variants of reidite, including the common habits: lamellae and granular reidite. In addition, three novel variants have been identified: blade, wedge, and massive domains. Several of these crosscut and offset each other, revealing that reidite can form at multiple stages during an impact event. Our data provide evidence that reidite can be preserved in impactites to a much greater extent than previously documented. We have further characterized reversion products of reidite in the form of fully recrystallized granular zircon grains and minute domains of granular zircon in reidite-bearing grains that occur in close relationship to reidite. Neoblasts in these grains have a distinct crystallography that is the result of systematic inheritance of reidite. We interpret that the fully granular grains have formed from prolonged exposure of temperatures in excess of 1200 degrees C. Reidite-bearing grains with granular domains might signify swift quenching from temperatures close to 1200 degrees C. Grains subjected to these specific conditions therefore underwent partial zircon-to-reidite reversion, instead of full grain recrystallization. Based on our ZrSiO4 microstructural constraints, we decipher the grains evolution at specific P-T conditions related to different impact stages, offering further understanding of the behavior of ZrSiO4 during shock.

AB  - For many fish species, environmental colour may act either as a source of stress or as a stress-buffer, alleviating behavioural and physiological responses after a stressful situation. While much is known on the effects of environmental colour on fish stress parameters, knowledge on the effects of stress on fish colour preferences is still lacking. In order to test the effects of stress on colour preference in fish, in this work, we exposed rainbow trout embryos (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to stressful conditions (air exposure, pheromone alarm cue or control, with minimal stress) from 19 to 44 days post fertilization (dpf). They were then raised up to 56 dpf in bright, dark, green or blue environments. After that, fry were individually tested for colour preference in a three-chambered arena where they could choose between green and blue areas. The time spent in the blue and in the green chamber was compared between experimental groups. Rainbow trout fry exposed to minimal stress (control) or to biotic stress (pheromone alarm) showed increased time in the blue environment, with little effect of ambient colour where they were raised. However, fish that experienced air exposure stress showed a lack of colour preference irrespective of the colour they were raised in afterwards. These results imply that early life stress affects colour preference in rainbow trout, suggesting that abiotic stressors, such as air exposure, may affect colour perception or behavioural plasticity in young fish. If the results presented herein are corroborated by future studies in fish at different life stages, beyond the embryonic phase, colour preference tests may be used as an additional and potential welfare indicator to estimate, in a retrospective manner, which stressors were faced by the individuals during early stages. By knowing whether or not their fish were exposed to certain stressful conditions may allow farmers to better adapt fish rearing conditions and to implement strategies that alleviate any long-term impacts that may exist, and, therefore, improve fish welfare.

AB  - The size-specific nutritional conditions of larval sardines, Sardinops melanostictus, from the main Kuroshio Current and its offshore waters off eastern Japan were assessed by lipid analysis. A rapid lipid analysis technique (diagnostic kits for human serum lipids) was used to measure the different lipid components of individual sardine larvae as indicators of their nutritional condition. Size-specific growth trajectories of individual larvae were estimated by the biological intercept method, and the recent daily growth rate of standard length (SL) was calculated from the 3 d outer increment width on the otolith. Relationships between the amount of larval phospholipid (PL; tissue weight indicator) and SL, and the recent daily growth rate of larva (Gr) and SL, could be expressed by the equations PL = 0.459 SL1.77 and Gr = 0.0809 SL - 0.341, respectively. There was no notable difference in these values between the two survey areas. The relationship between the amount of triglyceride (TG) and SL could be expressed allometrically (TG = 0.013 SL2.63). Th, relationship between the index of starvation tolerance (TG/PL) and SL could be expressed by the allometric equation TG/PL = 0.0288 SL0.865, suggesting that larger sardine have a higher starvation tolerance than smaller sardine. The TG of the 8 to 9 mm SL size-class larvae in the offshore area was higher than in the main Kuroshio Current. To test whether the TG for each larval sardine in the 8 to 9 mm SL size-class could be correlated with variables (temperature, chlorophyll a and distribution density of the sardine larvae) measured at the sampling stations, correlation analyses were performed. A highly significant negative correlation between TG and distribution density of the sardine larvae was found. A density-dependence effect seemed to influence the fluctuation of the larval storage energy component for short-term needs.

TI  - Preparedness of enterprises to enter the European Union and their expectations
T2  - EKONOMICKY CASOPIS
LA  - Slovak
AB  - Successful adaptation of the enterprising sphere to market conditions, its preparedness and ability to face competition pressures in case of the entry into the joint market is one of the basic conditions of the Slovak integration into the EU.
   Analyses aimed at this problem as well as empirical research accomplished to find out the preparedness: of enterprises for this changeover follows that Slovak enterprises similarly as the enterprises in other transforming countries are inadequately prepared for this step.
   Such an unsatisfactory situation has several reasons, which issue both from the inside of respective enterprises, and from the outer environment.
   One of the main internal reasons worrying the enterprising sphere is no transparency of the property relations and high rate of their uncertainty.
   In spite of the fact that most of the enterprises went over from public sector into the private one and thus property restructuring has been more or less brought to an end, instead of property stabilising one witnesses its destabilisation.
   Therefore just the consolidation of property relations, and their transparency is the first prerequisite of their efficient operation and correct exploitation.
   Further of the decisive internal factors of the successful adaptation of enterprises and indicator of their preparedness is the financial position of enterprises. Adequate capital and property equipment is an irreplaceable condition for the successful operation of an enterprise. Its level depends on the level of financial management of the enterprise, which is closely connected with the character of property relations. Good financial position belongs to the internal bases of firm's development and is one of the conditions of its quick adaptation to the conditions of the EU Single Market.
   Financial position of enterprises determines to a large extent their competitiveness. The decrease of share in the relevant market is often accompanied exactly by the deterioration of the financial situation of the enterprise. It is evident that enterprises with better financial position realise their position in foreign markets more efficiently than enterprises in bad financial situation.
   From the point of view of the financial situation of the enterprises, the access to financial resources is important. Enterprises in better financial position also have better access to financial resources. The disadvantage of the Slovak enterprises is their current preference of high concentration of their property. which creates a barrier of obtaining financial resources.
   External parameters of enterprise adaptation are not less important. Among them an important determinant is the political system ensuring political stability, which to a decisive measure determines the success of economic reforms. Political system of the Slovak Republic is assessed by analyses of the European Bank for Recovery and Development - EBRD as a system with partially limited competition of political parties and rank it closely under the line between transitive countries with the so called democracy with a free competition of political parties and countries with limited part.), competition, The course of reforms in Slovakia, however implemented., though not consistent, is thus set.
   Among external parameters of the development of enterprise sphere very important is the macro-economic policy that aims at macro-economic growth and macro-economic stability. Macro-economic policy creates start-up base for the generation of enterprising environment. Macro-economic environment creates institutional framework. through which positive or negative motivation of the enterprising sector arises. Macro-economic policy in interaction with the political system and the legislation order is able to ensure safety and transparency of property rights and also their exercise, which leads enterprises towards performance and competitiveness.
   Indispensable condition for the balanced state of the enterprising sphere is also the improvement to finance enterprises externally. The banks play indispensable role here. Banking sector is one of the main sources of financing enterprises. To fulfil this task appropriately it is necessary to conclude bank restructuring and to improve the efficiency of their activities.
   The improvement of the situation in the enterprising sphere, and the increased level of its preparedness to enter single market should be the synergic effect of all these factors, external and internal. Since not all assumptions are sufficiently fulfilled, the degree of enterprise preparedness is inadequate either. These conclusions are acknowledged also by empiric researches made by the experts of Eurochambers in ten candidate countries and also by the surveys implemented by the Institute of the Slovak and World Economic of the Slovak Academy of Sciences at the selected sample of the Slovak firms, Both surveys conclude that almost the half of the Slovak firms not even started to prepare for the entry into the single market. In spite of that, and paradoxically enough, the expectations of these firms are more than optimistic.

AB  - In Latin America and the Caribbean, river restoration projects are increasing, but many lack strategic planning and monitoring. We tested the applicability of a rapid visual social-ecological stream assessment method for restoration planning, complemented by a citizen survey on perceptions and uses of blue and green infrastructure. We applied the method at three urban streams in Jarabacoa (Dominican Republic) to identify and prioritize preferred areas for nature-based solutions. The method provides spatially explicit information for strategic river restoration planning, and its efficiency makes it suitable for use in data-poor contexts. It identifies well-preserved, moderately altered, and critically impaired areas regarding their hydromorphological and socio-cultural conditions, as well as demands on green and blue infrastructure. The transferability of the method can be improved by defining reference states for assessing the hydromorphology of tropical rivers, refining socio-cultural parameters to better address river services and widespread urban challenges, and balancing trade-offs between ecological and social restoration goals.

AB  - Two-years-old Sequoia sempervirens seedlings were foliar sprayed once and twice with chlorocholine chloride (CCC) at 0, 100, 500, 1000, 1 500 and 2 000 mg.l(-1). The purpose was to investigate the effect of CCC on the growth and photosynthetic activity of S. sempervirens seedlings under natural cooling and drought in autumn and winter. The findings showed that the increments of plant height and crown diameter were significantly decreased with the increase of chlorocholine chloride concentration, and the increment of root collar diameter, net photosynthetic rate, actual photochemical quantum yield and photosynthetic electron transport rate showed the trend of increasing first and then decreasing, and reached the maximum at concentrations of 1 000 similar to 2 000 mg.l(-1). There was not a significant difference between two applications and single application. It suggests that 1 000 similar to 2 000 mg.l(-1) chlorocholine chloride can protect the photosynthetic activity of S. sempervirens seedlings and alleviate the stress induced by low temperatures and drought in autumn and winter.

AB  - This paper examines the consideration of climate change in environmental assessment (EA) in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector, British Columbia, Canada. Based on an analysis of recent EA applications, results show that climate change is considered, to some extent, in all phases of EA for most LNG projects. However, stakeholders indicate a dissatisfaction with practice - often based on expectations about EA that exceed what it can deliver as a project-based tool, and sometimes based on an incomplete understanding of existing climate change legislation and targets. Results also indicate inconsistent application of existing climate change requirements across project EAs. Notwithstanding proponents often addressing climate change in their EA applications, climate change tends to receive little attention in project decision and approval conditions. The paper concludes with recommendations for better practice climate change consideration in EA that is commensurate with the scope and scale of project-level issues, complemented by more strategic EA and economic instruments.

AB  - During the last decade the search for novel biotechnologically valuable laccases/oxidases with a high redox potential and concomitant activity under neutral-alkaline conditions is an attractive and at the same time complicated task due to their rare occurrence in nature. By means of the modified micromethod based on the chromogenic reaction with indicator substrates the successful identification of laccases/oxidases with different pH-optimum was carried out during submerged cultivation of 71 fungal strains of different taxonomic groups. Based on more sensitivity (detected laccase activity can be 4-6 time less as compared with the usual spectrophotometric assay of laccase activity), good productivity (measurements of numerous samples at once in small total volume up to 150 mu L), economy and rapidity, the presented modification of chromogenic reaction can be applied for identification of trace amount of laccase/oxidase activity in biological liquids, to determine the chemoselectivity of induced laccase/oxidase isoforms with respect to pH-value of medium, and to monitor the dynamics of expression of alkaliphilic and acidophilic laccases/oxidases during submerged cultivation of fungi.

AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae becomes competent for genetic transformation when exposed to an autoinducer peptide known as competence-stimulating peptide (CSP). This peptide was originally described as a quorum-sensing signal, enabling individual cells to regulate competence in response to population density. However, recent studies suggest that CSP may instead serve as a probe for sensing environmental cues, such as antibiotic stress or environmental diffusion. Here, we show that competence induction can be simultaneously influenced by cell density, external pH, antibiotic-induced stress, and cell history. Our experimental data is explained by a mathematical model where the environment and cell history modify the rate at which cells produce or sense CSP. Taken together, model and experiments indicate that autoinducer concentration can function as an indicator of cell density across environmental conditions, while also incorporating information on environmental factors or cell history, allowing cells to integrate cues such as antibiotic stress into their quorum-sensing response. This unifying perspective may apply to other debated quorum-sensing systems.

AB  - In this study, marine environmental issues that occurred during the socio-economic development of Qingdao City and the exploitation and utilization of Jiaozhou Bay (JB) are reviewed. Its environmental condition has been dominated by intensive anthropogenic activities, i.e. increased wastewater discharge and rapid coastline evolution, which have reduced the ecosystem's ability to sustain itself. Efforts have been taken in scientific research and coastal management to protect and restore the environment in JB since 1990s. But lack of holistic views of JB system generates knowledge gaps in different research disciplines as well as the linkage between science and management. A case study is given to illustrate that different pollutant indicators respond to the coastline evolution differently, which cannot be explained by physics sole. The integrated research by knowledge sharing through community-benefit research projects is therefore called for on the systematic biogeochemical dynamics in JB. The integrated coastal zone management is also needed to cope with the complicated and complex systems of JB by an interdisciplinary problem-solving mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Given strong year-to-year variability, increasing competition for natural resources, and climate change impacts on agriculture, monitoring global crop and natural vegetation conditions is highly relevant, particularly in food insecure areas. Data from remote sensing image series at high temporal and low spatial resolution can help to assist in this monitoring as they provide key information in near-real time over large areas. The SPIRITS software, presented in this paper, is a stand-alone toolbox developed for environmental monitoring, particularly to produce clear and evidence-based information for crop production analysts and decision makers. It includes a large number of tools with the main aim of extracting vegetation indicators from image time series, estimating the potential impact of anomalies on crop production and sharing this information with different audiences. SPIRITS offers an integrated and flexible analysis environment with a user-friendly graphical interface, which allows sequential tasking and a high level of automation of processing chains. It is freely distributed for non-commercial use and extensively documented. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Western Australian (WA) Government wants to construct a large liquid natural gas processing precinct in the remote Kimberley region. The WA and Australian federal governments jointly conducted a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) of the Browse Precinct proposal. This article examines how the Browse SEA process affected the consideration of alternative development options and the management of social impacts. Resource development proposals often stimulate debate about the best means to achieve sustainable development outcomes and an SEA can provide a public space in which such social choices can be explored. However, the Browse SEA provided no such opportunity and this may have contributed to the severity of collateral social impacts. WA and federal SEA processes result in legally binding conditions of approval that can be applied to actions (e.g. projects) arising from a strategic proposal. This is a significant benefit to project proponents but can leave affected communities with high levels of uncertainty regarding their futures. This uncertainty is heightened by the fact that the SEA approval process cannot accommodate a broad range of social impacts.

AB  - The main objective of this contribution is to evaluate the environmental fidelity of dead diatom assemblages along two microtidal estuarine systems from southeastern Buenos Aires Province (Argentina). Living communities (inferred from counting protoplasm-containing cells) were compared to dead diatom assemblages through several fidelity metrics. Gradient analysis (by canonical correspondence analysis) was applied in order to assess the quantitative relationship between diatom assemblages and the environmental gradient. The presence of allochthonous components in diatom assemblages was assessed by analyzing the distribution of the main ecological groups. Results indicated a good agreement between living communities and total assemblages in surface sediments, as well as between total surface and subsurface assemblages from both estuaries. A high percentage of the variance in diatom assemblage composition was explained by the environmental gradient, particularly by sediment composition and salinity, indicating that taphonomic alterations play a minor role in structuring these assemblages. The good preservation of diatom thanatocoenoses in estuarine sediments makes them accurate indicators of the environmental conditions at the point of deposition, providing useful information for paleosalinity reconstructions in coastal settings.

AB  - While the basic premise of palaeoecological research is that the past and present can be linked, qualitatively or quantitatively, this has not been the case with much of the work in fungal spores and other non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs). This relates partly to the shortage of ecological data, especially in terms of microfungi on plants or in soils. To address this problem, modem samples have been analysed from moss and from subsurface soil from Quercus woodland in SW England. This paper reports modem fungal and pollen assemblage data from grazed and ungrazed sites in order to test the use of fungal NPMs as indicators of grazing in prehistory. Preliminary conclusions, based here on a small number of samples, suggest that spores of coprophilous fungi are, as expected, more prevalent in soil samples from grazed woodland, but that a zero count does not mean absence of animals. Other fungal types also respond to grazing through indirect mechanisms, probably due to changes in the abundance of host plants and ground conditions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Most methods of water quality evaluation focus on the community level using order, family or species, but few address the population or individual level. We studied whether larval fluctuating asymmetry (FA) observed in Hydropsyche exocellata is related to deterioration of water quality downstream in a Mediterranean river ecosystem greatly affected by urban and industrial activities. FA levels increased downstream in all traits measured, indicating that the selection of a few traits would suffice in FA studies related to environmental conditions. However, downstream changes differed in the first, second or third leg. Pearson correlations revealed a strong positive relationship between FA and chloride, conductivity and suspended solids for almost all traits, and between FA and phosphates only for the second leg traits. The study of FA in a pollution-tolerant macroinvertebrate such as H. exocellata may be a useful method to assess global water quality in Mediterranean rivers. Our study emphasizes the use of FA as an early warning technique to prevent the disappearance of species in ecosystems subjected to environmental stress.

AB  - The EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires the ecological assessment of water bodies. Since the littoral zones; and the lakeshores are part of lakes as water bodies as defined by the WFD, a new scheme for ecological quality assessment of lakeshores should be established. It is proposed that this scheme should go beyond the formal requirements of the WFD, as it includes aspects of nature conservancy, landscape protection, and regional planning and development. Some of these aspects are subject to other EU legislation (e.g. Habitats Directive) and some are subject to national legislation. Ten general Quality Elements (QEs) are proposed, which can be refined and reified through several levels of detail, depending on the specific aims of a study. A list of eleven topics, which should be discussed in the establishment of the lakeshore quality assessment scheme, is given. The more complex ones are the implementation of other EU legislation, the definition of lakeshore types and reference conditions, the stipulation of best aggregation procedures, and a better understanding of the significance of hydrological and morphological impacts on the biota.

AB  - The role of the energy industry has always been central for one reason or another, being environmentalism the main motive in the last two decades. Therefore, attention and research have been directed in this sense. However, human resources-or human capital-have remained understudied, especially concerning the salaries received. Thus, this study is disruptive as it explored the factors that influence employee remuneration in the energy subsector, using Spain as a case study. For this, the PLS-SEM (Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling) path modelling methodology was used, executing a traditional PLS analysis, bootstrapping and, finally, IPMA (Importance-Performance Analysis). Solid and significant relationships were found among labour conditions, human capital, market and wages, with the relationships between human capital and wages and between human capital and labour conditions being especially relevant. Besides, through IPMA, a series of considerations was made regarding the individual indicators according to their relative importance and performance. Consequently, this paper significantly contributes to the extant literature by analysing the composition of wages in the energy sector, which might allow taking valuable management decisions. Nevertheless, the main limitation of this study lies in the availability of data for Spain and, specifically, for workers in the energy supplying industries.

AB  - Surface water is the main source of water for human life and production. The quality of water affects living conditions and the overall health of people. Ecological protection and restoration engineering technology, combining ecological revetment and an ecological floating bed, is applied to a selected shallow beach experimentation area of a reservoir water source area in Northeast China. According to local conditions, the ecological revetment plants were identified as Goosegrass, sedges, and water grasses, and other local species of Polygonum hydropiper bagen, reeds, and bulrushes were identified as ecological floating bed plants. Regular monitoring of water quality in the experimentation area and a control area showed that the ecological protection and restoration technology can effectively reduce the concentrations of BOD5 (five day biochemical oxygen demand), COD (chemical oxygen demand), TN, NH3-N, NO3--N, TP, TDP, Mn, Zn, Fe, Pb, total coliforms, and other indicators of surface water in the experimentation area. The BOD5, COD, Max TN, NH3-N, NO3--N, TP, and TDP reduction rates were 84.76%, 57.14%, 86.76%, 83.78%, 89.26%, 94.02%, and 95.89%, respectively, with the implementation of water pollution prevention and the purifying shoal.

AB  - To analyze the coexistence between remaining structural conditions in the Territorio do Sisal and the emergence and strengthening of social activism is the central purpose of this article. To read this spatial context, we used the terms "permanence" and "emergencies", employed as a dialetic pair. The permanencies are manifested by the set of structural conditions and the historical particularity that was set up in the Territorio do Sisal (Bahia), recognized by the prevalence of the so-called physical and natural adversities related to drought, by a set of unfavorable social economic indicators exemplified by illiteracy, unemployment and among others, as well as the schemes of dominion and political clientelism. Emergencies are manifested in the mobilization and complexity of networks of social organizations, considered as social activism modality. This article is a result of a documental research and interviews with the most active social organization from Territorio do Sisal, during the years of 2010 and 2014. As a result, it was found that the social activisms of the Sisal Territory were searching for a political and moral direction conceived by social relations based on solidary cooperation, as well as on a more horizontal political and productive organization, and has been fighting for democratization of planning and public administration.

AB  - This study of a lee wave event over three-dimensional (3D) mountainous terrain in Lantau Island, Hong Kong, using a simulation combining mesoscale model and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has shown that (1) 3D steep mountainous terrain can trigger small scale lee waves under strong wind condition, and the horizontal extent of the wave structure is in a dimension of few kilometers and corresponds to the dimension of the horizontal cross-section of the mountain; (2) the life cycle of the lee wave is short, and the wave structures will continuously form roughly in the same location, then gradually move downstream, and dissipate over time; (3) the lee wave triggered by the mountainous terrain in this case can be categorized into "nonsymmetric vortex shedding" or "turbulent wake," as defined before based on water tank experiments; (4) the magnitude of the wave is related to strength of wind shear. This study also shows that a simulation combining mesoscale model and CFD can capture complex wave structure in the boundary layer over realistic 3D steep terrain, and have a potential value for operational jobs on air traffic warning, wind energy utilization, and atmospheric environmental assessment.

AB  - Ecotoxicity data constitute the basic information to support the derivation of ecological benchmark values, whatever the stressor concerned. However, the set of appropriate data may be limited, especially with regard to chronic exposure conditions. The available data are often biased in favor of acute data from laboratory-controlled conditions, much easier to acquire. To make the best use of the available knowledge and better inform the effects of ionizing radiation chronic exposure on nonhuman species, we investigated the transposition to ionizing radiation ecotoxicity of one method proposed for chemicals to extrapolate chronic information from acute toxicity data. Such a method would contribute to enriching chronic data sets required for the derivation of benchmark values, making them more robust when used as reference values for ecological risk assessment. We developed accordingly the Acute to Chronic Transformation for Radiotoxicity data (ACTR) approach, which we validated. We introduced then the new concept of Endpoint Sensitivity Distribution (ESD). This finally allowed us to compare purely chronic and ACTR-built ESDs for different taxa. For some of them, the predicted and observed distributions looked very similar. This promising ACTR method appeared applicable with a reasonable level of confidence, but its generalization asks for improvements, some being already identified.

AB  - The detection of fish by using environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has been shown to be more cost-effective than traditional sampling methods are in certain situations, but this method has not been assessed under extreme winter conditions. We conducted a multiyear pilot study to test the effectiveness of eDNA for detecting fish under ice. In the spring of 2016, 2017, and 2018, we sampled for juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in the Tanana Flats (Alaska, USA) by using minnow traps and by using eDNA in the spring of 2017 and 2018. We used traps at 97 sites and analyzed eDNA that was isolated from water samples at 36 sites, using an established, species-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay for Chinook Salmon. We detected Chinook Salmon by using eDNA at 12 of the 36 eDNA-sampled sites but did not capture any live juveniles in the minnow traps. Assuming that positive eDNA detections are reliable indicators of recent fish presence, we found that eDNA can be a more efficient and cost-effective alternative for monitoring aquatic communities under extreme winter conditions. Based on our experience, including eDNA-based screening of target sampling sites could prove to be a significant boost to the effectiveness of fish monitoring in remote and challenging habitats.

AB  - Aim. Selection and analysis of index images suitable for deciphering the vegetation cover in the conditions of inner mountain Dagestan.
   Methods. The study was carried out on the basis of multi-temporal satellite images of high spatial resolution, obtained by the imaging system of the Sentinel-2 series satellite, using methods of digital processing of geoimages. Processing was carried out using the capabilities of the Google Earth Engine geoservice.
   Results. Multi-temporal index images were obtained for the territory of inner mountain Dagestan. The time series of seasonal changes in the indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI) were analyzed, making it possible to reveal the phenological patterns of vegetation and to map the vegetation cover on this basis. Schemes for decoding vegetation have been created by which areas are distinguished according to the following characteristics: devoid of vegetation, herbaceous vegetation of varying degrees of density or woody (deciduous and coniferous).
   Conclusion. When studying vegetation cover using index images in a range of natural conditions, it is necessary to take into account the natural features of the territory, as well using additional sources of spatial information including field research methods.

AB  - Prognostics of rotating machines parts is an important subject in the maintenance field. The paper focuses on the contribution of the dynamic models for the development of reliable prognostics and diagnostics algorithms. The dynamic models enable prediction of changes in dynamic behavior reflecting the fault type and severity. New condition indicators and signal processing techniques can be developed based on these insights. The models can be used to build databases of simulated signals that can be used to perform sensitivity analysis with respect to geometrical tolerances, environmental and operating conditions, severity, type, and location of faults. A research methodology towards physics-based prognostics of rotating machinery is proposed. The methodology combines experiments with comprehensive dynamic models, and it is demonstrated with examples of rolling-element bearings, gear transmissions, and cardan joints.
   It is important to well validate the models and to assure their completeness. Therefore, experiments and models are complementary: the experimental results should be used to validate the model assumptions, and the models enable comprehensive interpretation of the test results. The combination of the two allow the generalization of the conclusions and algorithms with a high level of confidence. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - For nexus approaches to be successful in their analysis and influence, integration dynamics must be understood in the context of larger power dynamics. Current analysis barely take this dimension into account. In this article, we aim to delimit and understand the power-related enabling conditions for integration processes in a situation of water, food and energy conflicts in Cambodia. To do so, we reflect on our experiences and outcomes in a knowledge co-production approach for identifying nexus indicators in a WWF Conservation Mekong Flooded Forest Landscape. We conduct an analysis of stakeholder and partner qualitative interview data collected within the LIVES (Linked Indicators for Vital Ecosystem Services) project to explore three examples how we engaged with power dynamics in the course of the research. By doing so, this article provides first (1) learning on existing challenges regarding integration in the nexus, then (2) it analyses effects of coproduction processes when considering power dynamics in the nexus both in terms of stalemate and enabling conditions for reinforced integration. Finally (3), this article analyses the role that plays structure and agency in such integration processes.

AB  - Using wild and laboratory animals, we studied the food preference of bank voles, Clethrionomys glareolus, as a function of sex and reproductive status. Wild voles were captured in winter and early spring in central Finland, and during one day of captivity, were examined for food preferences. Pregnant females consumed significantly larger quantities of food rich in animal oil and protein than did non-reproductive females and males. Food preferences of pregnant females may indicate that spring breeding is constrained by access to fat and animal protein. Non-reproductive males showed a preference for spruce seeds, which may indicate a specific value of spruce seeds for this group, possibly related to the maturation process. Species-specific food constraints can differ between sexes and across seasons. Tests with laboratory animals revealed that voles prefer both artificial and unfamiliar food items over their staple diet. These data suggest that food choice in voles may have an unlearned component, and that animals can make adaptive food choices under experimental conditions. We suggest that food preference under experimental conditions can be a useful indicator for food constraints in the wild.

AB  - It has been suggested that fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in secondary sexual traits may be a useful indicator of either individual quality or environmental stress. We tested this concept using a series of analyses of FA in male antler size in a wild red deer (Cervus elaphus) population, using four measures of size repeated across successive years on the same individuals. We found no consistent evidence of correlations between traits in levels of FA, nor of any associations between known environmental or developmental conditions. None of the four measures of FA showed a significant heritability (average h(2) = 0.041), nor was there any evidence of inbreeding depression. For three of the four traits, fluctuating asymmetry did not predict either annual or lifetime breeding success. However there were significant associations between breeding success and FA in antler length. Given the series of null results in our other tests, it seems likely that this was a direct mechanistic effect rather than because measures of FA were indicative of individual quality or condition.

AB  - In this work, two egg-shaped, 5L-volume, anaerobic sludge digesters were used, one under mesophilic conditions (35 degreesC, M1), and the other under thermophilic conditions (55 degreesC, T1), Both digesters were fed with the purged sludge from an anaerobic treatment plant (start-up period) and from an activated sludge plant (stabilization period), treating municipal wastewaters. The purpose of the study was to establish the technical feasibility of the anaerobic thermophilic sludge treatment comparatively, during the stages of start-up and stabilization of the process, for removing pathogenic microorganisms and parasites efficiently. The results show that, in both stages, the anaerobic thermophilic digester presents higher efficiency on the removal of pathogens and parasites, than the mesophilic digester. Anaerobic thermophilic digestion is close to complying with the EPA (1996) limits for "Class A" type biosolids, referring to the number of parasitic helminth eggs (0.25 HELarval/gTS), and to the pathogen indicator fecal coliforms (< 1000 MPN/gTS). Therefore, the results show that thermophilic anaerobic digestion of biologic sludge may be considered as a suitable technology for the production of Class A biosolids, for further use in agriculture without restrictions.

AB  - Economic analysis allows for determining the required daily output under certain natural and mining conditions based on the costs of the production process in a particular mine infrastructure. Therefore, there is a need to determine the potential daily output of a longwall using the technical equipment at the disposal of the mine. In the case of mines, when exploiting a few longwalls simultaneously in the conditions of bumping hazards, it is indispensable to ensure safety. Due to a necessity of keeping a safe distance among the longwall fronts, when planning their exploitation, developing a prediction of the longwalls in advance during the planning period is needed. To predict the daily production from a longwall and daily advance of the longwall in the analyzed period, it is necessary to know the current operating time of machines and the capacity of the shearer under given conditions. The current working time of machines results from the available time and the degree of its utilization, which is determined by the sum of unplanned breaks in the production process. The shearer productivity is determined by its haulage speed. Both factors mentioned above are random. Hence, a calculation module has been developed, whose task is to estimate the distribution parameters of these indicators based on empirical data. The algorithm for estimating the parameters of one of the distributions: normal, steady or gamma and its special case of the exponential distribution and Poisson for the obtained input empirical data, constituting a sample from the population, is proposed. The input data are a sequence of numbers obtained from the measurement of the current operating time of machines. These data can be obtained from the longwall shearer memory card, on which its operating parameters are recorded in each longwall. On this basis, it is possible to generate random values of both parameters for individual days of operation. The possibility of determining the haulage speed, based on the longwall shearer's characteristics obtained from the computer simulation of the mining process, is also discussed. The simulation of the mining process is carried out using the GeneSiSv.3.1 software, developed for designing a picks layout on the drum. The characteristics of the shearer production potential also take into account the capacity of loading the cutting drum. It results from the presented characteristics that, when mining coal with a compressive strength of 27 MPa, the haulage speed is limited by the loading capacity of the cutting drum and, with greater cuttability, by the power of the electric motor driving the drum. The paper presents algorithms describing the procedure of generating random values necessary for determining the longwall production potential and the daily advance during the assumed period. The subject matter presented in the paper is part of a bigger project which concerns planning of a mine operation and developing a few longwalls in the conditions of bumping hazards.

AB  - Chemoattractants monocyte protein-1 (MCP-1) is a low molecular weight cytokine, secreted by many cells of the body. The synthesis of MCP-1 can induce the lipopolysaccharides of bacteria, a range of cytokines. It is believed that MCP-1 regulates the migration and infiltration of tissue by monocytes, T-lymphocytes memory, natural killer cells, is involved in differentiation of naive T-helper cells. There is evidence oncogenic and antitumor activity of MCP-1 at different stages of tumor progression. The aim of this work was the determination and comparison of serum level of MCP-1 by infection with Helicobacter (H.) pylori in precancerous conditions and gastric cancer. Material and methods. Surveyed with the informed consent 204 patients with precancerous diseases of the stomach, 40 patients with gastric cancer and 40 healthy volunteers. Patients at esophagogastroduodenoscopy conducted the fence of material for target biopsy for histological and microbiological studies. Blood on the immunoassay climbed in the morning on an empty stomach from the cubital vein in a volume of 5 ml in a vial without preserving agent, the serum was separated by centrifugation for 10 minutes. By ELISA in the serum of patients determined the level of MCP-1, titer of total antibodies to the cytotoxin-associated protein of H. pylori. The obtained data statistically processed. Results. The amount of MCP-1 in serum of the patients significantly exceeded the data of healthy individuals in all groups of comparison. Values of MCP-1 during exacerbation of gastric ulcer was higher than patients with exacerbation of chronic not atrophic and focal atrophic gastritis. The concentration of MCP-1 > 280 pg/ml was detected in 17.6% of patients with pre-cancerous conditions of the stomach. When ulceration process there was a strong direct correlation of the severity of its course and the number of MCP-1 in serum. Serum level of MCP-1 in 5.0% of patients with gastric cancer was at the upper limit of normal values, and 77.5% of patients exceeded it. Indicator in gastric cancer significantly prevailed over the values in precancerous conditions, was correlated with the tumor stage. The level of MCP-1 in serum of the examined healthy volunteers, patients with exacerbation of chronic gastritis, gastric ulcer disease, polyposis, gastric cancer was correlated with the titers of total antibodies to the cytotoxin-associated protein of H. pylori. Conclusion. Determination of serum level of MCP-1 in precancerous conditions and gastric cancer is diagnostically valuable. Comparison of indicator values with the titers of total antibodies to the cytotoxin-associated protein of IL pylori prognostically significant, as it allows to assess the intensity of the induction signal to production of a cytokine.

AB  - The article discusses the key challenges for the development of Russia's foreign trade in the modern conditions, analyzes the influence of the most important external factors on the dynamics of domestic exports and imports. Currently, the global merchandise trade is influenced by a complex of negative trends, the most important of which are increased protectionism and the spread of the epidemic of the new coronavirus. The projected slowdown in the global economy and in world trade poses a serious threat to the development of Russia's foreign trade, which is critically dependent on the influence of external factors, primarily the situation on energy markets. The paper presents the results of a quantitative assessment of the impact of change in the pricing environment on the value indicators of export, import and foreign trade balance of Russia in 2014-2018. The calculated total decrease in export value associated with a change in prices in 2014-2018 amounted to more than 40% of the actual value of exports for this period. Relatively high growth rates of physical volumes of export could not compensate for the losses from the deterioration of the terms of trade, given their scale. Based on the analysis, the article formulates proposals for improving Russia's foreign trade policy.

AB  - In the practical operation of compressors, both surge and deep stall are to be avoided. For a compressor, the minimum feasible flow is usually obtained in pre-operational tests. However, it will change during speed transients, which may cause serious security issues. Thus, an indicator that can recognize the stall severity at variable speeds is necessary. Dynamic tests are performed on an unshrouded centrifugal compressor. Real-time pressure fields at the tip clearance are captured under different operating conditions. Based on the chaos theory, the filtered one-dimensional signals are respectively reconstructed. A feature indicator is extracted to represent the chaotic bifurcation determinacy of the original signal. The indicators at different locations under variable conditions are analyzed in detail. A specific radial position at impeller outlet is found to be the best area to apply this recognition indicator. In particular, before the upcoming surge, the indicator at this special position will tend to a fixed value, which is irrelevant to the rotating speed, but has a certain relationship with both the filtering method and the experimental environment. This stall recognition indicator can effectively define the stall severity and prevent deep stall or surge, especially with varying speeds.

AB  - Horses are susceptible to a multitude of inflammatory conditions that are characterized by a strong neutrophilic response. Here, we review basic equine neutrophil biology and explore the role of neutrophils in inflammatory conditions with emphasis on intestinal ischemia and reperfusion injury and lung inflammation. In addition, unique aspects of equine neutrophil biology have been highlighted. Neutrophils comprise the highest proportion of circulating white blood cells in equine blood. The concentration of circulating equine neutrophils is a primary indicator of systemic inflammation. Additionally, equine neutrophils exposed to various stimulants develop "toxic" changes characterized as cytoplasmic basophilia, presence of Dohle bodies, cytoplasmic vacuolation and toxic granulation. In contrast to human neutrophils, equine neutrophils fail to undergo chemotaxis in response to the peptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine and are dependent on the addition of arachidonic acid due to reduced activity of phospholipase A(2) to synthesize leukotrienes as part of the arachidonic acid pathway. Understanding the biologic function of neutrophils in horses is integral to developing methods to modulate inflammation associated with ischemia reperfusion injury and lung disease.

AB  - Motorways are often seen as intrusive to both landscape and soundscape, and recent studies on multisensory perception suggest that an integrated assessment of the environmental impacts is necessary. This paper investigates the effects of traffic condition, distance to road and background landscape on the perceived integrated impact of noise and visual intrusion of motorways, and explores if noise exposure can be a powerful indicator for the perceived integrated impact. Six traffic conditions, consisting of three levels of noise emission x two levels of heavy good vehicle percentage in traffic composition, two types of background landscape and three distances to road, were designed as experimental scenarios, and created using computer visualisation and edited audio recordings. A laboratory experiment was carried out to obtain ratings of perceived environmental quality of each experimental scenario. The results show that traffic volume as expressed by noise emission level strongly influenced the perceived integrated impact, whereas traffic composition did not make noticeable differences. Distance to road was the second most influential factor, followed by background landscape. A regression model using noise level at receiver position and type of background landscape as independent variables was developed and can explain about a quarter of the variation in the perceived integrated impact.

AB  - As compared to other aquatic taxonomic groups, few studies have been conducted so far evaluating the potential risks of pesticides to amphibians. Furthermore, most existing studies with amphibians consist of acute laboratory toxicity tests that mostly only evaluated single peak pesticide exposure. In the present study, potential chronic effects of single and repeated abamectin applications on the survival and development of L. catesbeianus tadpoles under (semi-) field conditions were evaluated. To this end, tadpoles were housed in microcosms treated with single or repeated applications of abamectin (as the commercial product VertimecA (R) 18 EC). The single application level corresponded to the previously established laboratory 96 h LC50 of the test organism, whereas the repeated application was based on abamectin concentrations likely to occur in runoff water from agricultural areas where VertimecA (R) 18 EC is applied. Under semi-field conditions, toxicity after the single application was greater than would be expected from the laboratory toxicity value. Although the repeated application did not exert direct effects on tadpole survival, the observed delay in development may have pronounced effect on the fitness and survival of anuran populations in edge-of-field water bodies.

After the construction of an artificial weir on the coastal lagoon's canal outlet with Elefsina Bay, the water quality has improved and a short-term decrease in heavy metal concentrations in sediments is noted, which indicates a slow amelioration during the last decade. Nevertheless, the weir construction since the mid-1990s has changed the hydrological conditions of the wetland; it inevitably blocked marine fish movement and extirpated several fish species, while the area occupied by submerged aquatic vegetation has expanded due to the reduction in the lagoon water's salinity. In order to maintain the improved water quality and ecological potential of Koumoundourou Lake, the construction of a fish pass within the sluice is recommended that would allow the free passage of fishes (particularly gray mullet mugilidae). Although this is expected to affect the current hydraulic conditions of the lagoon and may increase the salinity and slightly decrease the time renewal of the water, the lagoon's ecological potential is expected to improve as the food web will be enriched.

AB  - The natural color of strawberries and their products easily fades or deteriorates during processing and storage. Temperature, pH, and light are common factors that affect the color stability of strawberry juice (Si). Clarified SJ was prepared from fresh fruits and diluted with purified water at a ratio of 1:3. The absorbance at 510 nm (Ab(510)) and the L* and a* values of Si under different processing or storage conditions were determined to describe the attributes and stability of juice color. SJ color was highly sensitive to thermal treatment, pH and sunlight exposure. Storage temperature also significantly affected the SJ color. SJ could achieve color stability by adjusting pH to 3.0 or below, heating at 80 degrees C or below for 20 min of less if thermal treatment is necessary, packing with opaque materials, and then storing at 2 degrees C 4 degrees C. Ab(510) positively correlated with a* under most conditions, except at different pH values. a* could be used as a direct indicator that describes Si color. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Iridium anomalies are commonly used as indicators of extraterrestrial processes which caused global extinctions. However, platinum-group element (PGE) anomalies may result from several different processes, both syn- and postdepositional, acting separately or jointly. The sources and processes of enrichment involved are: extraterrestrial (asteroid, comet, cosmic dust, impact ejecta); volcanogenic (PGE-rich condensates); precipitation from seawater (low sedimentation rate, anoxic conditions); microbial (concentration, dissolution, reprecipitation); exhalative-hydrothermal; leaching, transport and precipitation at a redox boundary.
   Geochemical characteristics of PGE and accompanying elements in sediments can be used to identify the contributions of some specific sources and processes: (1) extraterrestrial: chondritic Ru/Ir and Os/Ir ratios, low Os-187/Os-186 ratio, high Ir compared to Pt, Pd and Au; (2) volcanogenic: high iridium and Se, As, Sb and In contents; (3) exhalative-hydrothermal: high Au, Pd and Pt (relatively low Ir) contents; (4) precipitation from seawater: high Pt and low Pd contents, also high Cd and Ag contents under anoxic conditions; and (5) reduction from intermediate and low-temperature solutions: high PGE and Cu (or Mo, U, Ni) contents.

AB  - In the present work, the dynamic behaviour of surface albedo of a coupled soil vegetation-atmosphere (SVA) system has been studied in relation to landform characteristics, seasonally varying surface cover, and hydro-meteorological condition using multi-temporal Landsat TM data. Two adjacent, sharply contrasted and physiographically different land areas, ( 1) the semi-arid Barind Tract area and ( 2) the flood plain areas of the rivers Ganges and Mahananda situated in the northwestern part of Bangladesh, have been selected for this study. Spatio-temporal analysis of Landsat TM-derived spectral signatures manifests quite contrasted response characteristics for different physiographic land units in the two study sites and shows a seasonal trend that is consistent with field observations. Coupling of satellite-derived land cover information with landform and hydro-climatic data reveals that the observed variability in surface cover and its condition, as well as seasonal transformation of surface categories ( e. g. soil, vegetation, and water) over time and space, are a function of landform characteristics and the prevailing hydro-climatic condition of the area. Particularly, depth of flooding in relation to land elevation during the wet season in the flood plain areas and soil moisture deficit during the dry season in the Barind Tract area seemed to be the two major determinative variables governing land use of the area. Climatic variables, particularly precipitation, appear to be the main driving force that brings out the dynamic changes in the geo-environmental condition in both study sites. The changes in vegetation cover in response to the rainfall amount show a much higher sensitivity of the Barind tract areas in comparison to the flood plain areas. Land cover information as derived from multidate Landsat TM data demonstrates a relatively high change ( about 68 per cent) in the aerial extent of vegetation cover in the Barind Tract and a small change ( only about 8 per cent) in the flood plain areas between summer and the rainy season. The flood plain areas are found to be moderately vegetated throughout different seasons, which is in contrast to the semi-arid Barind Tract area that remains either mostly bare ( about 90 per cent) or highly vegetated ( vegetation cover greater than 75 per cent), depending on the season, though both sites receive an almost similar amount of seasonal and annual precipitation.
   Variation in soil moisture and vegetation condition, as well as transformation of bare land into a vegetated or seasonally flooded area in response to seasonally varying precipitation, introduce sequential variability in the surface absorption level, thereby provoking seasonal rhythmic variation in the surface albedo over the area. It is found that the transformation of bare land into a crop area in the Barind Tract reduces the surface albedo values by about 60-75 per cent. Relatively higher spectral responses in summer over most of the semi-arid area depict a deficit in moisture content in the soil layer, as compared to that in the relatively moist flood plain area, except the sandy area, whereas transformation of land into water due to seasonal flooding, especially in the flood plain areas in the wet season, associates a decrease in albedo from 13 per cent in summer to about 6 per cent in winter. Increased albedo, particularly over the river area in summer, indicates the presence of suspended sediments originating from erosion due to surface runoff and nearby riverbank shifting. As a whole, surface albedo seems to be a land type-dependent seasonal indicator of the area.

AB  - Background. Recurring escapes or deliberate releases and subsequent infiltration or establishment of feral populations by individuals from fur farms have been commonly noted since the beginning of fur industry expansion. Once animals have invaded ecosystems adjacent to source farms escapees can change the demography of the feral populations through hybridization, outbreeding depression, competition and spreading of various pathogens which can decimate wild populations. In our study, we aimed to assess spread of Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV) in the feral population of American mink (Neovison vison) in Iceland. The additional objective was to elucidate whether basic morpho-anatomical parameters (i.e., Fulton's condition factor or spleen to body weight ratio) might be used as a preliminary indicator of AMDV infection. Methods. American mink (n = 164) were captured by professional hunters in 8 regions of Iceland. The detection of AMDV in the spleen of male and female individuals was based on PCR amplification of an NS1 gene fragment. Results. We confirmed AMDV presence in 23.8% (n = 39) of collected samples with no significant difference in infection rate between males and females. Additionally, we revealed that the prevalence of virus in the feral population was higher closer to fur farms. However, the countrywide prevalence and direction of AMDV distribution needs to be further investigated. Comparison of condition indices in non-infected and infected animals showed significant deterioration of body and spleen parameters in the latter group. Therefore, the application of basic measurements of the American mink may be used to evaluate the health status of individuals in terms of pathogen infection. Conclusions. The study shed a new light on prevalence and distribution of AMDV in the feral population of American mink in Iceland and the results might be successfully applied to develop models to infer dynamics of various pathogens, even those latently transmitted by disease-free animals.

AB  - Sand and dust storms in arid and semiarid regions deteriorate regional air quality and threaten public health security. To quantify the negative effects of river dust on regional air quality, this study selected the estuary areas located in central Taiwan as a case study and proposed an integrated framework to measure the fugitive emission of dust from riverbeds with the aid of satellite remote sensing and wind tunnel test, together with the concentrations of particulate matter with a diameter of <10 mu m (PM10) around the river system by using The Air Pollution Model. Additionally, the effects of 25 types of meteorological conditions on the health risk due to exposure to dust were evaluated near the estuary areas. The results reveal landscape changes in the downstream areas of Da'an and Dajia rivers, with an increase of 370,820 m(2) and 1,554,850 m(2) of bare land areas in the dry season compared with the wet season in Da'an and Dajia rivers, respectively. On the basis of the maximum emission of river dust, PM10 concentration increases considerably during both wet and dry seasons near the two rivers. Among 25 different types of weather conditions, frontal surface transit, outer-region circulation from tropical depression system, weak northeast monsoons, and anticyclonic outflow have considerable influence on PM10 diffusion. In particular, weak northeast monsoons cause the highest health risk in the areas between Da'an and Dajia rivers, which is the densely populated Taichung City. Future studies should attempt to elucidate the environmental impact of dust in different weather conditions and understand the spatial risks to human health due to PM10 concentration. Facing the increasing threat of climate and landscape changes, governments are strongly encouraged to begin multimedia assessments in environmental management and propose a long-term and systematic framework in resources planning.

AB  - Background. In the United States, an estimated 14,748 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) provide wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal service to more than 230 million people. The quality of treated wastewater is often assessed by the presence or absence of fecal indicator bacteria. UV disinfection of wastewater is a common final treatment step used by many wastewater treatment plants in order to reduce fecal coliform bacteria and other pathogens; however, its potential impacts on the total effluent bacterial community are seemingly varied. This is especially important given that urban WWTPs typically return treated effluent to coastal and riverine environments and thus are a major source of microorganisms, genes, and chemical compounds to these systems. Following rainfall, stormflow conditions can result in substantial increases to effluent flow into combined systems.
   Methods. Here, we conducted a lab-scale UV disinfection on WWTP effluent using UV dosage of 100 mJ/cm(2) and monitored the active microbiome in UV-treated effluent and untreated effluent over the course of 48 h post-exposure using 16S rRNA sequencing. In addition, we simulated stormflow conditions with effluent UV-treated and untreated effluent additions to river water and compared the microbial communities to those in baseflow river water. We also tracked the functional profiles of genes involved in tetracycline resistance (tetW) and nitrification (amoA) in these microcosms using RT-qPCR.
   Results. We showed that while some organisms, such as members of the Bacteroidetes, are inhibited by UV disinfection and overall diversity of the microbial community decreases following treatment, many organisms not only survive, but remain active. These include common WWTP-derived organisms such as Comamonadaceae and Pseudomonas. When combined with river water to mimic stormflow conditions, these organisms can persist in the environment and potentially enhance microbial functions such as nitrification and antibiotic resistance.

AB  - Co-digestion of swine manure with glycerine was studied by thermal analysis (TA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Co-digestion experiments were performed under batch conditions at different organic loadings by increasing the volumetric percentage of glycerine in the mixture. Batch results were used for evaluating the performance of the process under semi-continuous conditions in an attempt to study the characteristics of the digested material. Batch tests demonstrated a successful digestion at a glycerine volumetric addition of 16% (v/v), whilst failure of the semi-continuous digestion process was reported at 8%. The different operating regimes explained the discrepancy in these outcomes, therefore, indicating that results from batch tests should not be directly extrapolated to estimate continuous performance. The addition of glycerine at high percentage negatively affected the digestion under semi-continuous conditions, resulting in the accumulation of volatile fatty acids and high H2S evolution in biogas. These characteristics were accompanied by a decrease in the conversion of the organic matter as reported from the thermal evaluation of digested samples. TA represents a good indicator of the stabilisation attained when evaluating the fate of complex materials during biological transformations. DSC demonstrated to be a superior tool when evaluating the course of digestion and the quality of the organic material obtained. The failure stage (8% glycerine content) reported a mass change of 25.3 +/- 0.5% for the complex materials, which represented an increase of 17% when evaluated against the successful digestion at 4% glycerine content. In this same line, when the enthalpy is considered, these complex materials contribute an increase of 22% in the digested sample of the failure stage. This enthalpy value calculated for the complex materials (temperature region of 370-575 degrees C) greatly aids in assessing degradation. Therefore, the need of a stabilisation stage for co-digestion systems with a high content of readily degradable material was highly recommended.

AB  - Water is a key resource in commercial wine production and both large excesses and deficits have undesirable effects upon the amount and quality of the wine produced. A balance between the water requirements of a fully developed canopy and the induced stress necessary for the commercial quality of the wine must be reached. Thus we need a physiological indicator that integrates both soil and climatic conditions to use as a management tool. An experimental field was established in the eastern part of the Demarcated Region of Douro - Portugal, to study the effect of water supply on the quality of the musts produced and we need a physiological indicator that relates to the water use and stress of the grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.) and to the later evaluation of the effect of irrigation practices upon the quality of the musts. We chose as indicators sap flow, leaf water potential at pre-dawn (0600 h), mid-morning (1000 h), solar noon (1400 h) and sunset (1900 h), stomatal conductance and leaf transpiration both measured at mid-morning and at solar noon, and related them to our experimental treatments that induce differences in soil water content, evaluated with time-domain reflectometry probes, with the objective of selecting the indicator that best describes the plant water status under different amounts of available water. Sap flow, leaf water potential and leaf transpiration rate measured at solar noon had highly significant correlations with soil water content and their regression on soil water content was also highly significant. Each of these parameters has shortcomings and none has a clear advantage over the other two as an integrator of the environmental conditions under these experimental conditions. Further studies of the parameters and their relationship with the quality characteristics of the produced musts are needed to achieve the ultimate objective of manipulating the soil water content.

AB  - The article introduces and exemplifies the approach of evidence-based narratives (EBN). The methodology is a product of co-design between policy-making and science, generating robust intelligence for evidence-based policy-making in the Directorate General for Research and Innovation of the European Commission (DG RTD) under the condition of high uncertainty and fragmented evidence. The EBN transdisciplinary approach tackles practical problems of future-oriented policy-making, in this case in the area of programming for research and innovation addressing the Grand Societal Challenge related to climate change and natural resources. Between 2013 and 2018, the EU-funded RECREATE project developed 20 EBNs in a co-development process between scientists and policy-makers. All EBNs are supported with evidence about the underlying innovation system applying the technological innovation systems (TIS) framework. Each TIS analysis features the innovation, its current state of market diffusion and a description of the innovation investment case. Indicators include potential future market sizes, effects on employment and environmental and social benefits. Based on the innovation and TIS function analyses, the EBNs offer policy recommendations. The article ends with a critical discussion of the EBN approach.

AB  - Shrinking cities have become almost ubiquitous during the long transition of post-industrial America. While many fear population losses to be a harbinger of economic decline, others have argued that the economic and demographic transition of a shrinking city need not be a death knell for those urban communities. In this study, we conduct an analysis of more than 10,000 U.S. census tracts experiencing population loss in order to better understand the variegated nature of population decline in the United States. Using high-dimensional cluster analysis, we classify tracts into seven distinct groups, and then assess group differences based on population characteristics and built environment indicators. Our findings show inter- and intraregional characteristics that are far from uniform. Our results imply that public policy responses cannot be developed as a one-size-fits-all strategy, nor should the outlook of urban shrinkage be understood as a nationally uniform crisis. Future work can build upon our typological definitions to offer additional insights valuable to local decision makers and leaders regarding the complex relationship between demographic change and associated socio-economic outcomes.

AB  - Hydroid assemblage's responses to organic contamination were evaluated using sedimentary sterols as explanatory variables. At seven coral reef sites in the Havana west coast, hydroids were collected along three 10 m x 1 m, 10 m deep transects. Five sterols were analysed, i.e., coprostanol, an indicator of faecal contamination, and cholestanol, cholesterol, stigmasterol and brassicasterol, indicators of biogenic organic matter inputs. The sampling sites were classified by level of contamination. A total of 65 species comprised the hydroid assemblages. Hydroids community abundance and richness decreased in the contaminated sites. Coprostanol had the highest relative importance for these variables and also for Plumularia fioridana and Clytia gracilis abundances. Obelia dichotoma and Haleciwn bermudense were relatively abundant in the contaminated sites. The results indicate that faecal contamination negatively affected the hydroid assemblages, highlighting the importance of integrated biological and chemical indicators to evaluate the environmental conditions of the Havana coral reef.

AB  - Located at a subtropical latitude, the expansive Florida Everglades contains a mixture of tropical and temperate diatom taxa, as well as a unique flora adapted to the calcareous, often excessively hot, seasonally flooded wetland conditions. This flora has been poorly documented taxonomically, although diatoms are recognized as important indicators of environmental change in this threatened ecosystem. Gomphonema is a dominant genus in the freshwater marsh, and is represented by highly variable species complexes, including Gomphonema gracile Ehrenberg, Gomphonema intricatum var. vibrio Ehrenberg sensu Fricke, Gomphonema vibrioides Reichardt & Lange-Bertalot and Gomphonema parvulum (Kutzing) Grunow. These taxa have been shown to exhibit wide morphological variation in other regions, resulting in considerable nomenclatural confusion. We collected Gomphonema from 237 sites distributed throughout the freshwater Everglades and used qualitative and quantitative morphological data to identify 20 distinguishable populations. Taxonomic assignments were based on descriptions and/or observations of type material of relevant taxa when possible, but deviations from original morphological range descriptions were common. We then compared morphological variation in Everglades Gomphonema taxa to that reported for the same taxa in other regions and suggest revisions of taxonomic concepts when necessary.

AB  - Surface sediments from the Laptev Sea and adjacent continental slope were studied for their composition of particulate organic matter (OM) by means of maceral analysis. The composition of macerals in sediments gives information about the environment, terrigenous supply from the hinterland, and marine OM. With reference to their biological sources, we distinguish between terrigenous and marine macerals. We found that the particulate OM in the surface sediments of the Laptev Sea is predominantly of terrigenous origin (empty set: 78%). However, distinct variations exist when looking in detail. In the shelf area, sediments may contain up to 99% terrigenous OM. Freshwater algae occur directly north of the river mouths, reflecting the strong fluvial influence. Relatively high amounts of marine OM (20-40%) are restricted to the upper continental slope, the Vilkitsky Strait and west of the New Siberian Islands, explained by increased surface-water productivity due to increased fluvial nutrient supply, open-water conditions, and phytoplankton blooms at the ice-edge.

AB  - Researchers aim to design environmental studies that optimize precision and allow for generalization of results, while keeping the costs of associated held and laboratory work at a reasonable level. Ranked set sampling is one method to potentially increase precision and reduce costs by using 'rough but cheap' quantitative or qualitative information to obtain a more representative sample before the real, more expensive sampling is done. In this report, we investigate under what conditions ranked set sampling becomes a cost-effective sampling method for ecological and environmental field studies where the 'rough but cheap' measurement has a cost. Ratios of measuring to ranking costs necessary for ranked set sampling to be as cost effective as simple random sampling, for a common precision, are presented for known distributions with and without ranking error. Cost ratios are also presented for a real data set consisting of visually estimated and physically measured stream habitat areas. Results provide specific guidelines for when ranked set sampling is appropriate, and cost effective, for ecological and environmental field sampling. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - THIS STUDY presents the assessment and mapping of the environmentally sensitive areas (ESA) to desertification in Sidi-Abdel Rahman area, Northern West Coast of Egypt using MEDALUS model. The desertification indices in Sidi-Abdel Rahman area were identified based on remote sensing data, Geographic information Systems (GIS), and field survey data. These indices were soil quality index, climate quality index, vegetation quality index, erosion quality index, land management quality index, and social quality index. The results of the current study for sensitivity to desertification showed that 20.62% of the whole region (8510 ha) is medium-fragile sensitive to desertification, 43.36% (17893 ha) is high-fragile sensitive to desertification, 35.35% (14586 ha) is low-critical sensitive to desertification, and 0.66% (274 ha) is medium-critical to desertification. In general, the total area is classified as fragile (F3) and thus insensibly susceptible to desertification. Sidi-Abdel Rahman area is sensitive to desertification owing to low vegetation cover, soil quality, mismanagement, climate condition, wind, and water erosion.

AB  - Climate change is increasingly accepted as a major worldwide issue, bringing with it a host of long-term consequences for both human beings and ecosystems. To more effectively limit the damage caused by natural hazards and global change, it is essential that we gain a greater understanding of the complex question of social vulnerability-a subject that has been widely discussed in the literature. This paper examines the use of a conceptual "human wellbeing'' framework to analyse vulnerability. It also proposes an innovative statistical method (ClustOfVar) to capture the multidimensional nature of that vulnerability. Using our approach, it is possible to construct composite indicators of residents' living conditions at municipality level. To test our methodology, we carried out a comprehensive evaluation of the development of residents' quality of life for two specific years (1999 and 2009) in areas close to the Garonne and Gironde rivers in southwest France. The results reveal different municipality trajectories in terms of quality of life profiles. This study helps to understand the multivariate characteristics of communities with higher social vulnerability.

AB  - Water Quality (WQ) condition is based on ecosystem stressor indicators (e.g. water clarity) which are biogeochemically important and critical when considering the Deepwater Horizon oil spill restoration efforts under the 2012 RESTORE Act. Nearly all of the proposed RESTORE projects list restoring WC as a goal, but 90% neglect water clarity. Here, dynamics of optical constituents impacting clarity are presented from a 2009-2011 study within Pensacola, Choctawhatchee, St. Andrew and St Joseph estuaries (targeted RESTORE sites) in Northwest Florida. Phytoplankton were the smallest contribution to total absorption (a(t-w)PAR) at 412 nm (5-11%), whereas colored dissolved organic matter was the largest (61-79%). Estuarine a(t-w)PAR was significantly related to light attenuation (K(d)PAR), where individual contributors to clarity and the influence of climatic events were discerned. Provided are conversion equations demonstrating interoperability of clarity indicators between traditional State-measured WQ measures (e.g. secchi disc), optical constituents, and even satellite remote sensing for obtaining baseline assessments.

AB  - Neopedies brunneri (Giglio-Tos, 1894) is a grasshopper belonging to the family Acrididae. This group of insects usually has economic importance in Argentina because of their ability to experience outbreaks, but little is known about them. Insect populations usually differ at the phenotypic level, often according to geographical and environmental variables, which may be a good indicator of some other factors with adaptive significance (such as developmental rate, seasonal resource disposal, and growing seasonal length). The aim of this article is to report the first preliminary analysis of phenotypic variation in natural populations of N. brunneri from central Argentina to study the amount of intra-and interpopulation variation in morphometric traits and their probable association with geographic and climatic variables. We found the existence of morphometrical differences among populations and a pattern of geographical variation, with males and females from eastern populations being larger than the ones from the west. Sexual size dimorphism was also detected and found to be correlated to geographical and climactic variation. Moreover, geographic patterns of sexual size dimorphism were determined, helping to clarify differential susceptibility of both sexes to environmental conditions.

AB  - To assess the environmental impacts of large floating structures, various physical, chemical, and biological parameters were measured. The current and water quality were monitored around a prototype floating structure called the Phase-II Mega-Float model (MF-II model), which was moored off Yokosuka in Tokyo Bay during the period 1999-2000. The effects of the MF-II model on the condition of the physical environment, e.g., the direction and flow rate of water currents and the stratification structure, were negligible. Analysis of water quality showed that the concentrations of chlorophyll a and nutrients only varied just below the MF-II model. However, such variations were localized to within 5 m below the MF-II model since the waters were exchanged because of the tidal current. The minor changes in water quality are attributable to the impedance of photosynthesis due to the sea-covering effect and the activities of sessile organisms fouling the bottom surface of the MF-II model.

AB  - Tree species distribution according to climatic gradients is often analysed through geographic information systems modelling whereas their nutrient requirements is mainly studied by experimentation. Using 325 forest plots, this study analysed the response of frequent tree species in the Vosges mountains, a siliceous area in northeast France, along both climate and nutrient gradients. Besides a better understanding of species behaviour, our aim was to investigate if indicator plants can be used to accurately estimate species response to ecological factors. Results showed a main effect of climate on Abies alba and Quercus petraea with a transition between both species around - 20 mm of June water balance. They also showed a combined effect of climate, base saturation and nitrogen nutrition on Acer pseudoplatanus, Carpinus betulus, Fraxinus excelsior and Pinus sylvestris distribution. Nutritional and climatic variables estimated by Ellenberg indicator values or those established with the phytoecological database EcoPlant are almost as efficient as measured variables to assess tree species ecological response.

AB  - Assemblages of archaeological insect (mainly Coleoptera) remains from in and around Anglo-Scandinavian buildings at 16-22 Coppergate, York, were investigated in order to identify associations between pairs and groups of species, and to determine the significance of those associations as indicators of past human activity and living conditions. Following initial exploration, a pairwise measure of association was used to establish working groups of co-occurring species, which were then related to their likely habitats. Detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA) was used to test the groups. Robust and consistent species associations were identified among the death assemblages. The groups defined by the analyses usually corresponded to the ecological preference of species, although some groups of species would not be found together at the present day. Some groups probably represented complexes of habitats that occurred together in the past, and not single communities, and some may be peculiar to Coppergate and similar sites. It is suggested that the species associations are of value in assemblage interpretation, and that variations in associations among sites will reflect archaeologically significant aspects of the sites.

AB  - Vital population parameters, such as growth, survival, recruitment, reproduction, distribution, and abundance, are the consequences of life history modes to which fish stocks have evolved. Differences in these parameters have long been used to identify separate management stocks assuming that phenotypic variation is due to genotypic and environmental controls. However, few studies have examined the temporal stability of life history parameters, nor the mechanisms by which differences in these parameters between stocks are maintained. We examine the temporal and spatial stability of several life history parameters of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), and yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea) in the northwest Atlantic Ocean to assess their utility for stock identification. Although significant temporal differences in vital rates were found within stocks, differences were generally maintained between stocks. Both genetic (biological) and oceanographic (physical) conditions play an integral role in maintaining stock structure. Although, the utility of vital life history parameters for stock identification may decrease with stock complexity and exploitation history, their applicability increases with the number of parameters examined.

AB  - Pocket gophers have been considered as both serious pests to management of natural resources and critically important to the function of ecosystems. Assessments of their positive and negative impacts have relied largely on population density and behavior. However, 100 reported estimates of pocket gopher density from 32 published studies varied 415-fold from low to high density, and much of this variation can be explained by the 1,000-fold range in spatial extent of study area. Unlike mammalian carnivores, however, body mass explained a significant portion of the variation in density, even after adjusting density by size of the study area. Nearly all variation in density can be explained by study area and female body mass estimated at the corresponding study site. Residual variation in density differed significantly but not substantially among categories of dominant vegetation and land use, and among species. Pocket gopher density is spatially dependent, and therefore should not be compared among species, populations, or localities without defining the estimate to spatial scale. Further research across large areas and a range of conditions will be required to fully understand the factors that influence distribution and abundance of gophers.

AB  - In January 1998, a project studying the Unification of Indicator Quality for Assessment of Impact of Multidisciplinary Systems (UNIQUAIMS) began at IACR-Rothamsted. This three year European Union-funded project will examine the choice of indicators for the assessment of the sustainability and impact of multidisciplinary systems. The project links 27 developing country and European partners to clarify methods and rationalize indicators for assessing impact and sustainability in three priority areas: farming systems, ecosystems converted to agricultural use and degraded ecosystems. The results will be disseminated to national and regional agricultural research institutes, extension agents, research planners and policymakers to promote improved interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral management of natural resources. A strong socioeconomic component is involved. This paper describes the scientific and policy issues which led to the project and focuses upon the need to: clarify current methods of impact and sustainability assessment; identify key qualitative and quantitative indicators for both baseline and on-going studies and their relevance at different scales, allowing for the balance between standardization and responsiveness to local conditions; and establish sound guidelines for indicator collection procedures at all stages of research, from project conception through to impact and sustainability assessment.

AB  - More than 30 Pennsylvanian coal seam profiles from different wells of the Ruhr Basin, Western Germany, have been studied by means of organic petrology and organic geochemistry. Published information obtained over the past three decades and new data provide a vast data set from which information on peat deposition, diagenesis and petroleum potential has been deduced.
   The coal seams reflect dynamically changing environmental conditions, generally in a permanently humid tropical climate. Water covered topogenous peats result in sulphur- and ash-rich coals, dominated by vitrinite, whereas seasonally dry, ombrogenous peats produce sulphur- and ash-poor coals rich in inertinite. For the rather thick (0.6 to 2 m) coal seams investigated, a predominance of ombrogenous facies can be deduced.
   Under marine influence, more syngenetic pyrite precipitated in the peats leading to coals with partly more than 3 wt.% total sulphur. Sulphur content of coals is thus an excellent indicator of marine conditions after peat growth. High sulphur contents are not only restricted to the top of the seams, but occur in the lower parts as well, indicating effective exchange of pore water at the peat stage.
   In the Ruhr Basin, vitrinite reflectance usually increases regularly with depth reaching values between 0.6 and 1.2% (VRr, mean reflectance on randomly oriented particles) in the here studied coals. Higher values and thus more mature coals up to the anthracite stage occur as well in deeper and older strata, but are much less suitable for studies on depositional conditions due to strong thermal overprint. Vitrinite reflectance is mainly dependant on maximum temperatures reached during maximum burial depth during the latest Pennsylvanian/earliest Permian. However, there is some scatter in reflectance values within single coal seams (up to about 0.1%), which cannot be attributed to maximum burial and temperature. Primary plant precursor material of huminite/vitrinite and early diagenetic conditions are regarded critical for vitrinite reflectance up to the medium-high volatile bituminous coal stage (about 1.0% vitrinite reflectance). In particular enhanced sulphate reduction during the peat stage seems to affect the vitrinite precursor material leading to low reflectivity as compared to "normal" coals.
   Interestingly, coals preserve much of their hydrocarbon generation potential up to the high-medium bituminous coal stage (about 1.0% VRr), i.e. up to stages in which type I and II kerogen-bearing source rocks have already realised most of their petroleum generation potential. Data on Ruhr Basin coal seams and adjacent clastic sedimentary rocks indicate that this applies only to coal seams. The limited expulsion efficiency of coals is related to both their microporosity (pore diameter less than 2 nm) and polarity of pore walls, leading to retention of a large part of the generated bitumen.

AB  - Accurate thunderstorm warnings in the hours-to-minutes preceding impact are often limited by the complex evolution of the mesoscale atmospheric environment. To accurately capture these complexities, analysis of observations remained central to operational short-term nowcasting predictions of thunderstorms. Over the past 40 years, multiple high-impact thunderstorm events have impacted the Brisbane Metropolitan Area (BMA) of South East Queensland resulting in significant insured losses. Four of these high-impact events were the focus of the following work. These cases included three events that resulted in the greatest insured losses for the BMA, exceeding AU$4 billion (2017) (18 January 1985. 16 November 2008 and 27 November 2014) and a fourth significant event (24 December 1989). Synthesis of previous work indicates that the four high-impact cases occurred during a south-easterly change with strengthening winds ahead of the change, suggesting commonalities may exist that can be exploited for forecasting. This paper provides a detailed observational analysis of the environment and convective storms from the four BMA events to explore discriminating characteristics that may improve the skill of nowcasting. For the four BMA events, significant deep convection was observed along the change for the hours prior to the change's arrival at the Brisbane Airport, potentially acting as an early indicator of favourable conditions for high-impact thunderstorms. It was found that the timing of the south-easterly change through Brisbane was also highly correlated for all events, occurring within a 90-min window during the mid-afternoon convective heating maximum. Despite the destructive severe weather, upper air conditions were marginal for supporting organised thunderstorms, highlighting the importance of capturing mesoscale processes, such as the south-easterly change. To further understand possible discriminators of the four high-impact BMA cases, a 10-year climatology of the mesoscale and synoptic environment associated with south-easterly change events was developed for the warm season months of November to January. It is shown that although only a small number of events are associated with high-impact BMA thunderstorms, these events share a set of conditions relating to the prechange wind shift, timing of the south-easterly change and radar signatures.

AB  - The organic-rich shale of the Longtan Formation of the Upper Permian in western Guizhou formed during the marine-continental transitional facies depositional environment. With a high total organic carbon (TOC) content and a large cumulative thickness, it is thought to be the superior source rock for shale gas development. The depositional environment of marine-continental transitional shale is significantly different from marine shale, which leads to the various accumulation characteristics of the organic matter. In this paper, shale samples were collected from the Longtan Formation of the Upper Permian, which is typical marine-continental transitional shale. The TOC, major elements and trace elements were measured, and the formation and preservation conditions were investigated using multiple geochemical proxies, including paleoclimate, detrital influx, redox parameters, paleoproductivity and sedimentation rate. The TOC decreases first and then increases from the bottom to the top of the Longtan Formation shale, and the TOC for the lower Longtan Formation is higher than the upper Longtan Formation. For the lower Longtan Formation, the positive correlations between TOC and redox indicators (V, U and V/Cr) demonstrate that the dysoxic bottom water environment was the key factor that controlled the accumulation of organic matter. For the upper Longtan Formation, there are positive correlations between the TOC and the paleoclimate and sedimentation rate, which suggests that the enrichment of the organic matter was influenced by both a warm and humid paleoclimate and the high sedimentation rate of an oxic environment. However, the high detrital influx (aluminosilicate) occurred as the diluent decreased the concentration of organic matter. The paleoproductivity has a poor correlation with TOC for the Longtan Formation, suggesting that it was inferior to the gathering of organic matter. The sedimentary models built for the upper and lower Longtan Formation shale can reproduce the enrichment of organic matter.

AB  - Ideal weed-competitive rice (Oryza sp.) varieties are high yielding under both weed-free and weedy conditions, and have strong weed-suppressive ability (WSA). WSA is the ability to suppress weed growth and reduce weed seed production, benefiting weed management in both the current and the subsequent growing seasons. WSA is determined by assessing weed biomass under weedy conditions. However, natural weed growth in field conditions is heterogeneous, resulting in high experimental error in phenotyping studies. Using crops as substitute weeds is one approach for improving the accuracy of estimation of WSA. Four upland-rice experiments were conducted using 14 diverse varieties in Benin between 2009 and 2011 to examine if the use of substitute weeds can improve estimation of WSA, and help identify varieties with strong WSA. Two rice varieties (Aus 257, which was also included in 14 varieties tested, and IR 1552, a purple-leaved rice) and cowpea (cv. KVx396-18) were tested as substitute weeds, and compared with natural weed infestation. At 50-62 days after rice sowing, weed biomass (weeds, rice or cowpea) were measured as an indicator of WSA. While WSA was more heritable in plots with substitute weeds than with natural weed infestation, there was no large difference in heritability among substitute weeds. In only one of the four experiments was the effect of variety on WSA not consistent between substitute weeds and natural weeds. But in this experiment, Aus 257 consistently showed strong WSA in both plots with substitute weeds and plots with natural weed infestation. Superior WSA of Aus 257 was also observed in the other experiments, and associated with higher biomass accumulation. These results indicate that the use of substitute weeds can offer an efficient selection approach for improving weed-suppressive ability of upland rice. Aus 257 can be used as donor for developing varieties with strong weed-suppressive ability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study simulates annual net primary production (NPP) of forests over peninsular Spain during the years 2005-2012. The modeling strategy consists of a linked production efficiency model based on the Monteith approach and the bio-geochemical model Biome-BGC. Recently produced databases and data layers over the study area including meteorological daily series, ecophysiological parameters, and maps containing information about forest type, rooting depth, and growing stock volume (GSV), were employed. The models, which simulate forest processes assuming equilibrium conditions, were previously optimized for the study area. The production efficiency model was used to estimate daily gross primary production (GPP), while Biome-BGC was used to simulate growth (R-G) and maintenance (R-M) respirations. To account for actual forest conditions, GPP, R-G, and R-M were corrected using the ratio of the remotely-sensed derived actual to potential GSV as an indicator of the actual state of forests. The obtained results were evaluated against current annual increment observations from the Third Spanish Forest Inventory. Coefficients of determination ranged from 0.46 to 0.74 depending on the forest type. A simplified dataset was produced by applying regular increments in air temperature and reductions in precipitation to the original 2005-2012 daily series with the goal of covering the range of variation of the climate projections corresponding to the different climate change scenarios reported in the literature. The modified meteorological series were used to simulate new GPP, R-G, and R-M through Biome-BGC and corrected using GSV. Precipitation was confirmed as the main limiting factor in the study area. In the regions where precipitation was already a limiting factor during 2005-2012, both the increment in air temperature and the reduction in precipitation contributed to a reduction of NPP. In the regions where precipitation was not a limiting factor during 2005-2012, the increment in air temperature led to an increment of NPP. This study is therefore relevant to characterize the growth of Spanish forests both in current and expected climate conditions.

AB  - Three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) living at the southern limit of the species distribution range could possess specific morphological and physiological traits that enable these fish to live at the threshold of their physiological capacities. Morphological analysis was carried out on samples of sticklebacks living in different saline habitats of the Camargue area (Rhone delta, northern Mediterranean coast) obtained from 1993 to 2017. Salinity acclimation capacities were also investigated using individuals from freshwater-low salinity drainage canals and from mesohaline-euryhaline lagoons. Fish were maintained in laboratory conditions at salinity values close to those of their respective habitats: low salinity (LS, 5 parts per thousand) or seawater (SW, 30 parts per thousand). Fish obtained from a mesohaline brackish water lagoon (BW, 15 parts per thousand) were acclimated to SW or LS. Oxygen consumption rates and branchial Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity (indicator of fish osmoregulatory capacity) were measured in these LS or SW control fish and in individuals subjected to abrupt SW or LS transfers. At all the studied locations, only the low-plated "leiurus" morphotype showed no spatial or temporal variations in their body morphology. Gill rakers were only longer and denser in fish sampled from the LS-freshwater (FW) drainage canals. All fish presented similar physiological capacities. Oxygen consumption rates were not influenced by salinity challenge except in SW fish transferred to LS immediately and 1 h after transfer. However, and as expected, gill NKA activity was salinity dependent. Sticklebacks of the Camargue area sampled from habitats with contrasted saline conditions are homogenously euryhaline, have low oxygen consumption rates and do not appear to experience significantly greater metabolic costs when challenged with salinity. However, an observed difference in gill raker length and density is most probably related to the nutritional condition of their habitat, indicating that individuals can rapidly acclimatize to different diets.

AB  - In this study we analyzed the influence of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon on drought severity at the global scale. A unique aspect of the analysis is that the ENSO influence was quantified using a multiscalar drought indicator, which allowed assessment of the role of the ENSO phases on drought types affecting various hydrological, agricultural and environmental systems. The study was based on ENSO composites corresponding to El Nino and La Nina phases, which were obtained from the winter El Nino 3.4 index for the period 1901-2006. Drought was identified in a multiscalar way using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the global SPEIbase data set. The study revealed the differing impacts of the El Nino and La Nina phases on drought severity, the time scales of droughts, and the period of the year when the ENSO phases explained drought variability worldwide. In large areas of America and eastern Europe the role of ENSO events were evident at the shortest time scales (1-3 months) at the beginning of events, but in areas of South Africa, Australia and Southeast Asia the effects were more obvious some months later, and at longer time scales. We also identified areas where severe drought conditions are associated with more than 70% of ENSO events. The persistence of the drought signal at longer time-scales (e.g., 6- or 12-months) is not directly determined by the atmospheric circulation response to the SST anomalies, since the SPEI anomalies will be caused by the cumulative dry conditions in some specific months. Knowledge of how these effects differ as a function of the El Nino and La Nina phases, and how they propagate throughout the drought time scales could aid in the prediction of the expected drought severity associated with the ENSO. Lags detected during the study may help forecasting of dry conditions in some regions up to one year before their occurrence.

AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas with a high contribution from agricultural soils and emissions that depend on soil type, climate, crops and management practices. The N2O emissions therefore need to be included as an integral part of environmental assessments of agricultural production systems. An algorithm for N2O production and emission from agricultural soils was developed and included in the FASSET whole-farm model. The model simulated carbon and nitrogen (N) turnover on a daily basis. Both nitrification and denitrification was included in the model as sources for N2O production, and the N2O emissions depended on soil microbial and physical conditions. The model was tested on experimental data of N2O emissions from grasslands in UK, Finland and Denmark, differing in climatic conditions, soil properties and management. The model simulated the general time course of N2O emissions and captured the observed effects of fertiliser and manure management on emissions. Scenario analyses for grazed and cut grasslands were conducted to evaluate the effects of soil texture, climatic conditions, grassland management and N fertilisation on N2O emissions. The soils varied from coarse sand to sandy loam and the climatic variation was taken to represent the climatic variation within Denmark. N fertiliser rates were varied from 0 to 500 kg N ha(-1). The simulated N2O emissions showed a non-linear response to increasing N rates with increasing emission factors at higher N rates. The simulated emissions increased with increasing soil clay contents. N2O emissions were slightly increased at higher temperatures, whereas increasing annual rainfall generally lead to decreasing emissions. Emissions were slightly higher from grazed grasslands compared with cut grasslands at similar rates of total N input (fertiliser and animal excreta). The results indicate higher emission factors and thus higher potentials for reducing N2O emissions for intensively grazed grasslands on fine textured soils than for extensive cut-based grasslands on sandy soils.

AB  - In this investigation, a laboratory-scale enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) process was operated under controlled conditions to study the impact of varying the influent ratio of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total phosphorus (TP), and the consequential biochemical reactions on oxygen transfer parameters. The data showed that the experiment with high influent phosphorus relative to nitrogen (COD/TP = 51 and TKN/ TP =3.1) achieved higher alpha and oxygen transfer efficiency (OTEf). On the other hand, the experiment with high influent nitrogen relative to phosphorus (TKN/TP = 14.7 and COD/TP = 129) resulted in approximately 50% reduction in alpha and OTEf under similar organic loading. This suggested that the intracellular carbon storage and the enhanced biological P removal phenomenon associated with the phosphorus-accumulating organisms (PAOs) had a positive influence on OTEf in the high phosphorus experiment compared to an active population of nitrifying and denitrifying organisms in the high nitrogen experiment. The intracellular carbon storage by the glycogen-accumulating organisms also appeared to have had a positive effect on oxygen transfer efficiency, although to a lesser extent in comparison to the PAOs. It was also found that oxygen uptake rate (OUR) was not a good indicator of the measured alpha and OTEf, because it was a combined effect of several biochemical reactions, each having a varying degree of influence. It is difficult to underestimate the crucial role of flocs in mass transfer of oxygen, because microorganisms associated with flocs carry out the biochemical reactions. It seems that the combination of influent characteristics and biochemical reactions in each experiment produced a unique biomass quality (determined by the biomass N to P ratio), ultimately affecting the mass transfer of oxygen. A theoretical explanation for the observed oxygen transfer efficiency under the process conditions is also proposed in this article. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Gypsum and halite are the most common salts in reg soils developed on alluvial parent material under extremely arid conditions in the Negev Desert, Israel. The aim of this paper is to document the changes in the micromorphology of these salts at different stages of Reg soil development on two alluvial fan chronosequences. The micromorphological analyses included thin section observations and scanning electron microscope and electron microprobe analyses.
   In this arid soil environment, gypsum and halite possess a variety of crystal forms which may change with depth in a single profile and/or between profiles of different ages. The variety of crystal forms results from changes in the microenvironmental conditions that occur in desert reg soils over time. Poikilitic lenticular gypsum is found in all Reg soils and is distributed throughout the profiles. The conditions needed for such crystals to form are high ionic impurities and deposition in a void system where space is not limiting. Microcrystalline alabastrine gypsum is only found in mature Reg soils and is crystallized when the profile has high amounts of fine material and a well-developed desert pavement. In a well-developed Reg soil, profile indicators, such as a well-developed desert pavement and high amounts of fine earth, limit the leaching depth and cause gypsum deposition from supersaturated soil solutions under high evaporation rates close to the surface. Prismatic and fibrous gypsum are less common. Low amounts of prismatic gypsum are found in young and mature soils while fibrous gypsum is found only in mature soils in re-cemented shattered gravel.
   The halite crystal form is mainly cubic with low amounts of host material incorporated into the crystal. It occurs predominantly in mature Reg soil profiles through the crystallization from supersaturated soil solutions at the depth of maximum water penetration. Although the alabastrine, prismatic and fibrous gypsum and cubic halite are deposited in a displacive manner, no correlation was found between their occurrence and the distribution of shattered gravel in the soil profile.

AB  - n-Alkanes are widely used in paleoenvironmental reconstructions. However, our understanding of changes in the distribution of n-alkanes with climatic and environmental factors remains unclear in arid/semi-arid regions. We sampled 26 surface sediments from three climatic zones across the southwestern Tibetan Plateau to evaluate the sensitivity of chain length distributions of n-alkanes to climatic and environmental parameters. Our observations demonstrate that average chain length (ACL), proportion of aquatic macrophyte (Paq), carbon preference index (CPI) and ratio of the contents of nC(27) and nC(31) (nC(27)/nC(31)) are all sensitive to hydroclimatic conditions. In contrast to commonly-adopted assumptions, the correlations between these indices and hydrological parameters are not always good, which indicates that the interpretation of n-alkane indices is special on the southwestern Tibetan Plateau. These might be related to the vegetation characteristics and seasonality of biological activity, and need to be considered in paleoclimatic reconstruction. The impact of seasonal precipitation on n-alkanes indices was also evaluated.

AB  - Directional change in environmental drivers sometimes triggers regime shifts in ecosystems. Theory and experiments suggest that regime shifts can be detected in advance, and perhaps averted, by monitoring resilience indicators such as variance and autocorrelation of key ecosystem variables. However, it is uncertain whether management action prompted by a change in resilience indicators can prevent an impending regime shift. We caused a cyanobacterial bloom by gradually enriching an experimental lake while monitoring an unenriched reference lake and a continuously enriched reference lake. When resilience indicators exceeded preset boundaries, nutrient enrichment was stopped in the experimental lake. Concentrations of algal pigments, dissolved oxygen saturation, and pH rapidly declined following cessation of nutrient enrichment and became similar to the unenriched lake, whereas a large bloom occurred in the continuously enriched lake. This outcome suggests that resilience indicators may be useful in management to prevent unwanted regime shifts, at least in some situations. Nonetheless, a safer approach to ecosystem management would build and maintain the resilience of desirable ecosystem conditions, for example, by preventing excessive nutrient input to lakes and reservoirs.

AB  - We live in an ever changing biosphere that faces continuous and often stressing environmental challenges. From this perspective, much effort is currently devoted to understanding how natural populations succeed or fail in adapting to evolving conditions. In a different context, many complex dynamical systems experience critical transitions where their dynamical behaviour or internal structure changes suddenly. Here we connect both approaches and show that in rough and correlated fitness landscapes, population dynamics shows flickering under small stochastic environmental changes, alerting of the existence of tipping points. Our analytical and numerical results demonstrate that transitions at the genomic level preceded by early-warning signals are a generic phenomenon in constant and slowly driven landscapes affected by even slight stochasticity. As these genomic shifts are approached, the time to reach mutation-selection equilibrium dramatically increases, leading to the appearance of hysteresis in the composition of the population. Eventually, environmental changes significantly faster than the typical adaptation time may result in population extinction. Our work points out several indicators that are at reach with current technologies to anticipate these sudden and largely unavoidable transitions.

AB  - It is crucial that today's land uses are not decoupled even further from prevailing site conditions. Quite the contrary, the site-adequate use of natural resources ought to be mandatory. This is provided for to a certain extent by the concept of multifunctionality and the exploitation of locational geological potential. Nevertheless, an appropriate course of action has yet to be taken. This can be achieved by applying an appropriate geo-based land use concept. To this end, however, from the scientific perspective alone, there has to be a new level of quality in the interaction between the various specialist disciplines to resolve the nexus problem and to achieve systemic approaches. The gap between the knowledge available in geology and the aspired land use concepts appears to be particularly large. A land use concept that pursues a systemic approach and refers to an adequate extent to geological knowledge provides options for future site-adequate land use as the basis for respective decision-makers or decision-making processes, not any longer conducted by political constraints or economic incentives only.

AB  - P>Based on satellite images and historical vegetation maps, Phragmites australis (common reed) in the Liaohe Delta, in north-east China, has expanded from 78 078 ha in 1984 to 91 262 ha in 2006, averaging over 600 ha year-1. This study also attempted to elucidate the reason for this expansion, using both historical documents and field surveys. The results suggested that the expansion of P. australis was driven mainly by human activities. Freshwater irrigation reduced soil salinity; irrigation of land blocks divided by canals and ditches (square-land irrigation) maintained optimal temperature, water and oxygen for the growth of P. australis; deep freshwater irrigation and seawater irrigation eliminated some weeds; combined irrigation and burning eliminated an insect pest. These examples in the Liaohe Delta showed that water, salinity, oxygen, temperature and insect pests were important ecological factors that affected the growth of P. australis. By harmonising these ecological factors, optimal conditions were created for the natural expansion of P. australis and promoted the formation of monospecific stands of P. australis.

AB  - Metal distribution coefficients (K-D) are used in fate models and environmental impact assessment. Typically they are entered as constants, whereas variations in environmental conditions affect their magnitude. Therefore, a model that expresses K-D for suspended solids as a function of aqueous and solid phase characteristics was developed. The model estimates K-D values from easy-to-measure water quality variables and accounts for (a) surface complexation of metal species to the major phases comp rising suspended solids, (b) metal complexation by dissolved ligands, (c) competition by-major cations, and (d) electrostatic effects. Most of the model parameters were derived from the literature and fixed. A few parameters for which K-D was most sensitive were calibrated an field K-D values for stagnant waters in The Netherlands. The estimated parameters were well within the literature ranges. The model was capable of explaining 75% (Zn) and 95% (Cu) of the observed variability of K-D. We conclude that laboratory constants for surface and aqueous phase complexation are useful for predicting Zn and Cu sorption to suspended solids in natural waters.

AB  - The seasonal variations of biochemical algal parameters together with metabolic indicators and population as well as. environmental variables were examined in a eutrophic temperate lake (Lake Aydat, France). At early spring, the diatom Melosira italica subsp. subarctica developed. However, the increase in temperature and irradiance provoqued the sedimentation of Melosira as reflected by the high levels of Protein/Carbohydrate ratios and their increase with depth. During summer when nitrogen was exhausted, the cells accumulated reserve products (carbohydrates and lipids). The increase of Protein/ Carbohydrate ratio with depth and the simultaneous stability of the energy charge indicate that the cells actively switch to "active survival" when leaving the euphotic zone by choosing catabolic over anabolic pathways.
   Despite of the summer-nitrogen shortage, phytoplankton biomass was high. The use of atmospheric nitrogen by cyanobacteria, that of low concentrations of nitrates in the water not detected by our technique and the high levels of nitrate reductase activity potential were proposed to explain this paradox.

AB  - Background: Measuring metabolic parameters in the blood has been an indispensable tool for assessing the productive and health status of dairy cows for more than 100 years. The values of laboratory parameters depend on various preanalytical, analytical and postanalytical factors. The most important preanalytical factors are sample transport time and temperature, hemolysis, anticoagulant type, and sample volume. Preanalytical factors can lead to reduced stability of the analyte in the sample, which changes their concentration. Loss of stability changes the time of storage and manipulation of the sample, which determines the criteria for its acceptance or rejection. The two stability indicators are stability limit and maximum permissible instability. A stability limit (SL) is defined as the period of time in which a property variation does not exceed a maximum permissible instability (MPI). The aim of this study was to determine the SL and MPI for each analyte in the blood serum of cows and to determine whether SL differs in the function of the presence of preanalytical errors in the blood sample.
   Materials, Methods & Results: Three hundred samples of dairy cow origin in different periods of lactation participated in this research. They were classified into 6 groups of 50 samples: according to the time from sampling to processing in the laboratory (0-4 h, 4-8 h and over 8 h; all transported on dry ice, protected from environmental factors, without preanalytical errors) and according to the presence of preanalytical errors (group with hemolysis, a group transported at ambient temperature and a group with a small sample volume). Each sample was aliquoted in two portions. One portion was left at +4 degrees C and tested once a day for 6 days of sample storage, and the second portion, placed at-20 degrees C, was tested once a month for 6 months. The MPI had a value ranging from 1.51 to 8.4. Metabolic profile analytes with lower MPI values (1.51-3.22) were albumin (ALB), total protein (TPROT), UREA, glucose (GLU), calcium (Ca), and phosphorus (P). Higher MPI values (5.1-8.4) were found for nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), beta-hydroxybutirate (BHB), cholesterol (CHOL), triglycerides (TGC), total bilirubin (TBIL) and aspartat aminotransferase (AST). For most parameters, we can conclude that their PD% changed faster in storage conditions at+4 degrees C compared to the regime of-20 degrees C. The largest number of biochemical analytes in bovine blood serum shows preserved stability in the first 6 days at+4 degrees C or 6 months at-20 degrees C if transported to the laboratory within 8 h after sampling in ideal conditions and without the action of preanalytical errors. Prolonged transport under ideal conditions or the existence of preanalytical errors such as transport at room temperature, hemolysis or small sample volume shorten the stability of the ALB, NEFA, GLU, UREA and P. Concentration of all analytes decreases during the stability test except for UREA, NEFA, BHB and for CHOL and TGC in some groups. Variations in parameters such as BHB, NEFA, TBIL, AST, and Ca have shown potential clinical significance. At storage conditions at+4 degrees C, clinically significant variations at at least one measurement point were found for AST (7.5% of samples), BHB (6.1% of samples), NEFA (9.9% of samples) and for TBIL (in 7% of samples).
   Discussion: This study can help define acceptable delay times and storage conditions for bovine blood samples, which is of great importance because in working with farm animals it is often not possible to take samples in a short time and deliver them to the laboratory, and samples are often burdened with certain preanalytical errors with limited possibilities of re-sampling.

AB  - The increasing pressure on water resources in Nebraska-US and other agricultural areas requires the implementation of innovative tools and solutions for the governance of water resources and the analysis of water use efficiency. In this vein, this paper presents the application of a remote sensing based soil water balance for the study of water use in agricultural areas. The specific objectives were the identification of the temporal and spatial behavior of the irrigation water use based on the quantification of the water use deviation (irrigation water applied minus irrigation water requirements), as the main indicator and the comparative analysis of the irrigation productivity (crop yield under irrigated field minus crop yield under rainfed condition per volume of water applied by irrigation), WPi, water productivity (harvestable grain per total volume of water applied considering precipitation plus irrigation), WP, and finally water productivity based on evapotranspiration (harvested grain per total volume of water evapotranspired), WPET, in the various management zones analyzed. Additionally, we examined the impact of soil types, local weather and irrigation system (center pivot and furrow irrigation) on these indicators. The study was carried out in three Natural Resources District (Tri-Basin, Central Platte and Lower Niobrara) across Central Nebraska for the period 2004-2012 and comprised over 2000 irrigated corn fields per year. Crop water requirements were estimated using the reflectance-based crop coefficient approach developed in previous research (see Campos et al., 2017) and the field data were reported for each field monitored through cropland data layer by National Agricultural Statistics Service of USDA. The difference between modeled irrigation water requirements and field level irrigation application was significant (p < 0.001) being the water use deviation in generally positive (over irrigation). These results were consistently higher for furrow irrigated fields during the whole analyzed period, reaching up to three times more water applied compared to the required amount. This was expected as surface irrigation systems typically require a higher application depth. This trend changed for the central pivot irrigated fields depending on the climatic conditions, especially in dry years. The analysis of the water use deviation with respect to soil types and weather conditions revealed that the water use deviation is not justified by the biophysical conditions alone. The estimated values of WP and WPi for furrow system was lower compared to center pivot in both NRD's reaching the maximum value of 1.37 kg m(-3) and 3.06 kg m(-3) for WP and WPi in Tri-basin respectively for center pivot. In general, the results suggested potential to improve water management in these NRDs in Central Nebraska and reduce pumping potentially saving groundwater resources for drought years and other uses monitoring soil type, weather data and switching to sprinklers system.

AB  - The average chain length (ACL), carbon preference index (CPI), and hydrogen isotope composition (delta H-2) of long-chain n-alkanes in sediments have been used to retrieve information about the paleoclimate. Despite their importance as in-between media from leaves to sediments, n-alkanes of surface soils have not been systematically analyzed at large scale. Such an investigation of the spatial variation of n-alkane properties in soil and their dependence on climatic and botanic (e.g., vegetation type) factors could provide a rationale for a better estimation of the past environment. We synthesized the patterns and delta H-2 of long-chain n-alkanes in soil (delta H-2(n-alkanes)) with regard to vegetation types (cropland, grassland, shrubland, and woodland) and environmental factors using data from peer-reviewed papers. Our results showed that the ACL and CPI of soil C-27-C-33 n-alkanes were not suitable indicators for differentiating vegetation types at large scale; instead, ACL significantly correlated with water conditions such as mean annual precipitation (MAP) and Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), and CPI significantly correlated with temperature without significant influence of vegetation type. The variation (i.e., standard deviation) of fractionation between the delta H-2 values in annual precipitation and in soil n-alkanes (epsilon(rain-soil)) was smaller than that reported in leaves; therefore, soils were better suited to quantifying the general growing conditions of plants at a certain site. The fractionation epsilon(rain-soil) correlated with climatic conditions as described by the PDSI and relative humidity (RH). This correlation agreed with the change in leaf water enrichment with changing RH taken from the literature and was independent of the vegetation type at large scale. This meta-analysis may provide useful information for the variations of the patterns and delta H-2(n-alkanes) values in surface soils.

AB  - -Communities of soil animals (meso- and macrofauna) in rice paddies tend to be fragmented, and have extremely low abundance. Nevertheless, some groups, such as enchytraeids, may become dominant in flooded conditions, as shown in tropical rice agroecosystems. However, the fauna and functional composition of enchytraeids (Annelida, Clitellata, Enchytraeidae) under such conditions have not yet been studied at temperate latitudes. We have investigated enchytraeid communities and the ratio of their functional groups in the main rice-growing regions of Russia: Krasnodar krai, Primorsky krai, and the Republic of Kalmykia. Samples were taken in summer-early autumn of 2016 in four habitat types: flooded rice paddies, drained paddies occupied by upland crops, adjacent bunds, and undisturbed grasslands (control). Generalized linear model analysis showed that the factor habitat type and its interaction with the factor region had a significant effect on the total enchytraeid abundance, with the factor region alone having no such effect. Their abundance was the highest in the control habitats and bunds (mean and standard error for all the regions: 3278 +/- 1131 and 3255 +/- 762 ind./m(2), respectively), being insignificantly lower in the paddies under upland crops (1282 +/- 850 ind./m(2)) and decreasing to a minimum of 415 +/- 323 ind./m(2) in the flooded paddies. A comparison between the last two habitat types shows that enchytraeids can relatively quickly restore their abundance in the rice paddies after draining. Principal component analysis revealed a positive correlation between the density of enchytraeids belonging to basophilous ecological group and bioavailable phosphorus content. The correlation between the abundance of acidophilous enchytraeids and this parameter was negative. Thus, the abundance ratio of enchytraeid ecological groups could be used as an informative indicator of the concentrations of nutrient elements and depends on physical and chemical characteristics of paddy soils. Despite the low abundance of enchytraeids in these soils, they can be an important component of the detrital food webs during periods of paddy-drainage in intensive rice agroecosystems at temperate latitudes.

AB  - As part of the Sustainable Development Goals, countries are striving to achieve by 2030 a land degradation neutral world. Land degradation neutrality (LDN) is the state whereby the amount and quality of land resources remains stable or increases within specified temporal and spatial scales. Achieving this will require the uptake of sustainable land management (SLM) practices to increase the sustainable provision of ecosystem goods and services the human population will require. It will also require the development of systematic, robust, and validated methods for tracking progress at project, subnational and national scales. However, to date, no systematic comparison between the SLM practices and the indicators proposed for monitoring LDN has been performed. In this article, we used the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification primary recommended global sustainable land management database of World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT), and an innovative tool designed to assess and monitor land condition via changes in land productivity, Trends.Earth, to evaluate the agreement between self-reported sustainable land management technologies and indicators derived from satellite-based earth observations. We found that a combination of two primary productivity indicators derived from annual integrals of normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI), trajectory and state, were able to identify increases in primary productivity in the locations where the SLM practices are implemented in comparison to control sites where SLM practices are not known to have occurred. Moreover, different SLM practices showed unique responses in terms of proportional area which experienced increase, decrease, or remained stable terms of primary productivity. We also found that the time since establishment of the SLM technology was critical for identifying improvements in the SLM sites, as only technologies with more than 10 years since implementation show statistically significant improvements. Our results show that satellite-derived land productivity indicators are successful at detecting the impacts of SLM practices on primary productivity, positioning them as essential elements of the monitoring and assessment tools needed to track land condition to assure the achievement of a land degradation neutral world.

AB  - Background and objectives: In pediatric chronic health conditions, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is a useful indicator of health, development, and well-being. The purpose of the study was to assess the effect of clinical and environmental factors on the HRQOL of children and adolescents with spina bifida (SB). Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study of the sample of 99 children and adolescents with SB aged 5 to 17 years. The questionnaires used in the study were the Spina Bifida Health-Related Quality of Life instrument (HRQOL-SB), and the Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth. Medical data were obtained from the medical records and the clinical examination. Results: A multivariate linear regression revealed that the most potent predictors of the HRQOL in children with SB were the community overall environmental supports (beta = 0.504; p = 0.0001), a number of health conditions (beta = -0.395; p = 0.0001), access to personal transportation (beta = 0.236; p = 0.023), and supplies (beta = 0.181; p = 0.031), explaining 80.3% of the variance in the SB-HRQOL scores. The most significant predictors of the HRQOL in adolescents were a number of health conditions (beta = -0.387; p = 0.0001), cognitive demands of activities at home (beta = 0.345; p = 0.0001), supplies (beta = 0.267; p = 0.0001), money (beta = 0.303; p = 0.0001), physical layout at school (beta = 0.188; p = 0.008), and access to public transportation (beta = 0.206; p = 0.019), explaining 89.5% of the variance in the SB-HRQOL scores. Conclusions: Both clinical and environmental factors determined the HRQOL of children and adolescents with SB. Environmental supports and resources contributed to HRQOL more than medical problems, especially in adolescents. The number of associated medical problems, reflecting disease severity, was the more potent clinical predictor compared to an individual health problem.

AB  - We conducted a study of the peculiarities of the motor activity of juvenile and adult individuals of Daphnia magna in the process of thermal selection. On the example of Daphnia, we experimentally proved the assumption that the decrease in the motor activity of the ectotherms in the selected temperature range is a behaviour mechanism typical for thermal selection. The experiment was conducted on the offspring of one parthenogenetic female (pure line) of a laboratory culture maintained over several years at room temperature. The Daphnia individuals had been beforehand acclimated over several generations to 23.4 degrees C, and then were placed in a thermogradient apparatus. The control individuals were maintained at room temperature. The final temperature preference was determined using the so-called "chronic" method, when the tested organisms are maintained in a thermogradient apparatus over several days. The positions of the Daphnia individuals were recorded daily during 24 days. As a parameter which would characterize the motor activity of Daphnia, we used the parameter of average relative shifting, which was calculated as a difference (in cm) between the position they were found in two sequential records, divided by time (in min) between these records. Over the first 3 days, in the conditions of the temperature gradient, the Daphnia mostly selected heightened temperatures (24-28 degrees C). During the period from the 4th to 24th day, 74% of the Daphnia selected the range of 1823 degrees C and 85% -17-24 degrees C. Thus, the range of the ultimate selected temperatures decreased by 4 degrees C compared to the initially selected temperatures and enlarged by 3 degrees C towards the lower temperatures. In the thermogradient apparatus, the parthenogenetic females had the lowest value of the mean relative movement. In the control, at room temperature, this parameter of the adults was by 43% higher compared to the gradient. The pattern of the dynamic of the indicator in both variants of the experiment was similar for the periods and phases of fluctuations. With the juveniles the value of the parameter of mean relative shifting in the gradient was higher by 40% compared to the adult Daphnia, but close to the parameter of the adults in the control. We determined a relationship between the juveniles selecting the higher temperatures and higher mean relative shifting, which indicates a relationship between the behavioural selective reaction of juvenile Daphnia and general physiological condition of their organism. During the absence of the temperature gradient, the Daphnia were observed to show symmetry in their motor reaction. Occurrence of the asymmetry of the motor reaction of the Daphnia in the condition of the thermogradient, manifesting in the prevalence of shifting to lower or higher temperatures, can indicate more clearly manifested search reaction in the condition of a non-uniform environment.

AB  - The total rare earth elements (Sigma REE) abundance along with major and a range of trace element chemistry of twenty-eight sub-sections in a 5 m long sediment core (AAS-05/GC-02) from the Central Indian Ocean Basin shows a distinct REE fractionation. Sediments from the top similar to 1 m of the core have comparatively low Sigma REE abundance (close to average shale), with a sample/shale REE ratio very close to 1 strongly suggesting a dominantly terrigenous source. The down-core Sigma REE abundance shows a nearly two fold increase (Sigma REE=167-341 ppm) with depth and the REE strongly co-varies with Mn, Ti, P and smectite. Inter-element correlations and the shale-normalized REE patterns suggest that light, middle and heavy REE are selectively carried by terrigenous, Mn oxide and authigenic phosphate phases respectively suggesting a distinct REE fractionation. These fractionation effects become more pronounced with increasing depth in the core.
   The Cerium (Ce)-anomaly in marine sediments is used as one of the promising tools to trace paleo bottom water redox conditions and this varies in the sediments from 0.10 to -0.08. The Ce-anomaly in general is positive in the top 4 m but the top similar to 1 m have higher Ce-anomaly, Mn/Ti and Ce/Ti suggest sediment deposition relatively under more oxic bottom water condition. The negative Ce-anomaly between 4 and 5 m depth, which could be interpreted to indicate a suboxic/anoxic environment. The redox environment inferred by the Ce-anomaly is compared to a number of other redox sensitive parameters to test its reliability. These include Mn content, total organic carbon, U/Th, authigenic Uranium, Cu/Zn and V/Cr ratio that all suggestive of deposition of sediments under oxygenated bottom water condition. Thus, the negative Ce-anomaly observed between 4 and 5 m core depth does not represent a suboxic/anoxic environment, but is more likely due to the retention of a negative Ce-anomaly caused by authigenic phosphate and authigenic Fe-rich smectite which is formed by the reaction between iron oxyhydroxide and biogenic opal suggests an early diagenetic process and is in equilibrium with seawater REE. Early diagenetic process is responsible for the part of negative Ce-anomaly observed here. Therefore, we suggest that the Ce-anomaly of bulk sediments as an indicator of paleo-ocean bottom water redox conditions needs to be used with a caution. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are related to plant community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. Overgrazing can negatively affect plant performance, and consequently unbalance the association with AMF. We studied the grazing effect on AMF colonization for preferred (Bromus pictus and Poa ligularis) and unpreferred grasses (Pappostipa speciosa and Pappostipa humilis) by sheep in the Patagonian steppe. For each species, AMF colonization in ungrazed, moderate and intense grazing sites was quantified. In ungrazed areas, B. pictus showed the highest extent of AMF colonization. Mycorrhizal colonization was higher during the active season, and largely reduced by intense grazing conditions. The decrease of AMF colonization was maximal for the most preferred species, but also significant for the unpreferred species. Our results suggest that overgrazing could reduce mycorrhizal benefits for the plant by reduction of AMF colonization, which can be a good indicator of ecosystem functioning, eventually revealing an increasing degree of environmental degradation.

AB  - The epiphytic vascular mycobiota is scarce and facultative in semi-arid Mediterranean ecosystems. However, unlike in soil conditions, little is known about the factors driving mycorrhizal communities in epiphytic environments. Here, we investigated the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) harboured by 31 plant species occurring on the trunks of Phoenix dactylifera. We wanted to ascertain if host identity and plant functional traits shape mycorrhizal communities. Specifically, we tested the plant life-cycle (perennial versus annual), the plant life-form (herbaceous versus woody), the plant origin (exotic versus native) and the plant species. The plant affiliation to species strongly influenced the AMF community composition. Plant life-form and plant life-cycle also shaped indicator taxa. The AMF structure differed between annual and perennial species and higher AMF richness was detected in perennial plants. The epiphytic plants associated with AMF irrespective of whether they were native or not, probably because here no functional differences derive from plant origin.

AB  - Herons comprise a distinctive family of birds, the Ardeidae, adapted to living in aquatic environments. The history of herons in human culture dates back at least 4,000 years. continuing through successive cultures. Through the millennia, hunting herons for sport, food, or feathers has been one of the more enduring conservation issues for the group. Killing egrets for their feathers initiated the modern conservation era in the United States and Europe. Overall, protection of nesting sites and feeding habitats has been, and remains, a significant theme in heron conservation. Owing to their longevity, wetland dependence, and site specificity, herons have been proposed as potential indicators of environmental conditions and trends. It has been recognized that landscape and regional conservation action is the most effective conservation tool for most species, but several species and populations have been identified as being at risk and requiring special species- and population-level planning and action. To facilitate the conservation of herons, HeronConservation, the Heron Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, was founded in 1982 and has since led global engagement in heron conservation through communication, networking, technical syntheses, and action planning and facilitation.

AB  - The current study analyzed the diversity of vascular flora in relation to the prevailing environmental gradients of Ayubia National Park (ANP) of 33.2km(2) area. The phyto-environmental conditions of ANP were analyzed by multivariate techniques. The data analysis was based on indicator species concept and only presence data were used to classify and ordinate species distribution. The hierarchical clustering by an agglomerative method and ordination by Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) identified major plant communities in the Park. The study revealed that some environmental factors have a determining role in defining and shaping the key vegetation classes and species richness in the area. NMDS-Ordination indicated elevation (Pr>0.001) as highly significant environmental gradient followed by stream power index (Pr>0.012) and slope length factor (Pr>0.025) in plant species distribution. The study recommends important phyto sociological parameters for species distribution that may facilitate conservation of biodiversity and developing future strategies for mountain ecosystems.

AB  - Ants are highly influential organisms in terrestrial ecosystems, including the tallgrass prairie, one of the most endangered ecosystems in North America. Through their tunneling, ants affect soil properties and resource availability for animals and plants. Ants also have important ecological roles as consumers of plant tissue and seeds. In the last several decades, various organizations, agencies, and agricultural producers have attempted to create wildlife habitat or reduce soil erosion by seeding thousands of hectares of bare cropland in the central United States with tallgrass prairie seed mixes. Although initially, monitoring of these restorations and of unplowed prairie remnants focused on plants and birds, in recent years the response of invertebrates such as ants has increasingly been the subject of research. An understanding of tallgrass prairie ant communities can help land managers and scientists better monitor the ecological condition of tallgrass prairie and guide management and restoration efforts. Here I review our current knowledge of ant species found within tallgrass prairie, their ecological roles, and their response to management.

AB  - The aim of our studies was to assess the pollution resulting from burning fossil fuels and their emission lines (expressways). Quantitative and qualitative analysis of inorganic and organic pollutants, including PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) adsorbed on the surfaces, or formed through thermal decomposition of used biomarkers, was based on coupled techniques such as ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma with mass spectrometry), GC-MS (gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy), and TG-FTIR (thermogravimetry coupled with Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy).
   In terms of urban areas and highways, sources of inorganic and organic pollutants are motor vehicles. Studies based on the use of the measuring apparatus do not give information on the impacts on living organisms of the pollutants such as heavy metals or PAH. Observation creates the possibility of such bioindicators. Qualitative and quantitative bioindicators exposed to environmental toxins can identify the natural environmental conditions because organisms having characteristics of bioindicators respond to changes in the biotope. They have high sensitivity to toxic substances or high degrees of tolerance against entering toxins. Bio vesicular Pleurozium schreberi (Willd.) Mitten is commonly used.

AB  - Milk is a very important part of our diet, which is why there is a wide variety of packaging alternatives with considerable local variants on the market. This study assesses the environmental impact of the commonest packaging options on the Spanish market and evaluates (from the point of view of global warming and acidification) the production of the various packaging materials and sizes and their final disposal (landfilling, incineration and recycling). For the two indicators studied (global warming and acidification) larger aseptic carton packages and recycling disposal have the best environmental impact.
   The global warming and acidification potential of the milk life cycle were also studied: milk production, transport (local conditions), packaging production and packaging disposal. Of the two indicators studied, the milk production stage has the largest impact on the milk life cycle. It should be taken into account that the impact of the milk production stage can vary considerably and has a significant influence on the global warming and acidification potential of the milk life cycle.

AB  - Multi-model ensemble simulations using three coupled physical-biogeochemical models were performed to calculate the combined impact of projected future climate change and plausible nutrient load changes on biogeochemical cycles in the Baltic Sea. Climate projections for 1961-2099 were combined with four nutrient load scenarios ranging from a pessimistic business-as-usual to a more optimistic case following the Helsinki Commission's (HELCOM) Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP). The model results suggest that in a future climate, water quality, characterized by ecological quality indicators like winter nutrient, summer bottom oxygen, and annual mean phytoplankton concentrations as well as annual mean Secchi depth (water transparency), will be deteriorated compared to present conditions. In case of nutrient load reductions required by the BSAP, water quality is only slightly improved. Based on the analysis of biogeochemical fluxes, we find that in warmer and more anoxic waters, internal feedbacks could be reinforced. Increased phosphorus fluxes out of the sediments, reduced denitrification efficiency and increased nitrogen fixation may partly counteract nutrient load abatement strategies.

AB  - As habitats change, species with higher intraspecific variation have more resources to adapt. Medicinal plants in the Himalayas are increasingly threatened by climate change and other anthropogenic influences. The intraspecific variation within and among 17 populations of the high-elevation herb Trillium govanianum Wall. ex D.Don was studied as an indicator of adaptability. The variation in 19 traits of population structure, morphology, and phytochemistry was assessed across habitats that varied in elevation (2452-3432 m a.s.l.), aspect, latitude (30.1-31.7 degrees N), and arboreal community. The morphology and population structure were conserved among populations but varied among regions. The populations in the lower elevation mixed forests of Tirthan Valley produced smaller rhizomes but larger plant densities, such that plant biomass per square metre was conserved. The phytochemistry varied among regions and populations within regions, indicating significant variation among habitats. The aboveground morphology of the species masks considerable variations in belowground morphology and phytochemistry. The observed variations can help the species to adapt to the changing environmental conditions by provoking a functional response.

AB  - Hydrological indicators support analyses about the impact of climate and anthropogenic changes on riverine ecosystems. As these studies often rely on hydrological models for estimating the future value of the indicators, it is important to investigate how well, and under which conditions, we can replicate changes in the indicators. This study looks at these questions by investigating the performance that can be achieved depending on the objective function for calibrating the model, the direction of the change in the indicator, the magnitude of this change and the properties of the catchments. The results indicate that, in general, indicators describing the magnitude of discharge (monthly and annual) can be adequately estimated with hydrological models, but that there are difficulties when estimating the characteristics of flow pulses, flow reversals and timing variables. For some of these indicators, it is not even possible to correctly estimate the direction of large changes. The analysis showed further that these problems cannot be resolved by adjusting the calibrated parameters, but that the model structure is unsuitable for modelling these indicators.

AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) is an important indicator of ecosystem health and its estimation and understanding of factors determining its spatial and temporal variations is critical. It is important to note that biophysical factors and human induced factors are interlinked in determining NPP patterns. Nevertheless, it is difficult to consider some aspects of human management systems in relation to NPP variations on a global scale analysis than on a local scale analysis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that, at the local scale, particularly in highly intensive systems, land-use/land tenure types influence NPP variations by altering the biophysical conditions of the land. We estimated NPP between 2000 and 2009 using MODIS data and used ANOVA to test the abovementioned hypotheses. Results showed that NPP significantly (p<0.05) varied by land-use/land tenure type. We also found that biophysical factors remained essential in explaining NPP variations even at local scales. These results exhibit the intricacies that exist between the biophysical and human-induced factors in explaining NPP variations within ecological landscapes.

AB  - Living whole-cell bioreporters serve as environmental biosentinels that survey their ecosystems for harmful pollutants and chemical toxicants, and in the process act as human and other higher animal proxies to pre-alert for unfavorable, damaging, or toxic conditions. Endowed with bioluminescent, fluorescent, or colorimetric signaling elements, bioreporters can provide a fast, easily measured link to chemical contaminant presence, bioavailability, and toxicity relative to a living system. Though well tested in the confines of the laboratory, real-world applications of bioreporters are limited. In this review, we will consider bioreporter technologies that have evolved from the laboratory towards true environmental applications, and discuss their merits as well as crucial advancements that still require adoption for more widespread utilization. Although the vast majority of environmental monitoring strategies rely upon bioreporters constructed from bacteria, we will also examine environmental biosensing through the use of less conventional eukaryotic-based bioreporters, whose chemical signaling capacity facilitates a more human-relevant link to toxicity and health-related consequences.

AB  - Planning and constructing tunnels in urban or ecologically sensitive areas require an environmentally friendly approach. However, it is quite difficult to characterize, assess, and predict the environmental consequences of tunneling, especially in carbonate mountain areas. It is found that there is an Epi-Fissure-Karst-Zone (EFKZ) in Laoshan carbonate mountain, which is situated in middle China. EFKZ is a zone intensively fractured, weathered, karstified; it is thereby permeable and of a vital ecological significance. Monitoring results in boreholes indicate that tunneling has the potential to cause noticeable drawdown of groundwater level in the EFKZ, which means a decrease of groundwater retention capacity. Based on monitoring results and comprehensive analysis, this paper studies the influencing factors of tunnel construction on the groundwater in the EFKZ as a first-step research, and then puts forward a TEIF parametric methodology for assessment of potential impacts of tunneling on groundwater in the EFKZ and ecological conditions. Applying the TEIF parametric method, a risk assessment of environmental impact of tunneling has been made for Laoshan Tunnel.

AB  - Ecological agriculture (eco-agriculture) is an approach to agriculture that seeks a balance between ecological and economic benefits to promote the sustainable development of both. This paper proposes a scientific method for analyzing the environmental and economic effects of eco-agriculture and simulating their long-term trend. Here, we focus on the eco-agriculture system of Kongtong District, Pingliang City, Gansu Province, China, and we build a system dynamics model named "AEP-SD" to evaluate the integrated effects of the system from 2009 to 2050. Under business as usual conditions, simulation results show rapid improvement until a peak is reached in 2027, after which the system will decline gradually. The model identifies some defects and disadvantages of the current agriculture system, such as the excessive increase of cattle slaughter, unstable production of methane, slow development of organic agriculture, and unsustainable energy structure. System improvement policies are offered and then proven by the model that they can indeed reduce the negative effects and eliminate the potential risks of system decline. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A 1-year cycle of observations was performed in four Sicilian transitional water systems (Oliveri-Tindari, Cape Peloro, Vendicari and Marsala) to characterise their ecological status. A panel of variables among which trophic and microbial (enzyme activities, abundance of hetetrophic bacteria and of bacterial pollution indicators) parameters, were selected. Particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PON) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) contents defined the trophic state, while microbial hydrolysis rates and abundance gave insights on microbial community efficiency in organic matter transformation and on allochthonous inputs. To classify the trophic state of examined waters, the synthetic trophic state index (TRIX) was calculated. Microbial hydrolysis rates correlated positively with POC and Chl-a, which increased along the eutrophication gradient. The significant relationships among TRIX, trophic and microbial parameters suggested the use of leucine aminopeptidase, alkaline phosphatase and POC as suitable parameters to implement the Water Framework Directive when assessing the ecological status of transitional water systems.

AB  - In recent deliberations on the quality of life, the air quality that man breathes plays a significant role. It is beyond dispute that since 1990, Poland has been a period of making up for many years of neglect of the natural environment. The study aimed to check whether the measures taken to reduce pollutants' emissions into the atmosphere were effective and to what extent it was possible to improve its condition and improve the environmental quality of life of Polish society in this area. The index of emission of the main air pollutants was used (this group includes: sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon oxide and dioxide, non-metallic volatile organic compounds, ammonia and particulates) to achieve the assumed objective. Using the statistical data available in the yearbooks Environment, an analysis of these compounds' emissions was carried out. The study used the descriptive, statistical and analytical method. The analysis showed that over the period analysed, emissions of the main air pollutants had decreased significantly in most cases, which has undoubtedly contributed to improving the environmental quality of life.

AB  - During transportation and storage, coal produces a lot of dust, which pollutes the environment and threatens the occupational health of workers. Although many dust suppressants have been developed for dust prevention at work, the implementation of current dust suppressants does not meet the requirements due to various factors such as the hydrophobic nature of coal dust and a harsh external environment. In this study, hydroxyethyl cellulose, acrylamide, and stearyl methyl acrylate were used for micelle polymerization to prepare an environmental protection dust suppressant for preventing dust during coal storage and transportation. The microstructure of the reactants and the products was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared as well as scanning electron microscopy. The strength and self-healing tensile properties of binder coal were taken as indicators to determine the best synthesis dosage and conditions. The dust suppressant particles are applied to the dust accumulation area, contact each other after water absorption, and swell to complete the healing, to achieve the purpose of dust control. The evaluation of the relevant properties of the dust suppressant reveals that the dust suppressant has a good covering effect, an excellent dust suppressant performance, and a significant dust suppression action.

AB  - Although the Water Framework Directive specifies that macrophytes and phytobenthos should be used for the ecological assessment of lakes and rivers, practice varies widely throughout the EU. Most countries have separate methods for macrophytes and phytobenthos in rivers; however, the situation is very different for lakes. Here, 16 countries do not have dedicated phytobenthos methods, some include filamentous algae within macrophyte survey methods whilst others use diatoms as proxies for phytobenthos. The most widely-cited justification for not having a dedicated phytobenthos method is redundancy, i.e. that macrophyte and phytoplankton assessments alone are sufficient to detect nutrient impacts. Evidence from those European Union Member States that have dedicated phytobenthos methods supports this for high level overviews of lake condition and classification; however, there are a number of situations where phytobenthos may contribute valuable information for the management of lakes.

AB  - Through a critical review and systematic analysis of pavement life cycle assessment (LCA) studies published over the past two decades, this study shows that the available information regarding the environmental impacts of pavement infrastructure is not sufficient to determine what pavement type is more environmentally sustainable. Limitations and uncertainties related to data, system boundary and functional unit definitions, consideration of use and maintenance phase impacts, are identified as the main reasons for inconsistency of reported results in pavement LCA studies. The study outcomes also highlight the need for advancement of knowledge pertaining to: (1) utilization of performance-adjusted functional units, (2) accurate estimation of use, maintenance, and end-of-life impacts, (3) incorporation of the dynamic and uncertain nature of pavement condition performance in impact assessment; (4) development of region-specific inventory data for impact estimation; and (5) consideration of a standard set of impact categories for comparison of environmental performance of different pavement types. Advancing the knowledge in these areas is critical in providing consistent and reliable results to inform decision making toward more sustainable roadway infrastructure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Global nitrogen cycling is mainly mediated by the activity of microorganisms. Nitrogen cycle processes are mediated by functional groups of microorganisms that are affected by constantly changing environmental conditions and substrate availability. In this study, we investigated the temporal and spatial patterns of nitrifier and denitrifier communities in an intertidal wetland. Soil samples were collected over four distinct seasons from three locations with different vegetative cover. Multiple environmental factors and process rates were measured and analyzed together with the community size and composition profiles. We observed that the community size and composition of the nitrifiers and denitrifiers are affected significantly by seasonal factors, while vegetative cover affected the community composition. The seasonal impacts on the community size of ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) are much higher than that of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB). The seasonal change was a more important indicator for AOA community composition patterns, while vegetation was more important for the AOB community patterns. The microbial process rates were correlated with both the community size and composition.

AB  - Water is one of the most scarcely available natural resource on earth. Its effective utilisation is a major concern felt worldwide. Water crisis is a situation felt in every sector using it (domestic, power, industry and irrigation). Exploitation of water resources in an unplanned manner has resulted in deterioration of environmental and social conditions and has resulted in an alarming situation. The Samrat Ashok Sagar Major Irrigation Scheme of the Madhya Pradesh Water Resources Department, India, was selected as a study area for the benchmarking of irrigation performance assessment by the Water Users Associations for the years 2003-2004 to 2007-2008. The Indian National Committee for Irrigation and Drainage (ICID) and the Water Resources Department, Maharashtra, India, recommended selected indicators for benchmarking of the irrigation and drainage sector. The objective of this study was to implement internal benchmarking to improve the performance of the system by creating competition between water users associations working in a major irrigation scheme.

AB  - Characterisation of organic matter composition of fossil lake sediments is important in reconstruction of fossil ecosystems and paleoclimates. High time-resolved organic matter analysis is needed to characterize sediments from small lake environments, due to their rapidly changing environmental conditions, A suitable technique for rapid analysis of organic matter in such sediments is Rock Eval pyrolysis. In small lakes, however, routine interpretation of Rock Eval data can be misleading. Lack of tributaries capable of transporting larger woody fragments into small lakes causes a bias towards the input of lipid-rich leaf waxes and cuticles. This hydrogen-rich and oxygen-depleted terrigenous organic matter (HI=250-600 [mg HC/g TOC] and OI=20-40 [mg CO2/g TOC]) can easily be misinterpreted as being of algal origin. Differentiation of terrigerrous plant-derived hydrogen-rich organic matter from algal organic matter is readily achieved by including C/N-elemental ratios and lipid biomarker data.

AB  - Here we tested the application of a nodal analysis for the elaboration of biotic indices for particular stressing conditions. The work was carried out in an intermittent Mediterranean stream where superficial flow was absent during summer. The river was perturbed by an effluent with high pH, sulphates, nitrates and conductivity. "Summer" and "winter" samples were treated separately. We first identified groups of sites differing in taxonomical composition by cluster analysis. Then we tested whether groups of sites also differed in their abiotic characteristics. In the following step, groups of cooccurring taxa were also identified by cluster analysis. The indicator value of a taxa group was measured by fidelity measurements for site groups. Indicator taxa were incorporated in a water quality table. The biotic index in the water quality table clearly discriminated impacted from reference sites in the two following years and was correlated with the first axis of a correspondence analysis biplot which also discriminated impacted from clean sites. We suggest that nodal analysis can be a reliable technique for the identification of bioindicators and the elaboration of biotic indices. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Developmental instability is an early indicator of stress, and has been used to monitor the impacts of human disturbance on natural ecosystems. Here we investigate the use of different measures of developmental instability on two species, green peppers (Capsicum annuum), a plant, and Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica), an animal. For green peppers we compared the variance in allometric relationship between control plants, and a treatment group infected with the tomato spotted wilt virus. The results show that infected plants have a greater variance about the allometric regression line than the control plants. We also observed a reduction in complexity of branch structure in green pepper with a viral infection. Box-counting fractal dimension of branch architecture declined under stress infection. We also tested the reduction in complexity of behavioral patterns under stress situations in Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica). Fractal dimension of head-lift frequency distribution measures predator detection efficiency. This dimension decreased under stressful conditions, such as advanced pregnancy and parasitic infection. Feeding distribution activities reflect food searching efficiency. Power spectral analysis proves to be the most powerful tool for characterizing fractal behavior, revealing a reduction in complexity of time distribution activity under parasitic infection.

AB  - The annual fishery of the Indian Oil Sardine (IOS), Sardinella longiceps, seems to be influenced by the ambient conditions prevailing in the habitats during their early life-history. The present study is aimed at understanding the putative behaviour of IOS along the southwest coast of India (SWCI) to monsoonal upwelling which triggers surface productivity. Mixed layer temperature is observed to be an indicator of the habitat choice and reproductive performance of IOS. A Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) model was envisioned to explain the interannual variability of the IOS fishery. In this model, the coactions of variables such as standardized catch per unit effort (SCPUE) of IOS in the first quarter (January to March), southwest monsoonal upwelling index (SWM-UI), and pre-monsoonal mixed layer temperature (PM-MLT) over three decades from 1985 to 2016 were looked upon as indicators to explain the interannual fluctuations in the fishery. Eight different criteria for eight ranks were assigned using reference values for variables. The model ranks the years based on the respective conditions defined based on the suitability criteria for IOS. The model showed a strong relationship of the variables on the annual IOS fishery and revealed that the higher first quarter SCPUE (>3.678) and SWM-UI (>758.7 kg/m/s) influences the interannual variability of the fishery significantly. The primary causative factor for the collapse of this fishery during 1992-99 was the frequent occurrence or co-occurrence of extreme climatic events such as El Nino, La Nina and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Further, a significant increase (p < 0.05) in IOS fishery was observed during 2000-07 due to favourable upwelling conditions along the SWCI. The uncertainties prevailing in a complex tropical ecosystem and associated challenges in resolving a multi-craft-gear fishery were addressed using statistical tools to infer logical explanation on the decline and revival of IOS.

AB  - The thawing and freezing conditions on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) are considered effective indicators that are widely used in ecology, climate change, cold-region engineering design, and permafrost mapping. The purpose of this study is to utilize reanalysis to detect spatial variations in freeze-thaw conditions across the QTP from 1981-2017. From a comparison of five recent reanalysis models (MERRA2: National Aeronautics and Space Administration Modern-Era Reanalysis for Research and Applications, Version 2; ERA: European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim Reanalysis; GLDAS: Global Land Data Assimilation System NOAH; CFS: National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System Reanalysis, Version 2; and CMFD: China Meteorological Forcing Dataset) against existing sparse observations of 2-m surface air temperature (SAT), we find that NASA MERRA2 dataset is the most applicable to the QTP. Then, the MERRA2 SAT dataset was selected for this study and was corrected and validated by utilizing calibration models built from the observed data. The results revealed that the correlation coefficients between the corrected MERRA2 SAT and meteorological station observed data increased from 0.52 to 0.93, 0.49 to 0.90, 0.56 to 0.93, and 0.69 to 0.93 in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, respectively. The corrected parameters performed better in the southern and southeastern portions of the QTP. Finally, we utilize the corrected MERRA2 dataset to develop freeze-thaw indices and evaluate statistical trends. We find that relatively high air freezing indices are one of the important factors for the presence of permafrost in the central and northeastern portions of the QTP. Trends in the air thawing and freezing indices in the permafrost and seasonally frozen ground regions indicate that, from 1981 to 2017 in the permafrost regions, the warming was more significant in the summer than in the other seasons. However, the winter warming rates in permafrost and seasonally frozen ground regions are almost the same.

AB  - In identifying sites of geoheritage significance, commonly there has been an emphasis on the larger-scale features. However, the story of geology and the significant features that are critical to unravel geological processes and geological history are commonly small in scale. This contribution focuses on bubble sand and bubble-sand structures as features that are small-scale but nonetheless important to geology, and hence are of geoheritage significance. Bubble sand and bubble-sand structures are ubiquitous on modern beaches and tidal flats, occurring in the uppermost tidal zone of sandy beaches, as a distinct layer in a shoaling beach-to-dune stratigraphy, and are a diagnostic indicator of upper-tidal conditions where a rising tide and a concomitantly rising water-table interacts with the upper swash-zone wave processes. On sandy tidal flats, bubble sand and bubble-sand structures may occur in the mid- to upper-tidal zones; here they are also diagnostic indicators of tidal conditions, forming during a rising tide where a rising water-table forces air upwards to be trapped in moist sand. If found in ancient sequences, bubble-sand structures are a powerful environmental indicator of tidal conditions and, for beach sequences, an indicator of the high-tide level and sea level. Bubble-sand structures have been found in a number of ancient sequences throughout the geological record as far back as the Neoproterozoic, e.g. within beach-to-dune stratigraphy in Pleistocene limestones of the Perth Basin and in southeastern USA, and in tidal-flat sands of the Mesozoic Broome Sandstone of the Canning Basin. The bubble-sand structure is a significant geological tool for use in paleo-environmental and paleo-oceanographic reconstructions, and determination of the position of a paleo-water-table. Given the rarity of their preservation, these occurrences of bubble-sand structures are of geoheritage significance in their own right and, depending on age of sequence and how common they are in the region, they may be nationally significant or globally significant.

AB  - The study of road loads on trucks plays a major role in assessing the effect of heavy-vehicle design on fuel conservation measures. Coastdown testing with full-scale vehicles in the field offers a good avenue to extract drag components, provided that random instrumentation faults and biased environmental conditions do not introduce errors into the results. However, full-scale coastdown testing is expensive, and environmental biases which are ever-present are difficult to control in the results reduction. Procedures introduced to overcome the shortcomings of full-scale field testing, such as wind tunnels and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), though very reliable, mainly focus on estimating the effects of aerodynamic drag forces to the neglect of other road loads which should be considered. The development of mechanical simulation software in recent years suggests it is becoming much easier to incorporate the effects of other road load forces in drag analyses and fuel conservation measures. This study analyzed road loads obtained using a typical mechanical simulation software under calm and zero-wind conditions. The results were compared to drag coefficients derived from field tests of a fully instrumented truck and published drag coefficient values. The study found that the aerodynamic drag coefficients obtained from the simulation software were higher than those of the field and published data. A calibration curve was developed using the field test results and simulated data to correct the simulated drag forces. Average drag coefficients obtained from the corrected simulation forces were found to fall within the range of published data. However, due to the limitations of the simulation software in fully accounting for environmental conditions encountered in the field, some sensitivities of the derived coefficients in the field were observed. The results from using the mechanical simulation software suggest reasonable estimates of total road loads can be derived if corrections are applied. Better estimates of the aerodynamic drag forces may be derived from other approaches such as CFD and wind tunnel tests.

AB  - This paper presents a comparative study of the parameter estimation methods which are based exclusively on the manufacturer's datasheets, for various technologies of photovoltaic (PV) modules, using the single diode five parameter model. Accurate determination of these parameters which arose from a diversification of models and methods dedicated to their estimations is still a challenge for researchers. In this study, two parameter estimation methods are employed: an iterative method which adjusts the series resistance and an analytical method based on the Lambert W function. These methods are used to calculate the five unknown parameters at Standard Test Conditions (STC) of three types of PV modules using different technologies, namely multicrystalline, monocrystalline, and thin-film. Five existing mathematical models are implemented to estimate the parameters of these PV modules under changing environmental conditions. These five models are classified from 1-5 for both parameter estimation methods. Each model is based on the combination of the reverse saturation current and the photocurrent. Then, the results of the different models simulations are compared with the measured data, which are extracted from datasheet characteristics in order to validate the reliability and evaluate the accuracy of the five models. The results of the implanted models indicate a high agreement between the measured data and the simulated I-V characteristics under varying temperature and irradiance. Moreover, the use of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) presents a good accuracy indicator for both methods. On the one hand, the results show that the combination of the analytical method of estimation with all five models guarantees the fewest errors between the estimated and measured data for the thin-film module under varying environmental conditions, especially at low temperature and high irradiance. On the other hand, the behavior of the two methods is almost the same for the monocrystalline and multicrystalline modules. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A combination of biotic indices, geo-accumulation (Igeo) index, and a multivariate approach were applied to assess the anthropogenic influence on the benthic community at five stations from 2018 to 2019 in the Swarnamukhi river estuary, Nellore, India. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis indicated that the Buckingham canal (BC) station showed azoic conditions and formed a separate cluster. Strong positive factor loadings of Cd (0.96), Al (0.93), Zn (0.91), Fe (0.90), Co (0.89), Cu (0.89), Ni (0.87), Pb (0.85), Cr (0.77), organic matter (0.94), Silt (0.92), and clay (0.93) and negative loading of sand (-0.90) showed the variability in sediment. AMBI results illustrated the disturbance status of each station and classified BC station as 'extremely disturbed' class, and M-AMBI assessed the ecological status as 'bad'. The I-geo index also revealed metal (Cd) contamination. The present study illustrated that the combined approach is effective for ecological assessment of coastal ecosystem.

AB  - Effects and objects associated with the cryosphere, the world of cold, are extremely diverse due to anomalous thermodynamic and electromagnetic properties of ice, intermediate strength of hydrogen bonds, broad occurrence of cryogenic systems, and combinations of these causes.
   Unlike many other processes, those in the cryosphere have variable rates. They can speed up or slow down under the effect of physicochemical properties of ice. Cryospheric time is a missing link between geological and biological time scales: humans feel the planetary dynamics via dynamics of the cryosphere.
   The world of cold has been an important agent in evolution, as it created conditions for the life origin and existence and has controlled the rates and mechanisms of biological processes.
   Modern technologies for data acquisition and sharing change both the form and methods of research. Discovering and exploring fast processes becomes possible due to advanced videorecording tools while progressively increasing remote sensing potentialities allow high-resolution imaging of objects in the Solar System. Real-time big data acquired by modern measurement systems bridge the gap between the conventional approaches to modeling of elementary processes and assessment of environment parameters.

AB  - An integrated indicator system was developed for determining synthetic environmental responses under multiple types of coastal reclamation engineering in the Yellow River estuary, China. Four types of coastal engineering works were analyzed, namely port construction, petroleum exploitation, fishery and aquaculture, and seawall defense. In addition, two areas with limited human disturbances were considered for comparison. From the weights of the response value for each indicator, port construction was determined to be the primary impact contributor among the four engineering works studies. Specifically, hydrodynamic conditions, ecological status, economic costs, and engineering intensity were on average 72.78%, 65.03%, 75.03%, and 66.35% higher than those of other engineering types. Furthermore, fishery and aquaculture impact on water quality was 42.51% higher than that of other engineering types, whereas seawall defense impact on landscape variation was 51.75% higher than that of other engineering types. The proposed indicator system may provide effective coastal management in future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, I argue that encounters with hydrogeologic processes encourage feminists to rethink the permeable surfaces between human bodies, ecological systems, and political events. Contemporary geographical accounts of environmental knowledge controversies are insufficiently attentive to how geologic processes exceed and undermine instrumental deliberative political solutions to environmental problems. Through a mobilization of feminist geophilosophy, I argue instead that the limits of instrumental knowledge are not merely produced by uncertainty or lack of evidence, but by the inhuman forces that condition feminist thinking itself. An investigation of a controversy surrounding the permeability of underground materials near a proposed in situ recovery uranium mine in South Dakota demonstrates that subterranean spaces have the ability to heighten a sense of the openness of our bodies to geological forces. Public and expert testimony of the hydrogeology of the region creatively extended scientific accounts to draw conclusions about the meaning and force of geology for the politics of uranium extraction. This essay contributes a unique account of environmental controversies in which materiality does not become instrumental or experiential knowledge but instead produces a creative understanding of permeable geologic materials which provokes feminist thought.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the bioaccumulation patterns of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn in the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa. Results showed that roots and leaves of C. nodosa tend to accumulate similar values of trace elements but significantly greater than rhizomes, which seem to act as transit organs. Cu was the only element with similar concentrations in the three organs. C. nodosa showed no correlation with trace elements in water, whereas Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn in sediments were correlated with C nodosa. This study showed also that C nodosa tends to adopt an exclusion strategy for some toxic elements like Cr except As. In general, the roots and leaves of C. nodosa acted as bioindicators of several trace elements in sediments. Leaves are easier to sample and are suggested for short-term monitoring, given their periodic turnover. In turn, roots are more suitable for collecting historical information on past environmental conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The complex nature of the mechanisms behind cardiovascular diseases prevents the detection of latent early risk conditions. Network representations are ideally suited to investigate the complex interconnections between the individual components of a biological system that underlies complex diseases. Here, we investigate the patterns of correlations of an array of 29 metabolites identified and quantified in the plasma of 864 healthy blood donors and use a systems biology approach to define metabolite probabilistic networks specific for low and high latent cardiovascular risk. We adapted methods based on the likelihood of correlation and methods from information theory and combined them with resampling techniques. Our results show that plasma metabolite networks can be defined that associate with latent cardiovascular disease risk. The analysis of the networks supports our previous finding of a possible association between cardiovascular risk and impaired mitochondrial activity and highlights post-translational modifications (glycosilation and oxidation) of lipoproteins as a possible target-mechanism for early detection of latent cardiovascular risk.

AB  - Many land snail species of the European Pleistocene have recently been reported from Central Asia. The ecological conditions in which they live, however, are little known. We studied vascular plants and land snails along a climatic gradient in the Russian Altai Mountains. We recorded 566 plant and 40 mollusc species. In the most continental part of the Altai we discovered living Papilla loessica, a land snail now extinct in Europe and which is an important indicator of palaeoenvironments of the European Pleistocene. We inferred thermal ranges of the snail species in the Altai and observed considerable differentiation among the species. Moisture requirements of the species were indirectly estimated by using moisture indicator values of plant species co-occurring with the snails. They reveal local moisture requirement patterns that cannot be inferred from climate data. Snails are sorted along our transect; only a few species occur throughout the Altai. Many snails are able to occupy various plant communities. A few species may be indicators of vegetation types. For palaeoreconstructions, mollusc species are apparently good indicators for climate but less so for vegetation types.

AB  - Long-term monitoring began 20 years ago at Burnham Beeches Site of Special Interest (SSSI), National Nature Reserve (NNR) and European Special Area of Conservation (SAC) lying 40 km west of London as a consequence of the authorization of an application to extract gravel from an adjacent site lying north of Slough Trading Estate. Dust monitoring (sticky pads) and photographic monitoring, recording and image analysis was instigated in 1992 on Parmelion communities to assess changes in lichen growth, health and community composition. Long-term monitoring identifies that the lichen flora on free-standing trees has undergone rapid expansion from a near dominance by the SO2-tolerant 'acidophyte' species Lecanora conizaeoides and Hypogymnia physodes following reductions in SO2 concentrations. Long-term influences of low levels of eutrophication, gaseous pollutants (particularly globally rising background ozone concentrations) on lichen and bryophyte communities and succession under changing climatic conditions are unknown. Soil-plant relationships, lichen-invertebrate interactions and a pollution legacy must also be considered.

AB  - In the present work, the immunocytochemical detection of zeatin was performed in the shoot and rhizome of Posidonia oceanica (L.) plants, growing in two sites subjected to different types of anthropic pressure. P. oceanica, the predominant seagrass of the Mediterranean basin, plays a pivotal role in marine ecosystems; it is considered an excellent bioindicator of sea disturbance. Due to a wide range of factors, mostly related to human activities, a significant and widespread decline of P. oceanica meadows is currently underway. Hence, there is much interest towards finding novel descriptors of impaired features in this seagrass, which could be used in monitoring projects. Our data resulted in a specific distribution pattern of zeatin in plant shoots in relation to environmental stress factors, while no significant differences were observed in rhizomes. These results are consistent with the role of cytokinins in shoot morphogenesis and growth. On the basis of cytokinin involvement in the light-dependent signaling cascade and stress response, the putative relationship with light availability is also discussed.

AB  - Some trophic characteristics as chlorophyll-a, Secchi-disk transparency, turbidity, phytoplankton and bacterioplabkton abundances were investigated during spring and summer of 2005 in three reservoirs in northeastern Bulgaria, suggested by the experts of the Ministry of Environment and Waters (MEW) as potential reference sites. Different characteristics show differences in the assessment of the reservoir trophic status as only Tsonevo seems to be appropriate to reference site on the basis of the most of characteristics studied. Secchi-disk transparency seems to be inappropriate for assessment of the ecological status of the studied water bodies without considering its different components especially at the time of spring high waters. It is necessary to separate clearly different zones (water bodies) of reservoirs, which strongly depend on the morphometry, seasons, retention time and development of their shoreline. Phytoplankton (both abundance and composition) seems to be a good indicator for the differentiation of reservoir zones. Bacterial contribution to some of investigated variables (e.g. turbidity) and bacteria-algae relationships were also studied. Indication for top-down control of mixotrophic algae on bacteria was obtained under conditions of P-limitation.

AB  - A geo-environmental evaluation for urban land-use planning often requires a large amount of spatial information. Geographic information systems (GIS) are capable of managing large amounts of spatially related information, providing the ability to integrate multiple layers of information and to derive additional information. A GIS-aid to the geo-environmental evaluation for urban land-use planning is illustrated for the urban area of Lanzhou City and its vicinity in Northwest China. This evaluation incorporates topography, surficial and bedrock geology, groundwater conditions, and historic geologic hazards. Urban land-use is categorized according to the types of land-use and projects planned, such as high-rise building, multi-storey building, low-rise building, waste disposal, and natural conservation. Multi-criteria analysis is performed to evaluate development suitability of the geo-environment for each category, according to appropriately measured and weighted factors. A suitability map for each category is developed using an algorithm that combines factors in weighted linear combinations. It is demonstrated that the GIS methodology has high functionality for geo-environmental assessment. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The control of NOx emissions from coal combustion is a major factor in reducing the environmental impact of coal-fired power plants. This paper investigates the effect of sulphur on NO production in pulverised coal dames using an experimental approach. The NO emissions from a 20 kW down-fired combustor were measured with and without SO: doping for a range of operating conditions and coal types with total sulphur contents between 0.6 and 2.9%. Some tests were repeated using coals that were acid-washed to remove pyritic sulphur. The NO emissions were statistically correlated against 52 parameters describing the physical and chemical properties of the coals.
   The experimental results show that the change in the NO emission due to SO2 addition is dependent upon the stoichiometry of the flame and that sulphur can interact with the production of NO in a heterogeneous coal flame in a manner similar to that reported previously for gaseous and liquid fuel flames. For fuel-rich conditions, sulphur addition enhanced the production of NO from fuel-bound nitrogen by up to around 20%. The change was larger for coals with a lower inherent fuel-S content (<0.5 wt%). The experimental trends also provide strong evidence that the in-flame sulphur nitrogen interactions are controlled by the availability and production of inorganic (pyritic) sulphur from the coal matrix. This is supported by statistical correlation of the data which has identified specific coal properties, such as pyritic sulphur content and the total volatile yield, as being amongst the most influential parameters in predicting the NO emission for the system employed. These parameters are the key indicators for the release of sulphur at low to intermediate temperatures and would imply that the NO enhancement mechanism under fuel-rich conditions appears to be associated with the early release of pyritic-S into the developing flame to subsequently interact with volatile nitrogeneous species. <(c)> 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Estuarine systems are critical transition zones influenced by sea, land and freshwater. An array of human activi-ties impacts these areas leading to multiple-stressor interactions. Temperature and salinity are among the most relevant drivers in estuaries, shaping species growth, reproduction and distribution. However, few studies provide an overview of cellular rewiring processes under multiple-stressor environments. Here, we tested how salinity could shape the response of ragworms Hediste diversicolor, an important bioindicator and commercial species, to elevated temperature. We exposed polychaetes to three temperatures for a month, simulating control, ocean warming and heatwave conditions (24, 27 and 30 degrees C, respectively) combined with two salinities (20 and 30). We quantified whole-organism performance (wet weight gain and survival), along with cellular stress re-sponse (CSR) and energy reserves of worms after 14 and 28 days of exposure. Significant three-way interactions between temperature, salinity and exposure time show the non-linearity of molecular responses. Worms at a salinity of 20 were more sensitive to warming than worms exposed to a salinity of 30. The combination of high temperature and low salinity can act synergistically to induce oxidative stress and macromolecular damage in worm tissues. This finding was supported by an induction of the CSR, with a concomitant decrease of energy reserves, pointing towards a metabolic compensation strategy. However, under a higher salinity (30), the need for a CSR upon thermal challenge was reduced and energy content increased with temperature, which suggests that environmental conditions were within the optimum range. Heatwaves striking low-salinity areas of estuaries can therefore negatively impact the cellular physiology of H. diversicolor, with greater metabolic costs. However, extreme stress levels were not reached as worms incremented wet weight and survival was high under all conditions tested. Our findings are important for the optimization of ragworm aquaculture and adaptive conservation strategies of estuarine systems. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The study relevance is associated with the need of increasing the reliability of welded joints in steam power plants, hence with a rational use of product materials due to improvement and development of methods for studying the physical characteristics.
   Purpose of the study is to introduce the new nanoscale structural criteria of the third kind to assess the surface condition.
   Object of the study is specimens of heat-resistant steel tubular heating surfaces of steam boilers.
   Methods include physical modeling of operating conditions by thermal cycling in the MIMP-10UE electric furnace, cyclic cold deformation by means of a hydraulic press, roentgenometry of specimens with evaluation of the root-mean-square deviations and internal structural stresses using the DRON X-ray diffractometers, analysis of surface morphology with the portable electron microscope PENSCKOPE with 20x magnification.
   Results. Experimental studies, related to quantitative evaluation of the amplitude of atomic vibration and its evolution during cyclic thermal and mechanical loads, resulted in introduction of a new diagnostic parameter - the amplitude of atomic vibration (U) over bar (2), reflecting the fundamental nature of interatomic bonds. Correlation between the root-mean-square deviations of atoms (the microscale level of properties), which are the microstructural characteristics of the third kind, and the macromechanical characteristics sigma(0.2) and sigma(B) (the macroscale level of properties) was demonstrated. As the offset yield point and ultimate strength point are related to strength and breaking, then the rootmean-square deviations of atoms can be used as an indicator for damage and an indicator of limit states. The parameter (U) over bar (2) can also be a characteristic of the current physical state of metal. The new method for assessment of current and limit states was suggested. It was shown that structure restoration is monitored at the atomic microscale level, using the vibration amplitude and the stresses of the first kind.

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) is an indicator of sustainable land management as stated in the global indicator framework of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG Indicator 15.3.1). Improved forecasting of future changes in SOM is needed to support the development of more sustainable land management under a changing climate. Current models fail to reproduce historical trends in SOM both within and during transition between ecosystems. More realistic spatio-temporal SOM dynamics require inclusion of the recent paradigm shift from SOM recalcitrance as an 'intrinsic property' to SOM persistence as an 'ecosystem interaction'. We present a soil profile, or pedon-explicit, ecosystem-scale framework for data and models of SOM distribution and dynamics which can better represent land use transitions. Ecosystem-scale drivers are integrated with pedon-scale processes in two zones of influence. In the upper vegetation zone, SOM is affected primarily by plant inputs (above- and belowground), climate, microbial activity and physical aggregation and is prone to destabilization. In the lower mineral matrix zone, SOM inputs from the vegetation zone are controlled primarily by mineral phase and chemical interactions, resulting in more favourable conditions for SOM persistence. Vegetation zone boundary conditions vary spatially at landscape scales (vegetation cover) and temporally at decadal scales (climate). Mineral matrix zone boundary conditions vary spatially at landscape scales (geology, topography) but change only slowly. The thicknesses of the two zones and their transport connectivity are dynamic and affected by plant cover, land use practices, climate and feedbacks from current SOM stock in each layer. Using this framework, we identify several areas where greater knowledge is needed to advance the emerging paradigm of SOM dynamics-improved representation of plant-derived carbon inputs, contributions of soil biota to SOM storage and effect of dynamic soil structure on SOM storage-and how this can be combined with robust and efficient soil monitoring.

AB  - Research background: The commitment to increasing the volume of agricultural production remains the main strategy for food supply in Ukraine. In fact, such an approach does not solve the problem of the limitation of food's physical availability. It works quite the opposite way, as there is a guaranteed food loss and waste, worsened environmental situation and decreased level of economic availability of food.
   Purpose of the article: According to the results of the empirical study, the volume of food shortages has been determined as a result of food loss and waste, food surpluses in case of compliance with the rational consumption norms and zero food loss and waste, as well as potential social benefits from reducing food loss and waste.
   Methods: The research of the limitation of the physical availability of the different types of products as a result of food loss and waste was carried out according to the methodology developed by the authors. In particular, for the group of products in which the consumption deficit is established in a small number of regions the main indicator is the "production surplus in the conditions when the rational consumption norms and zero food loss are met"; for the group of products in which the consumption deficit is established in the vast majority of regions the main calculation indicators are the "production shortage in the conditions when the rational consumption norms and zero food loss are met" and the "specific gravity of the consumption shortage, which occurs as a result of food loss and waste".
   Findings & Value added: The obtained results are crucially important for shaping of the food security policy. Reducing of the food loss and waste has positive social consequences through the expansion of the physical availability of food, which, under other conditions, leads to greater economic availability of products, as well as contributes to the gender equality and poverty reduction for rural residents.

AB  - Riparian vegetation is important for stream functioning and as a major landscape feature. For many riparian plants, shallow groundwater is an important source of water, particularly in areas where rainfall is low, either annually or seasonally, and when extended dry conditions prevail for all or part of the year. The nature of tree water relationships is highly complex. Therefore, we used multiple lines of evidence to determine the water sources used by the dominant tree species Eucalyptus camaldulensis (river red gum), growing in riparian and floodplain areas with varying depth to groundwater and stream perenniality. Dendrometer bands were used to measure diel, seasonal, and annual patterns of tree water use and growth. Water stable isotopes (delta H-2 and delta O-18) in plant xylem, soil water, and groundwater were measured to determine spatial and temporal patterns in plant water source use. Our results indicated riparian trees located on relatively shallow groundwater had greater growth rates, larger diel responses in stem diameter, and were less reactive to extended dry periods, than trees in areas of deep groundwater. These results were supported by isotope analysis that suggested all trees used groundwater when soil water stores were depleted at the end of the dry season, and this was most pronounced for trees with shallow groundwater. Trees may experience more frequent periods of water deficit stress and undergo reduced productivity in scenarios where water table accessibility is reduced, such as drawdown from groundwater pumping activities or periods of reduced rainfall recharge. The ability of trees to adapt to changing groundwater conditions may depend on the speed of change, the local hydrologic and soil conditions as well as the species involved. Our results suggest that E. camaldulesis growing at our study site is capable of utilizing groundwater even to depths >10 m, and stream perenniality is likely to be a useful indicator of riparian tree use of groundwater.

AB  - Over the years, several proxies have been developed to reconstruct rainfall variability. However, most rely on indirect approaches to provide qualitative paleorainfall estimate. In an attempt to obtain a more direct measure of paleorainfall, Shankar et al. (2006) explored the rock magnetic properties of lake sediments from Thimmannanayakanakere (TK) in tropical southern India. They proposed the use of magnetic susceptibility as a proxy for rainfall in the tropics. Warner and Shankar (2009) provided geochemical evidence in support of this proposition. Here, sedimentological and carbonate data is provided as further evidence to bolster Shankar et al.'s (2006) proposition. High (low) values of chi(if) indicate high (low) rainfall in the region of TK during the past 3700 years. Particle size variations suggest that the sand % was high (low) during arid (humid) periods, when the TK(lake level was low (high). Hence, a negative correlation is documented between sand % and;cif along with other rock magnetic parameters. HIRIVI (an indicator of magnetically "hard" minerals like haematite and goethite) is suggestive of a relatively arid climate; the high (low) HIRM values in TK sediments indicate arid (humid) conditions. For this reason, sand % is positively correlated with HIRM. By contrast, fine silt and clay contents are low during low-rainfall periods and vice versa. Thus, both fine silt and clay contents are positively correlated with;of and other rock magnetic parameters, but negatively correlated with HIRM. Magnetic minerals reside principally in the fine silt fraction of TK sediments as evidenced from the positive correlation between fine silt content and magnetic susceptibility. Carbonate content too is indicative of paleorainfall conditions, being high (low) during arid (humid) climatic conditions. Based on the chi(if), sand % and carbonate % data, we have inferred lake level variations in TK during the past 3700 years. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - PARTEL (Ecology 83: 2361-2366, 2002) and EWALD (Folia Geobot. 38: 357-366, 2003) suggest that the relationship between local species density and soil pH is determined by regional species pool size, which in turn reflects the relative abundance of soil types during the evolutionary history of the flora. Ewald observed that calcareous sites in Central Europe have higher species density and larger species pools than acidic sites, and argues that this is the consequence of a Pleistocene bottleneck for acidophiles.
   The flora of the southern Blue Ridge Mountains USA has always been associated with primarily acidic soils. We used vegetation and soil data from 3328 100 m(2) southern Blue Ridge forest plots to examine the generality of the Partel-Ewald hypothesis. The Blue Ridge flora with less than 20% of species confined to sites above pH 4.7 contrasts dramatically with that of Europe. However, regional species pool size increases with pH. Genus- and family-level pools increase with pH, suggesting an ancient origin for this pattern. Mean species density is also strongly positively correlated with soil pH. Thus, both regional species pool size and plot species density of southern Blue Ridge forests fail to conform to predictions derived from the work of Partel and Ewald.
   The increase in species pool with increase in pH exhibited by southern Blue Ridge forests appears to reflect broad species distributions and tolerance for high pH conditions among species that grow predominantly under acid conditions. We conclude that richness on higher pH sites is a consequence of generally more favorable conditions for plant growth and/or establishment. Ewald may be correct in asserting that the abundance of high pH specialists in Central Europe is an historical artifact, but our data contradict the assertion of Partel and Ewald that evolution of a flora in a primarily low pH environment will necessarily translate into a negative correlation between pH and species density in local vegetation.

AB  - Forest fires may have severe impacts on the aboveground biodiversity and soil chemical and biological properties. Edaphic organisms are highly sensitive to disturbances and are typically used to measure the magnitude of these events. Overall, little is known about the responses of these organisms to fires differing in their severity levels. This study aimed to assess the effect of fire severity on the soil mesofauna community diversity and structure in a site located in a Mediterranean zone of central Chile. In postfire conditions, we use spectral indexes from satellite images to map fire severity at four levels (non-damage (ND), low damage (L), medium damage (M), high damage (H)). Soil samples were collected at each severity level, and the mesofauna abundance was quantified. Although the metrics describing species diversity and dominance were similar among fire severity levels, the abundance and composition of the mesofauna were specifically altered at the high severity level. The edaphic mesofauna can be considered suitable bioindicators to evaluate the postfire ecosystem recovery, especially in the areas highly damaged by fire.

AB  - This review is a survey of recent advances in studies concerning the impact of poly- and perfluorinated organic compounds in aquatic organisms. After a brief introduction on poly- and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) features, an overview of recent monitoring studies is reported illustrating ranges of recorded concentrations in water, sediments, and species. Besides presenting general concepts defining bioaccumulative potential and its indicators, the biodistribution of PFCs is described taking in consideration different tissues/organs of the investigated species as well as differences between studies in the wild or under controlled laboratory conditions. The potential use of species as bioindicators for biomonitoring studies are discussed and data are summarized in a table reporting the number of monitored PFCs and their total concentration as a function of investigated species. Moreover, biomolecular effects on taxonomically different species are illustrated. In the final paragraph, main findings have been summarized and possible solutions to environmental threats posed by PFCs in the aquatic environment are discussed.

AB  - The chemo-enzymatic epoxidation of Lallemantia iberica seed oil (LISO), a novel plant oil characterized by its exceptional high content of alpha-linolenic acid (> 60%), was developed using an immobilized lipase from Pseudozyma antarctica and hydrogen peroxide as oxidant. A statistical approach was used to study the effect of enzyme amount, temperature, time, and solvent amount on the oxirane oxygen content obtained during epoxidation. An oxirane oxygen content of 8.6 +/- 0.2% corresponding to a yield of 82% was obtained under optimized conditions that were identified to be at an enzyme load of 8.2 g/mol of double bonds, a solvent amount of 56.4 wt.%, a temperature of 33 A degrees C, and an incubation time of 17 h. In addition, the experimental investigation was combined with a techno-economic and ecological assessment gaining detailed information regarding cost structure and environmental impact for the chemo-enzymatic epoxidation of the novel plant oil.

AB  - Herpetofauna (amphibians and reptiles) and fish represent important sentinel and indicator species for environmental and ecosystem health. It is widely accepted that the epigenome plays an important role in gene expression regulation. Environmental stimuli, including temperature and pollutants, influence gene activity, and there is growing evidence demonstrating that an important mechanism is through modulation of the epigenome. This has been primarily studied in human and mammalian models; relatively little is known about the impact of environmental conditions or pollutants on herpetofauna or fish epigenomes and the regulatory consequences of these changes on gene expression. Herein we review recent studies that have begun to address this deficiency, which have mainly focused on limited specific epigenetic marks and individual genes or large-scale global changes in DNA methylation, owing to the comparative ease of measurement. Greater understanding of the epigenetic influences of these environmental factors will depend on increased availability of relevant species-specific genomic sequence information to facilitate chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA methylation experiments.

AB  - Do nematode and macrofauna assemblages provide similar ecological assessment information? To answer this question, in the summer of 2006, subtidal soft-bottom assemblages were sampled and environmental parameters were measured at seven stations covering the entire salinity gradient of the Mondego estuary. Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed on the environmental parameters, thus establishing different estuarine stretches. The ecological status of each community was determined by applying the Maturity Index and the Index of Trophic Diversity to the nematode data and the Benthic Assessment Tool to the macrofaunal data. Overall, the results indicated that the answer to the initial question is not straightforward. The fact that nematode and macrofauna have provided different responses regarding environmental status may be partially explained by local differentiation in microhabitat conditions, given by distinct sampling locations within each estuarine stretch and by different response-to-stress times of each benthic community. Therefore, our study suggests that both assemblages should be used in marine pollution monitoring programs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Characterizing, modeling, and monitoring the distribution and condition of the Earth's biodiversity and ecosystems has a long history of being aided by Earth Observation data and the models and derivative products that they support. At the global scale, there need to be more coordinated efforts to acquire, process, analyze, and make available these observation data across all disciplines, particularly since many applications use the same primary and derived data. Towards that end, the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) is implementing the Global Earth Observing System of Systems. The purpose of this article is to provide information on GEO's goals and activities relevant to biodiversity and ecosystems. The article also describes the data that would best serve as a year 2010 baseline in order to support the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) as well as many other international agreements, programs, and activities. Indeed, an assessment of existing biodiversity observations with a concomitant recognition of the remaining gaps will promote the establishment of an integrated framework for biodiversity observations in support of the CBD's efforts.

AB  - The present work was carried out to investigate the effects of dietary propolis supplementation to laying Japanese quail (Cotumix coturnix japonica) on egg production, egg quality, physiological and immunological aspects under heat stress conditions. A total of 200, 21-day-old, Japanese quail females were distributed equally into standard wired cages in two identical environmentally-controlled rooms (10 cages per room, 10 birds per cage). From 29-70 d of age, the quail birds in the first room remained at a normal temperature of 24 degrees C (C group), whereas the quail birds in the second room were kept under heat stress at 35 degrees C (HS group). Each group was further assigned to 2 propolis subgroups (5 cages per subgroup); one of them received a basal diet without propolis supplementation (-PR subgroup), while, the other received 1 g propolis/ kg basal diet (+PR subgroup). In the present study, performance and egg production of laying quail were significantly (P<0.001) impaired by HS treatment and improved by the PR treatment. Similarly, the negative and positive effects of HS and PR, respectively, were appeared on the egg shell thickness and yolk index. Stress indicators in laying quail were significantly (P<0.001) increased by HS, while, PR significantly (P<0.05) moderated these levels in the HS+PR group when compared to the HS-PR quail group. In addition to the positive impact of PR on the plasma levels of calcium, phosphorus, and albumin, it also normalized the plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase and cholesterol in the heat-stressed quail birds. Moreover, the quail birds in the HS groups expressed lower immunological aspects than those in the C group, while, the addition of propolis to the diets enhanced the immune status of laying quail birds under HS conditions. These results strongly suggest that dietary propolis supplementation could be a successful attempt to maintain the performance and egg production of laying Japanese quail at convenient levels under heat stress conditions.

AB  - Environmental factors greatly influence grape quality. Among them, the effect of within-vineyard variability of soil in relation to soil moisture on table grape under protected condition has rarely been studied. In this present research, we investigated the influence of soil variability, in relation with soil moisture on chlorophyll fluorescence, yield and quality attributes of the "Summer Black" (Vitis vinifera L. x V. labruscana L.) table grape, popularly grown under double cropping system in protected covering in the southern part of China. The vineyard was divided vertically into three sites ( lower, middle and upper, 192, 202 and 212 m above sea level, respectively) and data on soil moisture and other yield and quality parameters were recorded. Among the three vineyard sites, middle site resulted in higher yield compared to the upper and lower sites during winter and summer cropping cycles. However, compared to regular summer cycle, winter cycle provided grapevines with higher quality attributes. Polyphasic OJIP fluorescence transient exhibited a considerable increase in fluorescence intensity at J, I and P phase in the upper and middle sites compared to the lower site due to variation in soil moisture in both seasons. Values of fluorescence parameters including minimal fluorescence, relative variable fluorescence at phase J and I, the maximal quantum yield of photosystem II were also influenced by soil moisture in different sites. Different sites also exhibited a significant difference in total phenolics, flavonoid, antioxidant activity and individual anthocyanin which was influenced by available soil moisture. The present study shows that chlorophyll fluorescence OJIP transient can be used as a sensitive indicator to determine the moisture stress in grape grown in a varied soil. Double cropping proved to be a powerful technique to improve the fruit quality. This result may be useful for the table grape growers to better utilize the vineyard soil variability with water management to get higher yield and quality table grape under protected condition.

AB  - Research background: Quality of life is viewed as the degree of people's satisfaction of various needs. especially including material, spiritual, safety-related needs and life aspirations. The aspects taken into consideration are economic, spatial, environmental and cultural ones. Quality of life is therefore determined by various conditions in Which a human lives and the source of which is the hierarchy of needs and a value system. At the same time, quality of lite can be viewed in tarns of collectivity (objective aspect) and an individual's evaluation (subjective aspect). The former view shapes the existing living conditions and the latter results from the satisfaction from a specific person's life, experiences and ambitions. The multidimensionality of the quality of life categories translates into difficulties in defining and measuring it, and constitutes an interesting research object.
   Purpose of the article: The purpose of the article is to diagnose and evaluate the variety of the quality of life in Polish voivodeships, in objective terms by building a synthetic measure allowing for estimating inequalities in the quality of life of regional communities. It was assumed that quality of life will be characterised by indicators grouped into the following areas: material living conditions, economic activity, health, education and living environment quality.
   Methods: The main method used for measuring quality of life is the linear ordering based on Z. Hellnig's taxonomic measure which allows for organising voivodeships in terms of the quality of life of communities. Additionally, the cluster analysis (Ward's agglomerative grouping method) was used. which allowed for distinguishing voivodeships similar in terms or the analysed phenomenon.
   Findings & Value added: During the realisation of the research goal, special attention was paid to the complexity of the wraith of hie issue and its measurement in terms of economy and rather important V arieties in voivodeships were emphasized. the conducted analysis allowed for distinguishing groups of regions with the highest, high, low and the lowest quality of life.

AB  - Drought limits tree water use and growth of Mediterranean trees. However, growth and water use strategies are rarely addressed simultaneously across species and drought conditions. Here, we investigate the link between stem diameter variations and sap flow in four co-existing Mediterranean trees (Pinus halepensis Mill., Quercus pubescens Willd., Quercus ilex L and Arbutus unedo L), under relatively wet (2011) and dry (2012) conditions. Continuous stem diameter variations were converted to basal area increment (BAI) and de-trended to estimate tree water deficit (Delta W), an indicator of stem hydration. P. halepensis and Q pubescens showed the most and the least conservative sap flow density (J(s)) regulation under drought, respectively, with Q ilex and A.unedo showing intermediate drought responses. All species, except A. unedo, showed some between-year variability in the environmental control of J(s). Seasonal stem shrinkage in response to drought (i.e., increasing Delta W) and subsequent trunk rehydration after rainfall (i.e., decreasing Delta W) occurred in all species. Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and soil moisture (theta) interacted to determine seasonal variation in Delta W. Interestingly, in the dry year, 2012, more species-specific differences were found in the responses of Delta W to theta and VPD. Across species, J(s) and Delta W began to decline at similar soil moisture thresholds, underpinning the tight link between J(s) and Delta W under varying drought conditions. Annual BAI decreased proportionally more than tree-level transpiration (J(T)) between the wet (2011) and the dry (2012) year, hence growth-based WUE (WUEBAI = BAI/J(T)) decreased for all species, albeit less acutely for P. halepensis. Overall, despite their contrasting leaf habit and wood type, the studied Mediterranean tree species show coordinated responses of transpiration, water storage dynamics and growth-based WUE which allow them to cope with seasonal and interannual drought.

AB  - There is an increasing need for strategic global assessments of flood risks in current and future conditions. In this paper, we propose a framework for global flood risk assessment for river floods, which can be applied in current conditions, as well as in future conditions due to climate and socio-economic changes. The framework's goal is to establish flood hazard and impact estimates at a high enough resolution to allow for their combination into a risk estimate, which can be used for strategic global flood risk assessments. The framework estimates hazard at a resolution of similar to 1 km(2) using global forcing datasets of the current (or in scenario mode, future) climate, a global hydrological model, a global flood-routing model, and more importantly, an inundation downscaling routine. The second component of the framework combines hazard with flood impact models at the same resolution (e. g. damage, affected GDP, and affected population) to establish indicators for flood risk (e. g. annual expected damage, affected GDP, and affected population). The framework has been applied using the global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB, which includes an optional global flood routing model DynRout, combined with scenarios from the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE). We performed downscaling of the hazard probability distributions to 1 km(2) resolution with a new downscaling algorithm, applied on Bangladesh as a first case study application area. We demonstrate the risk assessment approach in Bangladesh based on GDP per capita data, population, and land use maps for 2010 and 2050. Validation of the hazard estimates has been performed using the Dartmouth Flood Observatory database. This was done by comparing a high return period flood with the maximum observed extent, as well as by comparing a time series of a single event with Dartmouth imagery of the event. Validation of modelled damage estimates was performed using observed damage estimates from the EM-DAT database and World Bank sources. We discuss and show sensitivities of the estimated risks with regard to the use of different climate input sets, decisions made in the downscaling algorithm, and different approaches to establish impact models.

AB  - In this paper the progress made in producing predictions of the Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI) over Kenya in the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA) for the October-December (OND) season is discussed. Several studies have identified a statistically significant relationship between rainfall and NDVI in the region. Predictability of seasonal rainfall by global climate models (GCMs) during the OND season over the GHA has also been established as being among the best in the world. Information was extracted from GCM seasonal prediction output using statistical transformations. The extracted information was then used in the prediction of NDVI. NDVI is a key variable for management of various climate-sensitive problems. For example. it has been shown to have the potential to predict environmental conditions associated with Rift Valley Fever (RVF) viral activity and this is referred to throughout the paper as a motivation for the study. RVF affects humans and livestock and is particularly economically important in the GHA. The establishment of predictability for NDVI in this paper is therefore part of a methodology that could ultimately generate information useful for managing RVF in livestock in the GHA. It has been shown that NDVI can be predicted skillfully over the GHA with a 2-3-month lead time. Such information is crucial for tailoring forecast information to support RVF monitoring and prediction over the region, as well as many other potential applications (e.g., livestock forage estimation). More generally, the Famine Early Warning System (FEWS). a project of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and other specialized technical centers routinely use NDVI images to monitor environmental conditions worldwide. The high predictability for NDVI established in this paper could therefore supplement the routine monitoring of environmental conditions for a wide range of applications.

AB  - The Arcellacean (Thecamoebian) fauna was assessed in five Holocene sediment cores obtained from James and Granite lakes in the Temagami region of northeastern Ontario. In addition, palynological analysis was carried out on two of these cores, one each from James and Granite lakes. The first indication of postglacial colonization by plants was the appearance of rare Cupressaceae pollen, dated to 10,800 yr BP. Plant diversity began to increase by 10,770 yr BP when Pinus spp. and Larix migrated into the area. The first appearance of arcellaceans occurred after 9650 yr BP in assemblages dominated by Centropyxis constricta and opportunistic Centropyxis aculeata. High abundances of charophytes in the cores until 8800 yr BP indicated that macroalgae were proliferating at this time. This deposition is interpreted to have occurred during the draining of an ice-marginal lake following the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Based on pollen analysis, warmer conditions associated with the Holocene Hypsithermal prevailed in the area from 6250 to 4115 yr BP. The stable, open Great Lakes - St. Lawrence type forest that developed here at the beginning of the Hypsithermal continues to prevail to the present. The periodic colonization of the lake by beavers ( Castor canadensis) acted as a control on water- level and eutrophication through the Holocene. Evidence of eutrophication was indicated in the core samples by the abundance of high levels of the alga Pediastrum and the arcellacean Cucurbitella tricuspis. Eutrophication periodically developed when beavers dammed a site, causing the rate of flow in drainage streams to slow and stagnant conditions occurred. When the site became depleted of the nearby trees, which were preferred by beaver ( Betula, Alnus and Populus), the dam would be abandoned, causing the water- level to drop. Stagnant conditions were reduced as flow levels increased, reducing eutrophication and resulting in recovering forest stands. In addition, the lowering water levels would result in encroachment of the forest along the lake shore. This cycle occurred many times in the history of this lake as indicated by fluctuations in the size of arcellacean populations.

AB  - Modern economic world tendencies and practice of the developed countries testify that in the conditions of the high level of financial risks and influence of various crisis factors, one of the main problems of operation of enterprises is to ensure sustainable development. In such conditions, the innovative activity is the basis for ensuring the competitiveness of domestic enterprises and provision of sustainable development. Effective implementation of innovation activities involves the introduction of strategic management. An enterprise, which is a part of the external environment, must be able to adapt to existing and possible changes in the external environment to ensure effective activity. Success can be achieved not by those enterprises that are capable of forming a successful strategy, but those capable of adapting it in time to changes. In this regard, the issues of strategic management of innovation activity are very relevant for domestic enterprises. The question of the analysis of strategic management effectiveness is presented by I. Ansoff, Michael E. Porter, by Robert S. Kaplan, by David P. Norton. Issues related to the strategic management of innovation activities are studied by such scholars as S.M. Ilyashenko, N.M. Poliova, V.O. Shpyliova, I.L. Fedulova, T.M. Yankovets and others. The aim of the work is to improve the methodological bases for the formation of concepts and choice of innovative business strategies. Methodology. On the basis of the retrospective analysis, synthesis, and generalization, the existing methodological bases of the formation of concepts and choice of innovative strategies of enterprises are systematized and improved. The results of the study show that the innovative strategy is a certain interrelated sequence of actions to ensure the effective innovation of the enterprise in the light of the general strategy in the conditions of resource limitation and the impact of the external environment. It is established that the perspective direction of activation of the innovative strategy is the introduction of strategic maps and the system of balanced indicators. The practical implementation. It is reasonable to introduce one of the stages of the formation of an innovative strategy for drawing up a strategic map that will take into account different variants of the course of innovation activity and can serve as a basis for the formation and adjustment of the following innovative strategies of industrial enterprises. Value/originality. The inclusion of the strategic map to the stages of formation of innovative strategy will increase the efficiency of the financial support of innovation activity, as the management of the enterprise will work out a plan of action under different conditions of the course of innovation activity. In addition, an innovative strategy, especially in terms of financial support for innovation, must be integrated into a system of Balanced Scorecard of the enterprise.

AB  - Macroinvertebrates are a crucial component of wetland trophic webs. Many taxa are used as bioindicators of ecosystem change. However, relationships between macroinvertebrates and the environmental factors in peat pool habitats are still not well recognized. The present study shows the results of long-term studies during the years 2010-2020, on the responses of macroinvertebrates to the changes of environmental variables in a peat pool habitat formed as a result of peat exploitation on continental raised bog. The RDA analysis significantly explained 87.3% of the variance in macroinvertebrates abundances. Assemblages of most taxa (Anisoptera, Chironomidae, Ceratopogonidae, Coleoptera, Hydrachnidia and Tabanidae) showed a strong relationship with N-NO3 and pH. Moreover, densities of Chaoboridae larvae were explained by chlorophyll-a concentrations. Dominant taxon, Chironomidae, constituted from 48% to 87% of total faunal density. The highest proportions showed larvae of Psectrocladius sp. (gr. sordidellus) and Chironomus sp. Changes in the composition of macroinvertebrate fauna over a period of 10 years reflect the eutrophication process of the peat pool and deterioration of habitat conditions.

AB  - In order to reasonably evaluate the ecological environment of Dari County in the source region of the Yellow River, the characteristics and actual conditions of Dari County's ecological environment are taken into account, and the principles of representativeness, scientificity, operability and systematicness of index are followed. An evaluation index system is established for Dari County based on the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) conceptual framework. Combining the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) with the cloud model, an ecological environment evaluation model for Dari County is established, and the ecological environment of Dari County is quantitatively evaluated. The model organically combines the ambiguity and randomness of the uncertainty concept. It not only describes the ambiguity of the evaluation level with a membership function, but also considers the randomness of the membership itself using the concept of superentropy, which is more in line with the actual evaluation object. The results indicate that the ecological situation of Dari County is in a 'general' state that should be urgently protected for sustainable development, and land degradation is the most important factor affecting the ecological environment of Dari County.

AB  - According to the United Nations forecasts, by 2050 the number of Russian citizens will decline to 132.7 million, mainly due to a decrease in the number of rural residents. Negative demographic trends are also noted in the Penza region, where over the past 25 years the population has decreased by 235 thousand people. In this context, the goal of the paper was the identification of socio-economic problems in rural areas based on a comprehensive analysis of the demographic situation, production potential, social structure and other factors, taking into account their potential change in conditions of turbulence in the external environment. The article analyzes the size of the rural population, its distribution by major age groups, household sizes. Indicators of life expectancy, natural movement and migration of the population of the Penza region and the Volga Federal District are reflected. Taking into account the actual socio-economic problems of the rural population and trends in the rural demography, the state should develop a new strategy for increasing birth rate, for decreasing mortality, assuring jobs and a corresponding living standard and life quality.

AB  - The Global Biogeochemical Cycles (GBCs) are extremely important biosphere functions, critical to the maintenance of conditions necessary for all life. Importantly, perturbation of the GBCs has the potential to affect the structure and functioning of the Earth system. While biogeochemistry research to date has largely focused on 'natural' processes, human economic activities are increasingly recognised as integral components of the GBCs. In this paper we develop a novel systems model, the Environmental Social Accounting Matrix (ESAM), of coupled GBCs (explicitly covering Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Sulphur) with a particularly focus on the environment-economy interface. We illustrate diagrammatically the level at which the global economy, through its transformation of useful resources (i.e. raw materials) into residuals (i.e. wastes, pollutants, emission), appropriates biogeochemical processes. Then through an application lens we discuss the ESAM's potential applications and extensions. The ESAM represents one of only a few attempts to develop an integrated model of the Earth system, explicitly capturing the interaction in the element-based GBCs between both natural and human processes.

AB  - Robust inferences of environmental condition come from bioindicators that have strong relationships with stressors and are minimally confounded by extraneous environmental variables. These indicator properties are generally assumed for assemblage-based indicators such as diatom transfer functions that use species abundance data to infer environmental variables. However, failure of assemblage approaches necessitates the interpretation of individual dominant taxa when making environmental inferences. To determine whether diatom species from Laurentian Great Lakes sediment cores have the potential to provide unambiguous inferences of anthropogenic stress, we evaluated fossil diatom abundance against a suite of historical environmental gradients: human population, agriculture, mining, atmospheric nutrient deposition, atmospheric temperature and ice cover. Several diatom species, such as Stephanodiscus parvus, had reliable relationships with anthropogenic stress such as human population. However, many species had little or no indicator value or had confusing relationships with multiple environmental variables, suggesting one should be careful when using those species to infer stress in the Great Lakes. Recommendations for future approaches to refining diatom indicators are discussed, including accounting for the effects of broad species geographic distributions to minimize region-specific responses that can weaken indicator power.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of stereotypic behavior on productivity measures in sows. Frequent expression of stereotypies by pigs has been reported, even when pigs are not maintained in crates. This behavior is only observed in animals kept in captivity and is a wide-range welfare indicator, since it is considered to develop in situations of chronic stress or frustration. When comparing groups of sows showing low or high frequency of stereotypy expression, we found that stereotypic behavior did not affect productivity. Moreover, it did not affect physiological welfare indicators, such as salivary cortisol concentration or glucocorticoids in the placenta. There were no differences in productivity parameters, including weight of sows, weight of piglets, number of piglets weaned, or piglet mortality. Our study was conducted in group-housing pens, where the sows were not confined. Even in this condition, which is considered for increasing welfare, the barren environment did not meet the behavioral and sensory needs of sows, which were naturally selected to perform complex behavioral repertoire and to spend part of their time engaging in exploratory behavior.

AB  - This paper investigates species indicator values in response to spatial gradients of environmental indices (light, L; moisture, F; nitrogen, N: temperature, T) in different agro-habitats (crop fields and their boundaries of intensive/conventional farming. IF; organic farming. OF) of Lithuania. All plant species were classified according to indicator values of the Ellenberg scale of general abiotic environmental factors (light, moisture, nitrogen, temperature) available for Central Europe. Multiple Correspondence Analysis was applied to analyze the patterns of relationships between species indicator values and environmental conditions in six different agro-habitats. Variation of N-values (ranging from 2 to 9 and x point) was observed to be the highest between ecological gradients, thus indicating wide spatial dispersion of soil N deposition in the habitats. The presence of particular plant species with medium indicator values (L5-L6, F4-F5, N5-N6, T4-T5) suggests that IF crop habitats are favored for establishment of mezophytes. Crop and margin habitats in OF agro-habitats were found to possess a wider environmental gradient, ensuring higher biodiversity.

AB  - Herbicides are chemical compounds widely used in agriculture. As their intensive application is becoming a cause of environmental pollution, detailed and more sophisticated investigations are needed to understand better their consequences at the biological level. After herbicides are dispersed in the fields, they establish chemical interactions with both target and non-target plants. In both cases, herbicides can interact with the plant reproductive apparatus; consequently they could play a role during the fertilisation process in higher plants. Using an antibody to the alpha -tubulin subunit in immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy techniques, we investigated the distribution of microtubules in Nicotiana tabacum pollen tubes grown under in vitro conditions in the presence of five different herbicides selected among those used frequently in central Italy. Herbicides have a specific effect on the microtubular apparatus of both pollen tube and generative cell. In addition to other tests and assays, these results suggest that the microtubule cytoskeleton of pollen tubes can be used as a bioindicator for studying the toxicity effects induced by herbicides.

AB  - This study examined ecosystem function via measures of litter decomposition in restored and unrestored reaches in a range of urban rivers in Greater London. Land use at the study rivers was 47-93 % urban cover, while restorations comprised activities that improved flow conditions and remeandered channels. Using standard litter bag techniques, we found rates of decomposition ranged from 0.001 to 0.012 per degree day. However, no differences in litter decomposition rates or associated macroinvertebrate community structure were found between restored and unrestored reaches. These findings illustrate that river restoration may not necessarily lead to ecological enhancement even if there are highly valued aesthetic improvements. We suggest the lack of an ecological response in our study reinforces the need for a better understanding of the outcomes expected from restoration activities in urban rivers. Further, our research highlights the need for a better understanding of the goals of river restoration, and the potential role that stochastic events play in regulating both the potential for restoration and the basic ecology of urban rivers.

AB  - Due to the location of manufacturing in north Hangzhou, many residential areas are close to trunk roads and factory areas. This potentially exposes citizens to pollution sources such as industrial emissions and vehicle exhaust. Because pollution by cadmium (Cd) is of great concern, an extensive survey was conducted in north Hangzhou city to study the current condition of Cd contamination and any resulting hazard. Environmental materials including water, bottom mud, urban green-land soil, street dust and moss were collected. Cd concentration and chemical partitioning in the samples were determined. The results indicate that all the media in north Hangzhou have elevated Cd concentrations, the Cd content trend being: factory area>traffic area>residential area. The chemical partitioning results show that Cd in topsoil and street dust presents are mobile (9-61% Cd are bound in acetic acid extractable phase), which suggests a high ecological hazard potential. Environmental bioindicator moss samples were found to be loaded with Cd revealing high bioavailability of Cd in various media in north Hangzhou. This confirms the possibility of Cd being a potential biohazard in this location.

AB  - There has been a call to include empathy as a selection criterion in medical training.
   Empathy is a complex construct currently assessed by self-rating and observational scales, which may be complicated by the subjectivity of such measurements.
   Neuroscientific research into disorders of empathy such as autism should be encouraged to help further refine the evolving construct of empathy.
   Empathy may be more common in females, and selection for higher empathy may discriminate against males unless sex-specific adjustments are included in selection criteria.
   Physician empathy may lead to greater patient satisfaction and confidence in physicians, but more evidence is needed to support links to physician competence. In contrast, academic performance and conscientiousness have been clearly linked to physician competence.
   Competence and empathy may be independent qualities developed by different aspects of medical training.
   Provision of better work conditions and environments for physicians may forestall erosion of empathy, reducing the need to predict and enhance its development.
   Empathy should be valued in medical students and doctors, but more research is needed into the nature, assessment, and correlates of empathy before its adoption as a selection criterion for medical students.

AB  - Anglesite (PbSO4) is a lead sulfate that belongs to the barite group and is naturally ubiquitous in the environment. This work describes a simple way to synthesize crystalline lead sulfate by using a straightforward hydrothermal procedure. Typically, Pb(NO3)(2) and Fe-2(SO4)(3) precursors were mixed and heated at 94 degrees C for 24 h. The synthesized samples have been characterized by coupling X-Ray diffraction (XRD) to spectroscopic methods (FTIR and micro-Raman), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and electronic microscopy (SEM and TEM). In fine, the results about this new well crystalline synthetic anglesite confirm the efficiency and the importance of this cheap protocol and the synthesized phases obtained. Moreover, the environmental stability and bioaccessibility of anglesite have been done to evaluate environmental stability of anglesite under various physico-chemical conditions and sanitary risks. Finally, the paper allows to obtain precise data on a pure phase in order to be able to more easily evaluate and understand the role of anglesite in as-polluted sites and soils.

AB  - This paper aims to compare two foraminiferal based biotic indices generally used to evaluate the ecological quality status (EcoQS): the Foram-AMBI and the Foram Stress Index (FSI). For this purpose, we report the distribution and diversity of living foraminiferal assemblages and the environmental variables from a bathymetric transect in the Southern Adriatic Sea. The two indices agree well with the detected organic enrichment but indicate conflicting EcoQS as the Foram-AMBI detects good environmental conditions, whereas the FSI describes a poor-moderate quality. Many species not assigned (including soft-shelled foraminifera) are to blame for the different results. Also, both foraminiferal-based indices neglect the heavy metal increase encountered in the deepest stations. These findings suggest the need for a more in-depth analysis to improve the ecological status evaluation of marine benthic systems, including other descriptors as chemical pollutants in combination with biotic indices sensitive to organic matter enrichment.

AB  - Mangroves in the Northwest Coast of South America are contaminated with heavy metals due to wastewater discharges from industries, affecting the biota from this environment. However, bacteria proliferate in these harsh environmental conditions becoming possible sentinel of these contaminations. In this study, bacterial community composition was analyzed by throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene from polluted and pristine mangrove sediments affected by marked differences in heavy metal concentrations. Core bacteria were dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes phyla, with strong differences between sites at class and genus levels, correlated with metal levels. Increment of abundance on specific OTUs were associated with either elevated or decreased concentrations of metals and with the sulfur cycle. The abundance of Sulfurovum lithotrophicum, Leptolinea tardivitalis, Desulfococcus multivorans and Aminobacterium colombiense increases when metals rise. On contrary, Bacillus stamsii, Nioella nitrareducens and Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans abundance increases when metal levels are reduced. We propose these OTUs as bacterial sentinels, whose abundance can help monitor the restoration programs of contaminated mangrove sediments in the future.

AB  - Our study aimed to determine drivers of longitudinal variation in stream metabolism and benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) composition and assess concordance of these ecological measures for two Canadian rivers (Rat River and Tobacco Creek). Gross primary production was associated with longitudinal position in both rivers but also with the percentage of the watershed used for agriculture and hydrogeomorphic zone. However, within- and among-zone differences in stream metabolism indicated that longitudinal variation followed a staircase pattern rather than a clinal pattern. BMI composition was associated with network position in both rivers, but hydrogeomorphic zones were only important in Tobacco Creek. Among-zone differences in BMI communities in Tobacco Creek depended on season. Concordance between stream metabolism and BMI composition was not observed within either river despite metabolism and BMI composition being associated with longitudinal position. For these rivers, segment-scale hydrogeomorphic conditions appear to be important modifiers of longitudinal patterns observed at the whole river scale. The lack of concordance between stream metabolism and BMI composition suggests reach-scale processes are driving ecological differences within sampling sites.

AB  - Algal biomass grown hetrotrophically in domestic wastewater was evaluated as pyrolytic feedstock for harnessing biogas, bio-oil and bio-char. Freshly harvested microalgae (MA) and lipid extracted microalgae (LEMA) were pyrolysed in packed bed reactor in the presence and absence of sand as additive. MA (without sand additive) depicted higher biogas (420 ml/g; 800 degrees C; 3 h) and bio-oil (0.70 ml/g; 500 degrees C; 3 h). Sand addition enhanced biogas production (210 ml/g; 600 degrees C; 2 h) in LEMA operation. The composition of bio-gas and bio-oil was found to depend on the nature of feedstock as well as the process conditions viz., pyrolytic-temperature, retention time and presence of additive. Sand additive improved the H-2 composition while pyrolytic temperature increment caused a decline in CO2 fraction. Bio-char productivity increased with increasing temperature specifically with LEMA. Integration of thermo-chemical process with microalgae cultivation showed to yield multiple resources and accounts for environmental sustainability in the bio-refinery framework.

AB  - The aim of this study was to test the potentials of modem analytical methods in the determination of redox properties of constructed wetland. The contents of indivi-dual oxidation states of iron in wastewater samples were determined as an indicator of the redox character of a reed-bed wastewater treatment plant in addition to monitoring their redox potentials. Fe(II) was determined by the 1,10-phenanthroline method, total iron content was determined after reduction of Fe(III) with hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Differential pulse voltammetry served as a comparative method for iron determination. The contents of sulfates, sulfides and dissolved and precipitated manganese species in wastewater samples were also determined. The presence of sulfides in samples documents reducing properties of the wetland system. Fe(III) detected in samples is the result of wetland aeration via the roots of vegetation. The aeration in the presence of redox potential gradients strongly affects the processes of wastewater treatment. The conditions and processes inside the reed bed of a constructed wetland are very difficult to study due to high heterogeneity and complexity of the system. The precise analytical methods used for real samples, with necessary modifications, may afford a tool for studying artificial and natural ecosystems.

AB  - Pentachlorophenol (PCP) has been used as a biocide and preservative for wood power poles and crossarms. If disposed in landfills, the natural capacity of landfills to transform hazardous constituents to less hazardous or inert substances may also apply to such PCP-treated materials. The principal reaction of interest in the anaerobic environment of a landfill is reductive dechlorination.
   The fate and transformation of PCP-treated wood was investigated in simulated landfill bioreactors operated under single pass leaching and leachate recirculation. The wood samples consisted of 2% of the total mass by weight loaded into the bioreactors. The PCP leaching potential was examined at varying pH conditions with TCLP and Soxhlet extractions. Adsorption of PCP to the synthetic solid waste was used to determine its role in immobilizing leachate PCP. Routine indicator parameters were used to describe the acidogenic and methanogenic phases of landfill stabilization. Leached PCP was transformed without inhibitory effects on landfill stabilization, thereby affirming the acceptability of such a codisposal practice. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Considerable and fast investments in renewable energy technologies are needed in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to achieve the Paris Agreement climate change mitigation targets. Many of these investment decisions are made at the territorial level, especially those related to the heating sector. When choosing the most suitable energy investments, decision makers need to consider several performance indicators-economic, social and environmental-simultaneously. In addition, decision makers face profound uncertainty concerning the future, as decisions on energy systems are always long-term investments. We aim to provide territorial decision makers with a simple decision-making framework that combines a robust decision-making method with multi criteria analysis and allows the inclusion of territorial features. The main aim is to develope a simple tool that provides data to seek robust solutions which will perform well over a wide range of plausible futures. The method proposed is illustrated with a case study on renewable heating solutions based in France. Heat pumps or central biomass plants are robust in various future conditions, while current domestic natural gas based heating performs badly compared to the renewable technologies.

AB  - In the process of implementing a construction project, it is necessary to meet numerous requirements imposed on investors by regulations related to broadly understood environmental protection, which are significant for the vast majority of investment processes. For obvious reasons, the environment, understood as all natural elements, is not subject to geopolitical division principles. Therefore, the issue of international cooperation between states in the field of environmental protection is becoming increasingly important. One of its major tools is the procedure for transboundary environmental impact assessment in the Polish legal order. The article presents regulations applying to the strategic environmental impact assessment and verification of the environmental effects of project implementation. The complex nature of the indicated regulations, as well as their nonuniform application by entities issuing administrative decisions may directly contribute not only to delays in implementing an investment project, but also to a significant increase in its costs. It should also be remembered that strict compliance with these requirements is a necessary condition for the participation of Community funds in the implementation of a specific project.

AB  - The main objectives of this work are the development of methodological instruments for choosing a strategy to ensure the sustainable development of the region. This is a study of methods of survey and in-depth interviews. Methodological instruments have been developed to select the region's sustainable development strategy in the context of decentralization. The level of financial stability is determined by the integral indicator using multiple regression modeling. The risk of reducing the sustainable development of the region is calculated by identifying credit, political, general economic, sociodemographic, natural-environmental and investment risks by determining the values of losses and the likelihood of risk, followed by making a risk map. It has been suggested selecting the strategy for ensuring the sustainable development of the region on the basis of a matrix that includes the values of the integral indicator of financial stability and the index of risk of losing the sustainable development of the region. With the use of theses methodological instruments, a strategy was chosen to ensure the sustainable development of the region in emergency conditions using the example of a part of the Donetsk region.

AB  - Background: The provincial wildlife management agency, British Columbia Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development, performed a translocation to control the urban mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus, uMD) overpopulation and supplement the declining non-urban mule deer (nuMD) population in the Kootenay region, British Columbia, Canada. The objectives of this cross-sectional study were to evaluate the health of the urban and nuMD populations by comparing pathogen exposure, body condition scores (BCS) and pregnancy rates, to characterize the health risks associated with the translocation and to investigate the role of infectious diseases in the decline of the nuMD deer population.
   Methods: Two hundred free-ranging mule deer were captured in urban and nonurban environments in the Kootenay region from 2014 to 2017. BCS and morphometric examinations were performed for each deer. Blood samples collected from each deer were tested for exposure to selected pathogens and pregnancy status.
   Results: Body condition scores averaged 3.4 on a five-point scale, was greater in nuMD, and significantly differed between years. Antibodies were detected for adenovirus hemorrhagic disease virus (38.4% (uMD 43.7%, nuMD 33.3%)), bluetongue virus (0.6% (uMD 1.2%, nuMD 0%)), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (8.4% (uMD 4.6%, nuMD 12.1%)), bovine viral diarrhea virus (1.1% (uMD 0%, nuMD 2.2%)), bovine parainfluenza-3 virus (27.0% (uMD 27.6%, nuMD 26.4%)), Neospora caninum (22.1% (uMD 24.4%, nuMD 19.7%)) and Toxoplasma gondii (8.2% (uMD 12.3%, nuMD 3.9%)). No antibodies against epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus were detected. Pregnancy rates did not differ between the two deer populations (90.7% (uMD 90.6%, nuMD 90.9%)). Exposure to N. caninum was associated with a reduced probability of being pregnant. uMD were more likely to be exposed to T gondii than nuMD.
   Discussion: Comparison of BCS, pregnancy rates and pathogen exposure of uMD and nuMD showed that the health of the two populations did not significantly differ, suggesting uMD translocations do not pose a severe risk of pathogen transmission between mule deer populations and that these selected pathogens do not factor in the decline of the nuMD population. However, inclusion of additional health indicators and creation of a robust predictive disease model are warranted to further characterize the health of mule deer and the health risks associated with uMD translocations. These results should be considered as part of a formal risk assessment for future uMD translocations in southeastern British Columbia.

AB  - The dissolved organic compounds found in seawater offer an indication of biogeochemical processes and anthropogenic influence in the light of their concentrations and behavior associated with different oceanic areas River inputs contribute with organic loads to seawater according to the level of natural and urban influence. A dilution of this material is expected toward ocean Around oceainc islands, the quantity of organic matter results from the life cycle of marine organisms and from human occupation The ratios of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) and the association with dissolved oxygen can be used to evaluate the environmental conditions in terms of natural and anthropogenic impacts Available information about the essential dissolved organic compounds (C, N and P) m seawater is rare This study seeks to encourage the use of dissolved organic compounds in environmental impact assessment in coastal areas of Brazil The spatial distribution of DOC, DON, DOP and urea was analyzed in four regions Itamaraca (ITA), Recife Inner Shelf (RIS), Fernando de Noronha Island (FN) and Recife Harbor (RH), all in pernambuco State - Brazil. In the case of DOC, the values obtained varied from 51.60 mu mol L -1 (0.62 mg L-1) to 358.47 mu mol L-1(4.30 mg L-1), DOP values varied from 0.01 to 2.16 mu mol L-1,both presenting their highest values in RH, the most mtensely urbanized area. In relation to DON, an extremely high value 92.89 mu mol L-1 with urea reaching 12 mu mol L-1 ,both in RH, reflects organic and sanitary discharge. Sometimes the urea concentration was associated with precarious sewage treatment combined with tourist activity, as m the case of FN. No significant spatial variation was observed for DOP taking mto account all the stations and regions, and the values presented a greater range of variation in FN The DOC: DON ratios were higher than 7 (2-4 times the Redfield ratio) and revealed the quality of the organic matter and the importance of the local process of remineralizafion, confirming that the N-limitafion enhanced the use of organic forms, mainly on FN The preserved oligotrophic conditions of the RIS, Itamaraca and FN were observed in relation to dissolved organic compounds (C, N, P), but, as regards FN, effective monitoring actions are advisable as it is a pnstme area.

AB  - The Corallinales of the Aegean coasts of Turkey have been relatively little studied, from both the floristic and the ecological point of view. The Turkish coasts offer a wide variety of environmental conditions, and the present study identifies and characterizes not only the presence or absence of these species, but also assesses their value as bioindicators. Qualitative collection of Corallinales was performed at 14 sites in a bathymetric range froth 2 to 5 m depth, where, at the same stations, the main environmental variables were recorded. The subsequent data analysis proceeds in the following three-phase procedure: i) identification of well-characterized sample groups with regards to the ecological factors mostly influencing their floristic composition; ii) identification of ecological species groups on the basis of their frequency in the sample groups; iii) ecological gradient analysis based on a reciprocal ordering method. From an ecological viewpoint, the bioindicator value of Corallinales was shown by the fuzzy c-means clustering data analyses. These species of Corallinales seems to be linked to two main environmental factors: salinity and temperature.

AB  - Background Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is commonly used in the treatment of dermatological conditions such as psoriasis. It is known that high levels of exposure to UV radiation (UVR) will increase the risk of adverse biological effects. Exposure limit values for UVR have been developed by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and occupational exposure to phototherapy staff should be kept within these limits. The use of environmental controls such as warning signs, good ventilation and UV-opaque curtains will significantly reduce the risks to staff, patients and members of the public.
   Aims The aim of the study is to identify hazards in phototherapy centres and present recommendations for reducing risks.
   Methods An environmental risk assessment has been carried out at eleven phototherapy centres in the Republic of Ireland. The study assessed a number of areas such as patient safety, staff safety, room design and UV leakage measurements.
   Results The majority of clinics are well designed and there is consistent use of protective equipment.
   Conclusions The results show that on the whole there is a satisfactory level of risk management in phototherapy centres. Recommendations on maintaining good safety standards are presented.

AB  - THE extent of degradation of natural organic mixtures largely determines their utility as records of depositional history, and their potential to act as nutritional substrates and fossil fuel sources. The degree of decomposition is usually inferred from the physical setting of the deposits(1) or from bulk chemical composition(2), but in both these cases the interpretation can bk obscured by several factors(3). We report here a study of aldoses and amino acids in samples collected from a variety of marine depositional environments and representing widely different stages of alteration. We identify consistent trends in three compositional characteristics: the percentage of organic carbon in the form of aldoses and protein amino acids, the percentage of total nitrogen present as protein amino acids, and the percentage of total amino acids present as beta-alanine and gamma-aminobutyric acid. Each of these parameters is sensitive to a different stage of alteration, and they appear to be uncompromised by source variations. Applied together, they offer concordant information on the relative diagenetic stage and reaction potential of natural organic mixtures under both aerobic and anaerobic depositional conditions.

AB  - The aim of the article. The article is aimed at identification of the relationships between the level of country's economic development and the level of its innovation activity. To achieve the aim, the authors have analyzed the key factors that influence the ability to put in place the innovations in a particular economy.
   Research methodology. The research was conducted using the materials of international analytical reports and data of Ukrainian NGO "World Data Center for Geoinformatics and Sustainable Development". The research methodology includes general scientific and special methods that are as follows: synthesis and analysis, logical generalization, systematization, comparison (these methods were used for grouping of countries and generalization of their economic development); statistical methods, such as correlation and regression analysis, analysis of the dynamics (these methods were used to describe the relationships between the macroeconomic indicators and the level of innovation activity); graphical method (w used for visualization of the obtained results).
   The results of the analysis. This article highlights the results of statistical estimation of functioning of several countries that are divided into four groups: Scandinavian countries, countries of Western Europe, Asian countries, and post socialistic countries. The certain economy was selected and included into particular group based on its position in the international ratings, and geographical location. For each group of countries, the analysis of correlation of the macroeconomic infrastructure, the degree of economic freedom and innovation activity level was completed. According to the obtained results, the nature of the relationships between the selected indicators varies by groups. In Scandinavian and Asian countries, the relationship between the level of macroeconomic infrastructure, the degree of economic freedom, and innovation activity are direct and tight. In Western Europe, the impact of the economic freedom on the innovation activity is reasonably low, and the influence of the macroeconomic infrastructure is significant. Authors describe the specific relationships of mentioned indicators in a group of post socialistic states, according to which Bulgaria and Ukraine differ significantly from Poland and the rest of the total sample, as the economic conditions of these countries and their innovation activity are in inverse dependence.
   Conclusions and directions of further researches. A quantitative description of the influence of key factors on the level of countries' innovation activity is carried out. For most countries, the direct polynomial dependencies is identified. The authors claim that for post-socialist countries, the specific conditions for the innovative activity formation are typical, and the deterioration of their economic conditions is a ground for intensification of innovation activity. The obtained results may be used as an element of further methodical providing of forecasting the innovation potential of countries that function in the conditions of economic turbulence. One of the promising area for further studies is the development of a strategy for enhancing countries' innovation activity taking into account scientific statements of sustainable development concept.

AB  - Ensuring biodiversity, through the conservation of natural habitats, such as wetlands, and of their wild flora and fauna, is the main objective of the Habitat and Species Directive 92/43/EC. Within this framework, two species of Community interest, Pomatoschistus canestrinii and Knipowitschia panizzae (Gobiidae, Osteichthyes), endemisms of the Northern Adriatic lagoons, were considered. The population structure, reproductive effort, somatic growth and production of such species were investigated in marsh habitats of the Venice lagoon, as indicators of the status of the populations and their habitats. The lagoon marsh habitats hosted abundant and well structured populations, functioning also as breeding areas for these species. A certain spatial variability was also observed, possibly related to the shelter conditions of different marsh sub-habitats (e.g. marsh creeks vs. adjacent mudflats). These results were discussed in the light of the available ecological knowledge on the two species, with a particular attention to the conservation priority focused on the protection of biodiversity and of key habitats.

AB  - We analyzed data from coastal wetlands across the Laurentian Great Lakes to identify fish assemblage patterns and relationships to habitat, watershed condition, and regional setting. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination of electrofishing catch-per-effort data revealed an overriding geographic and anthropogenic stressor gradient that appeared to structure fish composition via impacts on water clarity and vegetation structure. Wetlands in Lakes Erie and Michigan with agricultural watersheds, turbid water, little submerged vegetation, and a preponderance of generalist, tolerant fishes occupied one end of this gradient, while wetlands in Lake Superior with largely natural watersheds, clear water, abundant submerged vegetation, and diverse fishes occupied the other. Fish composition was also related to wetland morphology, hydrology, exposure, and substrate, but this was only evident within low-disturbance wetlands. Anthropogenic stress appears to homogenize fish composition among wetlands and mask other fish-habitat associations. Because land use is strongly spatially patterned across the Great Lakes and aquatic vegetation is a key habitat element that responds to both biogeography and disturbance, it is difficult to disentangle natural from anthropogenic drivers of coastal wetland fish composition.

AB  - Background: Most studies on tropical bryophytes deal with epiphytic species. This is the first ecological study of tropical forests that focuses specifically on terrestrial bryophytes.
   Aim: To investigate the differences between slope and ridge environments in upper montane forests of southern Ecuador in terms of species diversity (richness, abundance), species composition and life forms of terrestrial bryophytes.
   Methods: We used Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) to group bryophyte releves by study location, habitat type and exposure class. Species indicator values were calculated and compared for different habitats.
   Results: In total, 140 species were recorded, the majority being liverworts. NMDS analyses and Mantel correlations clearly separated between slope and ridge releves, and between sunny and shaded microhabitats on ridges. Bryophyte life forms also showed different distribution patterns in slope and in ridge habitats. Mosses were more prominent in sunny than in shaded microhabitats.
   Conclusions: Environmental differentiation between ridges and slopes, and small-scale variation in microclimatic conditions caused by differences in exposure, were stronger predictors of species richness and composition than geographical distance between study sites.

AB  - Fish species inhabiting the Barents Sea display great seasonal and inter-annual variation in abundance and distribution. This study describes the assemblages and distributions of fish species in the southwestern and central part of the Barents Sea, which includes the polar front. The area has an unpredictable environment due to variable inflow of Atlantic water and fish species composition differs between Arctic and Atlantic water masses. Assemblages can be identified as distinct groups corresponding to different environmental conditions. In the period 1997-1999, 57 fish species and shrimp were identified and 29 species/species groups were used in the statistical analyses. Cluster and correspondence analyses showed that the fish community consists of four assemblages: a northern, a southern, a deep and a central group. Temperature explained 26.2% of the variation in the species data, and depth 14.5% of the variation. The assemblages are coherent with previous zoogeographical studies from the Barents Sea. To reduce research costs, one might monitor indicator species characteristic for the identified fish assemblages. Fish assemblages may be a good tool when studying ecosystem responses to fishery and marine climate change.

AB  - Soils store 80% of global terrestrial organic carbon and alterations in fluxes into and out of this pool may interact with ongoing climate change. Belowground food webs drive soil C dynamics, but little is known about their responses to co-occurring global change agents. We investigated open-air experimental grassland communities at ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, ambient and enriched nitrogen input, and ambient and reduced summer precipitation to evaluate how these agents interactively affect soil nematodes, which are often used as an indicator group for soil food web structure and soil health. The aim of the study was to elucidate the response of the functional diversity of soil nematodes to changing environmental conditions by using nematode functional guilds and indices as indicators.
   The results suggest that nematode functional guilds surpass nematode trophic groups as soil indicators, suggesting that more detailed data on nematode community structure is essential to capture functional changes in response to environmental change. For instance, the density of opportunistic fungal feeders increased due to N addition with the response being more pronounced at elevated CO2, whereas densities of sensitive fungal-feeders were increased at ambient N and elevated CO2, illustrating opposing responses within one trophic group. Opportunistic bacterial feeders increased at elevated N, but did not respond to other environmental factors studied. Root-feeding Longidoridae were significantly reduced at elevated CO2 and elevated N compared to ambient conditions, whereas other plant feeders were little affected by the manipulations. Predacious nematodes were less abundant at elevated N, and the Structure Index (which indicates food web structure) suggested reduced top-down forces and simplified soil food webs, although omnivores did not vary significantly. Elevated CO2 buffered the effect of reduced precipitation on the Enrichment Index (which indicates increased resource availability) and the Channel Index (which indicates changes in decomposition channel) probably due to reduced stomatal conductance at elevated CO2. Further, the results suggest that the decomposer community switched from a bacterial-dominated to a fungal-dominated system at elevated N, indicating shifts in the microbial community as well as in the functioning of belowground food webs. Overall, the studied global change agents interactively and differentially affected functional guilds of soil nematodes, suggesting complex changes in soil processes. We highlight that detailed information on the functional guilds of nematodes is likely necessary to fully understand alterations in soil food webs and related processes due to global environmental change.

AB  - Delineation of stratigraphic sequences and their component systems tracts in mudrock-dominated facies is generally difficult due to the relatively homogenous, fine-grained nature of the strata. In this study, we apply a multi-proxy analytical approach to a thick Devonian mudrock-dominated succession through detailed analysis of sedimentologic, paleobiologic, and geochemical data through 600 m of mudrock-rich facies. Varied combinations of proxies prove to be most useful in delineating sequence development in anoxic-. dysoxic-, and oxic-dominated mudrock settings, and in mixed mudrock-carbonate and mixed mudrock-sandstone successions. These interpretations are tested against an established sequence stratigraphic framework for 11 Middle to Upper Devonian (mid-Eifelian to lower Famennian) sequences in the Appalachian Basin. The sequences presented here further detail and refine global Devonian T-R cycles Id to Ile of the well known Johnson, Sandberg and Klapper sea-level curve.
   The usefulness of proxies in delineating depositional sequences and systems tracts varies dependent on depositional, paleoceanographic, paleoecologic, and early diagenetic conditions. Those proxies that show a range of variations in specific settings, such as grain size, degree of bioturbation, and concentrations of TOC and elements/elemental ratios (e.g., CaCO3, Al, Ti, Mg, Sc, Si, Mo, Ni, V; Si/Al and Ti/Al) may help delineate depositional dynamics related to redox conditions, condensation, dilution, and clastic, biologic, and/or authigenic sediment sources.
   In fine-grained, anoxic-dominated facies, interpreted to represent basinal settings, sequences and systems tracts are best delineated by anoxic-related proxies TOC and Mo. In intermediate, dysoxic-dominated settings, TOC. Mo, bioturbation, and Al remain effective indicators of sequence development. In relatively oxygenated, mudrock-rich and carbonate poor sequences, bioturbation may function as the most effective proxy for recognizing systems tracts.
   For mixed fine-grained siliciclastic-carbonate successions, concentration and type of CaCO3 (e.g., benthic macroskeletal, pelagic styliolinid/dacryoconarid, and micritic/calcisilt) are useful in identifying position within cycles. In more proximal, carbonate-poor successions, fine- and coarse-grained fractions become increasingly differentiated; these can be distinguished by relatively high Si/Al ratios (Si/Al >= ca. 5). Elemental ratios indicative of coarser clastic input (e.g., Si/Al Zr/Al and Ti/Al) are applicable to identifying position with a sequence, but they may also be affected by input from eolian, volcanogenic, or biogenic sources. In addition, fluxes of siliciclastic, carbonate, and TOC sediment types may dilute the concentration of the others. Multiple lines of evidence should be examined in interpreting relative depth and position within a sequence. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The characteristics of evapotranspiration and canopy surface conductance of winter wheat have been measured and analysed by using the Bowen ratio-energy balance (BREB) method. In order to understand better the effect of soil water status on evapotranspiration and conductance of wheat, the daily and seasonal variations of leaf stomatal resistance under different soil water conditions have also been monitored and analysed. The experiments have been carried out at Luancheng Experimental Station of Agro-ecosystem (LESA), Heibei, People's Republic of China. During the growing seasons after turning to green, most of the available energy (Rn - G) of the wheat field is partitioned into latent heat. In the daily course, generally, the Bowen ratio (H/LE) for winter wheat is less than one-third; sometimes, it can reach a value of around 0.4. The seasonal trend of LE/Rn shows a parabola curve. The ratio of LE/Rn varies from 71 to 93%, with the peak occurring in the blooming stage. G/Rn shows a declining logarithmic trend during the observation period, and reaches its minimum value of around 6-8% after blooming. According to the BREB method, the daily mean evapotranspiration rate from jointing to maturity is 3.9 turn day(-1), which is very close to the value 4.1 turn derived from the water balance equation. The daily average value for canopy conductance g(c) is about 7.8 mm s(-1). Seasonal trend of leaf stomatal resistance shows that the stomatal resistance in blooming and milking are lower than that in other growing stages. This is possibly determined by the characteristic of water requirement of winter wheat. The stomatal conductance is strongly dependent on soil water status in natural conditions. When the extractable soil water content (ESW) of the 0-40 cm layer is less than 50%, the leaf stomatal conductance g(st) is linearly dependent on ESW, whereas there is no relation between ESW and g(st) when ESW is more than 50%. Therefore, the ESW of 50% can be considered as a threshold value of extractable soil water content for controlling the leaf stornatal conductance, or as an indicator of incipient stornatal closure. The slope of the g(st)-ESW line varies through the growing stages, with the largest slope occurring in the milking stage. Based on the analysis of g(st)-ESW relations, we construct a simple but realistic model of stornatal conductance-soil moisture relations. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Climate change is likely to result in novel conditions with no analogy to current climate. Therefore, the application of species distribution models (SDMs) based on the correlation between observed species' occurrence and their environment is questionable and calls for a better understanding of the traits that determine species occurrence. Here, we compared two intraspecific, trait-based SDMs with occurrence-based SDMs, all developed from European data, and analyzed their transferability to the native range of Douglas-fir in North America. With data from 50 provenance trials of Douglas-fir in central Europe multivariate universal response functions (URFs) were developed for two functional traits (dominant tree height and basal area) which are good indicators of growth and vitality under given environmental conditions. These trials included 290 North American provenances of Douglas-fir. The URFs combine genetic effects i.e. the climate of provenance origin and environmental effects, i.e. the climate of planting locations into an integrated model to predict the respective functional trait from climate data. The URFs were applied as SDMs (URF-SDMs) by converting growth performances into occurrence. For comparison, an ensemble occurrence-based SDM was developed and block cross validated with the BIOMOD2 modeling platform utilizing the observed occurrence of Douglas-fir in Europe. The two trait based SDMs and the occurrence-based SDM, all calibrated with data from Europe, were applied to predict the known distribution of Douglas-fir in its introduced and native range in Europe and North America. Both models performed well within their calibration range in Europe, but model transfer to its native range in North America was superior in case of the URF-SDMs showing similar predictive power as SDMs developed in North America itself. The high transferability of the URF-SDMs is a testimony of their applicability under novel climatic conditions highlighting the role of intraspecific trait variation for adaptation planning in climate change.

AB  - Sheep are managed under a variety of different environments (continually outdoors, partially outdoors with seasonal or diurnal variation, continuously indoors) and for different purposes, which makes assessing welfare challenging. This diversity means that resource-based indicators are not particularly useful and, thus, a welfare assessment scheme for sheep, focusing on animal-based indicators, was developed. We focus specifically on ewes, as the most numerous group of sheep present on farm, although many of the indicators may also have relevance to adult male sheep. Using the Welfare Quality (R) framework of four Principles and 12 Criteria, we considered the validity, reliability, and feasibility of 46 putative animal-based indicators derived from the literature for these criteria. Where animal-based indicators were potentially unreliably or were not considered feasible, we also considered the resource-based indicators of access to water, stocking density, and floor slipperiness. With the exception of the criteria "Absence of prolonged thirst," we suggest at least one animal-based indicator for each welfare criterion. As a minimum, face validity was available for all indicators; however, for many, we found evidence of convergent validity and discriminant validity (e.g., lameness as measured by gait score, body condition score). The reliability of most of the physical and health measures has been tested in the field and found to be appropriate for use in welfare assessment. However, for the majority of the proposed behavioral indicators (lying synchrony, social withdrawal, postures associated with pain, vocalizations, stereotypy, vigilance, response to surprise, and human approach test), this still needs to be tested. In conclusion, the comprehensive assessment of sheep welfare through largely animal-based measures is supported by the literature through the use of indicators focusing on specific aspects of sheep biology. Further work is required for some indicators to ensure that measures are reliable when used in commercial settings.

AB  - The effects of increased temperature were tested in Amphiprion ocellaris, using a cellular diagnostics approach (in several tissues) combined with an organismal approach (body condition). Clownfish were exposed to a one month experiment following two temperature treatments: control (26 degrees C) and elevated temperature (30 degrees C). Fish were sampled at 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days for (1) assessment of stress biomarkers (catalase, lipid peroxidation, glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, acetylcholinesterase, heat shock protein 70 kDa and ubiquitin - in brain, gills, liver, intestine and muscle), (2) estimation of integrated biomarker response index based on the biomarkers tested and (3) assessment of Fulton's K index. Results show all biomarkers except acetylcholinesterase responded consistently and significantly to elevated temperature across tissue types suggesting they are suitable indicators of thermal stress in A. ocellaris. Biomarker levels were tissue-specific, and in addition, the most reactive tissues to temperature were muscle, gills and liver which suggest that highly oxygenated tissues seem to be the most responsive under thermal stress. The most responsive sampling times to increased temperature were T7 and T28: thermal stress was observed after 7 days of exposure (biomarker levels increased), then a pattern of decrease in biomarker levels towards the end of the experiment was observed, which may suggest fish were able to acclimate to exposure conditions. This indicates that A. ocellaris probably lives far from its upper thermal limit and is capable of adjusting the protein quality control system and enzymes' activities to protect cell functions under elevated temperatures. The temperature treatment did not significantly influence body condition of the animals but biomarkers were negatively correlated to wet body weight. This suggests that thermal acclimation incurs at some energetic cost. In conclusion, these results suggest that this coral reef fish species presents a significant acclimation potential under ocean warming scenarios of +4 degrees C. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of a conspecific on survival advantages in a challenged feeding environment created through restricted food availability periods. We measured the daily activity-rest pattern as the circadian response indicator, and changes in body mass and mortality as the survivorship indicator. Migratory male red-headed buntings (Emberiza bruniceps) were housed alone (single, Group 1) or with a conspecific (pair, Group 2) in activity cages that continuously recorded the activity-rest pattern. Cages were individually placed within the isolated photoperiodic boxes providing short-day conditions (8 h light: 16 h darkness, LD 8/16; L = 15 lux; D = 0.5 lux at the cage floor level) with food freely available (ad libitum). Beginning from day 11 of the experiment, food availability was restricted for two weeks to only during the 8 h daytime (zeitgeber time [ZT 0-8]; ZT 0 = time of lights-on). Thus, birds were concurrently subjected to a food zeitgeber cycle, PA 8/16, synchronous (in phase) with the LD 8/16. Thereafter, food availability was changed to only during the 16 h of darkness (ZT 8-0; ZT 8 = time of lights-off). Thus, the food cycle, PA 16/8 (16 h food present: 8 h food absent) was in conflict with the LD 8/16; the LD and PA cycles were in antiphase. This was considered for diurnal redheaded buntings as the challenged feeding environment. After four weeks, singles were returned to the ad libitum food condition; those in pairs remained on the nighttime (darkness) food regimen but were separated to confirm the effects of the nighttime food condition on isolates. The results show that the presence of a conspecific within the cage influenced the daily activity-rest pattern, maintained body mass, and reduced mortality. It is suggested that the presence of a conspecific within the same cage improved the circadian performance of the members forming the pair and enhanced their survivorship.

AB  - While fixed visual cues provide reliable reference points for navigation in static water, it remains unclear whether fish energetically benefit from their presence in flowing water. Furthermore, benefits of visual feedback from fixed sources may be less for group members that can gain additional information from others. Using an open-channel flume, this study investigated how the response of fish to stationary visual stimuli is influenced by flow and group membership under two treatments: vertical black and white stripes placed on (1) both side walls of the channel or (2) one side wall only compared to a control where both walls were uniform white. The responses were compared in flowing and static water, and between individuals and groups of five. Fish exhibited a positive affiliation for the visual cues, travelling more slowly and spending more time closer to the striped walls. Fish were more edge oriented under flowing conditions, presumably utilizing the lower velocities at the wall boundary to reduce energy expenditure. When only one wall presented visual cues, individual fish spent more time associated with it in flowing water, suggesting some energetic benefit in lotic conditions. This may result from a greater ability to maintain station or control position relative to a reference point and/or the use of visual stimuli as a proxy indicator of physical structure which may provide drag-reducing refuge. A lesser association with the striped wall in static water suggests that visual cues provide other nonhydrodynamic benefits, such as physical refuge from predators or opportunities for crypsis. Conversely, less association of shoals with the striped walls may reflect a greater dependence on information provided by conspecifics or increased security associated with being part of a group.

AB  - The development of the information sphere and the corresponding increase in its volume and cost is accompanied by the introduction of advanced information technologies in all spheres of public life of the state, which leads to an increase in the frequency of attacks and potential losses from information leakage. As a result, the complexity of protection systems and an increase in their cost. In these conditions, the task to efficiently distribute limited financial resources to protect the information of business entities becomes more and more important and largely determines the level of financial and economic security of the enterprise and the state as a whole. Of particular relevance is the development of issues of optimization of indicators of the information security system in a dynamic confrontation. Such indicators can be the amount of damage caused from the implementation of information threats, which determines the effectiveness of the protection system, the profit from making investments in information protection, their profitability, and the like. It was established that it is necessary to determine the total amount of protection resources, which minimizes the total losses from possible information leakage in conditions of instability. To determine the optimal strategy for such confrontations Gordon-Loeb model and asymmetric zero-sum game were used. The authors believe that the optimal control mechanism is the distribution of resources between objects that contain a different share of information and are distinguished by natural security, dynamic vulnerability, and the probability of an attack with the allocation of a certain amount of resources. Financial management is a complex system of knowledge about financial relations in the economic process, financial mechanism and technology of financial management of a company. The efficient creation and use of financial resources ensure the financial stability of a company and prevents its bankruptcy. The practical significance of the study lies in determining the optimal moment for the introduction of defense resources - after the direction and intensity of attacks and, accordingly, the possible level of losses was clarified.

AB  - Territorial planning is an integral part of strategic planning in accordance with the current legislation of the Russian Federation. When development strategies are elaborated, the assessment of the socio-economic situation in the region should be based on the results obtained in the course of studying the current situation in a constituent entity of the Russian Federation in comparison with its border territorial entities, as well as in comparison with indicators in the macroregion (federal district). SWOT analysis is the most common technology for assessing the situation in a region. Due to various reasons the use of this method does not provide high accuracy of the result. The use of the Zipf distribution (inversely proportional dependence) as a reference provides an opportunity for a more accurate quantitative analysis of the dynamics of indicators used to assess the socio-economic situation in territorial entities. The goal of the paper is to determine current external conditions, trends and imbalances in the socio-economic situation in a region with the use of Zipf's law. In contrast to the traditional use of the law in the study of demographic indicators, our paper aims to consider the dynamics of changes in gross regional product and in the number of jobs. The results indicate that the distribution of the value added and the distribution of number of jobs tend to an inversely proportional function. The discussion of the results is presented in the form of a discussion on the impact of socio-economic situation on the formation of long-term development plans; the discussion takes into account the positions of constituent entities of the Russian Federation on the Zipf curve. In addition, we substantiate the possibility and necessity of using the gross regional product indicator in the conditions of the Russian Federation. Our conclusions show the advantage of using distributions to study the existing external environment in a constituent entity of the Russian Federation. Practical application of Zipf's law helps define the starting conditions and forecast the consequences of implementation of socio-economic development strategies more accurately and to substantiate quantitative indicators for long-term plans.

AB  - In the past two decades, several paleobotanical studies on lakes have indicated a drier climatic condition in Amazonia during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and early-mid Holocene, which likely resulted in the contraction of the tropical forest and expansion of savanna. However, these investigations in the eastern Amazon are scarce, and the reliability and precision of the inference remains largely limited. In this study, palynological analyses were carried out in surficial sediments of Violao Lake, southeastern Amazonia, to assess the distribution and sources of pollen and spores from montane savanna and forest, based on surrounding vegetation types, catchment basin and wind patterns, and also to identify modern pollen rain characteristics of the ecosystems developed under edaphic conditions. Considering the spatial distribution of pollen and spores in the lake basin, the montane savanna pollen are predominant in the eastern and western borders and subordinate in the central portion of the lake, whereas those of forest formations are mainly present in its western margin. Pteridophytes and algae spores show a distinct surface distribution compared to montane savanna pollen, while the algae spores have a good correlation with forest formation pollen. The correlation of these data along with vegetation types of the catchment basin indicates that the absence of pollen grains from species, that present large occurrence along the catchment basin, may be partially related to phenological characteristics that avoided pollen losses. However, in general, montane savanna pollen in the bottom sediments tends to represent a signal of the regional vegetation developed over ferruginous duricrusts in the Serra do Carajas, while forest formation pollen may be used to identify changes in forest structure of the catchment basin of Violao Lake. As montane savanna is developed under edaphic conditions in hydric stress substrate, a systematic description of pollen grains clearly demonstrates that only changes in forest vegetation can be used as a reliable indicator of paleoclimate changes.

AB  - We have studied the interdependence of the intensity of oxidative processes/antioxidant level and the thyroid status parameters in a group of students aged 18-24 who lived for a long time in the territory of enhanced radioecological control (density of soil contamination by isotopes ((137)Cs3.7.10(4) - 18.5.10(4) Bq/m(2)). We examined 50 people from relatively environmentally friendly areas (control group) and 50 people from IV radiation zone (experimental group). In the experimental group, there were no individuals with clinical manifestations of thyroid pathology. However, subgroups with signs of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism were identified. We evaluated the level of cortisol, thyrotrophic hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T-3), thyroxine (T-4), malonic dialdehyde (MDA), ceruloplasmin (CP), transferrin (Tf), sulfhydryl groups (SH); we calculated the oxidative stress index (OSI). The research was conducted one month before the examination time and also during the exams as a factor in increased emotional stress. A lowered CP level was found in the subgroup with signs of hypothyroidism; SH groups - in all subgroups, separated by thyroid status. The oxidative stress index was higher in all students examined of the experimental group, compared with the control. The growth of MDA level is marked in the experimental group - it is the most strongly pronounced in conditions of additional emotional load in people with signs of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. CP level significantly decreased in the subgroup of hyperthyroidism on the background of T-3 decrease. OSI increased in all students examined from the experimental group. In the subgroup of hypothyroidism it became significantly higher than in the subgroup of euthyroidism. A positive correlation between the levels of CP and T-3 was found. The highest values of the correlation coefficients were noted for subgroups with signs of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, with the coefficient significance increasing under conditions of emotional stress. The index of oxidative stress in the experimental group positively correlated with the level of TSH - in terms of emotional stress, the statistical significance of the coefficients disappeared. In the subgroups divided by thyroid status, variability of interactions between OSI and T3 was observed but it was not statistically significant. It was found that the participation of thyroid status in supporting redox homeostasis in people aged 18-24 who suffered from chronic small-doze radiation exposure was realized mainly by the influence on the antioxidant system. The ability of thyroid hormones to maintain a proper antioxidant state was suppressed in this group. The unbalanced relationship between thyroid hormones and oxidative stress indicators is strongly manifested under conditions of additional emotional stress.

AB  - Fluctuating Asymmetry (FA) in morphology is used as a proxy for developmental instability in response to stress factors. FA has important implications for understanding the impact of differential environments and stressors on the skeletal phenotype. Here, we explore FA in the mandibular morphology of wild and captive Macaca fuscata to detect differences induced by the captive environment. We use two different approaches in Geometric Morphometrics to characterise the degree and patterns of FA and Directional Asymmetry (DA) based on 3D mandibular landmarks. Our results show that the wild and captive groups exhibit morphological dissimilarities in the symmetric component of shape while no significant degree of asymmetry (fluctuating or directional) was detected. Based on our results and on previous literature on the subject, we suggest that (I) captivity is likely to affect the mandibular morphology of M. fuscata; (II) FA may not be a suitable indicator to detect stress in the conditions analysed; and that (III) the mandible may not be the ideal region to study asymmetry because of its functional nature.

AB  - In the Message of the President to the people of the Republic of Kazakhstan N. A. Nazarbayev "the Third modernization of Kazakhstan: global from January 2017, it is said "the agro-industrial complex of Kazakhstan has a promising future", "we will help to be one of the largest producers of agricultural export products" [1]. Kazakhstan ranks sixth in the world in terms of its grass resources. Pasture land is 189 0 million hectares, historically being the driving force in the country's economy, as a source of feed resources for the development of livestock [2]. According to the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan, there are 27 1 million hectares of pastures that were shot down in an average and severe degree. In the zonal aspect, the destruction of pasture ecosystems is mostly observed in the flat part, where more than 95% of all downed pastures are located, including the desert and semi desert zones-16.1 million hectares or 60% of their area.
   Downed pastures are the main consequence of changing environmental conditions and irrational human economic activity. It is manifested in the loss of valuable forage plant species from the herbage and their replacement with weeds, non-edible and annual species [3,4].

AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of extensive grazingin a sown pasture with forestland on the health of beef cows by measuring multiple indicators. Ten Japanese Black beef cows were used in this experiment. Five of the ten cows were grazed for two months on a 1.8 ha field. The remaining cows were fed under confinement conditions. Behavioral assessments showed that grazing increased sternum lying with rumination of the cows. The grazing cows did not show any abnormal behaviors. There was a tendency for the numbers of red blood cells and lymphocytes to be lower in grazing cows than in confined cows, whereas the number of neutrophils in grazing cows was significantly higher than that in confined cows. In addition, grazing cows had a higher total antioxidant capacity and glutathione peroxidase activity than confined cows. These results suggest that extensive grazing in a sown pasture with forestland increases natural behaviors, decreases circulating red blood cells and lymphocytes and enhances neutrophil circulation, antioxidant enzyme activity, and antioxidant capacity.

AB  - Mining companies are expected to return land to a stable, productive, and self-sustaining condition by rehabilitating degraded areas to also deliver social benefits, an essential dimension of sustainable land management. This research aimed to develop a framework for mine rehabilitation planning based on an integrated analysis of the social-ecological system provided by the ecosystem services concept to facilitate community engagement and the delivery of social benefits. An Ecosystem Services Assessment for Rehabilitation framework was tested at two bauxite mines undergoing ecological restoration. The mines are operated by the same company in two countries. Key results showed that the framework can help companies, regulators, and community members alike identify whether biophysical restoration efforts translate into key human benefits. Overall the framework provides a means for enhancing community engagement to explicitly address social benefits that, with a business as usual focus on ecological goals, may not be delivered. The ecosystem services concept provides a practical approach to link ecological and social outcomes of mine restoration.

AB  - Biochemical composition of phytoplankton is a key indicator of the physiological and nutritional status of phytoplankton. A balanced biochemical pattern represents a healthy and productive metabolism in the autotrophic levels which can facilitate proper functioning of higher level organisms. The estimation of biochemical compositions was initiated in the early 1970's. However, there has been a significant set of modifications in the extraction method and improvements in the sampling and analysis techniques since then. Similarly, the extent of biochemical measurements from various aquatic ecosystems around the globe has also increased. Recently, biochemical patterns are being used as a tool to track the changes in the physiological status of phytoplankton as a response to climate change. Such investigations are also forming part of research works on marine food webs and the nutritional status of ecosystems. This article is a brief review of research works carried out so far in an attempt to understand the biochemical compositions of phytoplankton in the global oceans and the implications with regard to changing environmental conditions.

AB  - This study aimed to assess ecological quality status of hard substratum macroinvertebrates communities of the Caspian Sea with three ecological indices and their relationship with environmental factors. For this purpose, benthic communities of the Caspian Sea basin were studied seasonally during 2014 in 8 sampling sites. Temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, nitrate, nitrite, silicate and phosphate were measured as environmental factors. The benthic classification indices AMBI (AZTI Marine Biotic Index), M-AMBI (Multivariate AMBI) and BENTIX (BENthic IndeX) were applied to assess the ecological status of the studied area. Results showed low dissimilarity based on species composition and abundance among seasons, while all seasons discriminated clearly based on environmental factors. In addition, AMBI index was more successful to assess ecological health of hard substratum in the Caspian Sea basin than M-AMBI and BENTIX. Furthermore, AMBI showed high sensitivity to environmental variation. Results indicated that temperature, nitrate, silicate, phosphate and nitrite were the most important factors in the composition and abundance fluctuation of hard substratum macroinvertebrates communities, respectively.

AB  - The concept of Ecological Potential was explored using the macrobenthic communities of the Mondego estuary (Portugal). Different scenarios (loss of a primary producer and intertidal habitat, and habitat modification due to hydromorphological changes and continued press perturbation) were tested to predict changes in the biology if hydromorphological pressures could be reversed, assuming that differences with and without the pressure could indicate the potential.
   Results showed noticeable changes in the system biology in each scenario. The approach followed, indicates that when data sets exist, differences in the measurement of ecological status with and without the hydromorphological change could be a way forward to determine the potential. In the particular case of the Mondego estuary, the South arm (physically unaltered water body) proved to be richer than the North (HMWB). For the Ecological Potential determination, the South arm could thus be used to derive and adjust future reference conditions for the North. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Seabird abundances and breeding distribution have the potential to serve as ecological indicators. The western Antarctic Peninsula is one of the three sites in the world with the greatest increases in local temperature during the last 50 years. The aim of this study was to monitor the distribution and abundance of breeding populations of seabirds in the northern sector of the Danco Coast, north-west of the Antarctic Peninsula, during the breeding season 2010/11. The birds were the Wilson's storm petrel (Oceanites oceanicus), South Polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki), kelp gull (Larus dominicanus), Antarctic tern (Sterna vittata), snowy sheathbill (Chionis alba), chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica), southern giant petrel (Macronectes giganteus), gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua), Cape petrel (Daption capense) and Antarctic shag (Phalacrocorax bransfieldensis). Annual breeding population growth increased in pygoscelids, southern giant petrel and sheathbill, and for the remaining species, breeding population trends were stable. Given that seabird populations can provide valuable information on the conditions of their feeding and nesting environments, this study highlights the need to maintain basics monitoring studies.

AB  - The majority of ecotoxicological enclosure experiments monitor species abundances at different chemical concentrations. Here, we present a new modelling approach that estimates changes in food web flows from such data and show that population- and food web level effects are revealed that are not apparent from abundance data alone. For the case of cypermethrin in freshwater enclosures, photosynthesis and excretion (d(-1)) of phytoplankton at 3.643 mu g L-1 cypermethrin were 30% lower and 100% higher than in the control, respectively. The ingestion rate of mesozooplankton (d(-1)) was 6 times higher in the treated enclosures than in the control as food concentration increased with insecticide exposure. With increasing cypermethrin concentrations, nanoflagellates progressively relied on phytoplankton as their main food source, which rendered the food web less stable. We conclude that this tool has excellent potential to analyse the wealth of enclosure data as it only needs species abundance and general constraints. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Selective mortality within a population, based on the phenotype of individuals, is the foundation of the theory of natural selection. We examined temperature-induced shifts in the relationships among early life history traits and survivorship over the embryonic and larval stages of a tropical damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis. Our experiments show that temperature determines the intensity of selective mortality, and that this changes with ontogeny. The size of energy stores determined survival through to hatching, after which egg size became a good indicator of fitness as predicted by theoretical models. Yet, the benefits associated with egg size were not uniform among test temperatures. Initial egg size positively influenced larval survival at control temperature (29 degrees C). However, this embryonic trait had no effect on post-hatching longevity of individuals reared at the higher (31 degrees C) and lower (25 degrees C) end of the temperature range. Overall, our findings indicate that the outcome of selective mortality is strongly dependent on the interaction between environment conditions and intrinsic developmental schedules.

AB  - BV using pitfall traps and with special emphasis on the geographical distribution and the relationships of abundance of the Tenebrionidae assemblage, the taxonomic composition and the patterns of abundance (denso-activity) of the Arthropoda inhabiting the transect 27-30 degrees S of the chilean transitional coastal-desert were examined. Five orders numerically dominated the Arthropoda assemblage. These were Coleoptera, Diptera, Psocoptera, Collembola and Hymenoptera. Tenebrionidae, represented by 14 genera, was the most diverse and abundant family of the epigean arthropod-fauna. Gyriosomus Guerin-Meneville, 1834 was the most specious genus ill that family. Some of its species showed a narrow distribution in the study area, and may be indicators of endemisms. The species richness of Tenebrionidae did not follow the latitudinal pluviometric pattern of the transect. Carrizal Bajo, a site with xeric conditions, provided a higher number than expected. in accordance with the pattern shown by the flora, mainly geophytes and hemicryptophytes.

AB  - This study extends the investigations of Norton and Mason (2003), who used empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of the California commercial fish and invertebrate landings data (CACom database) to find two patterns of variability (EOF1 and EOF2) that describe major changes in species composition from 1930 through 2000. Temporal variations in EOF1 and EOF2 are closely correlated to climate-scale physical processes of the equatorial Pacific (remote) and the North Pacific (local) atmosphere and oceans, respectively. These findings suggest that changes in species composition of California landings begin as remote and local physical processes that are transmitted through the ecosystem to target species. Log(e)-transformed sardine landings history is similar to the time variations in EOF1. As fish and invertebrate resources become fully utilized, variations in their landings become better indicators of environmental climate change off California; however, conservative resource management and fluctuating market demand may disrupt this close relationship. Consistent temporal associations of species groups with recurrent physical environmental conditions may allow timely detection of climate changes and thereby provide opportunities for proactive ecosystem management.

AB  - Body size and body mass are key indicators of individual phenotypic quality and predictors of important lifehistory traits such as survival and reproductive success. In wild herbivores, individual responses to changing environmental conditions influence morphometric traits over temporal scales and between populations. However, little research has assessed joint effects of weather and land use on body size/mass at finer, intra-population scale. We used data collected on female and juvenile red deer Cervus elaphus shot over a 17-year period (2001-2017) along two sides of a mountainous ridge largely differing in land cover and habitat productivity, to investigate how fine-scale land use patterns and weather influenced multiple morphometric indicators of phenotypic quality. Accounting for weather, body mass of all sex/age classes increased with increasing proportion of cultivated areas in the landscape and, for young females and calves, that increase was stronger or occurred only in the "low-quality" site. Other biometric traits such as mandible length and hind foot length showed the same pattern in young and calves, suggesting that body mass/size reflects individual responses especially in the early life-stage. Accounting for land use, body mass of adult females and calves was enhanced by increasing rainfall and decreasing temperature in spring-summer, i.e. favourable conditions for vegetation growth. This result also supports late gestation- and lactation-mediated effects of vegetation productivity on offspring quality. Additionally, in male calves, body mass and several other traits increased with decreasing severity of the previous winter, suggesting that quality of male offspring - but not that of females - could depend on winter conditions experienced in utero, likely due to higher maternal costs. Our findings emphasise how land cover and weather jointly affect indicators of phenotypic quality in a large mammal, helping to predict size responses of herbivores under the ongoing climatic- and anthropogenic land use-changes.

AB  - Isatis indigotica Fortune is a popular herb in traditional Chinese medicine, and various types of metabolites are the basis for its pharmacological efficacy. The biosynthesis and accumulation of these metabolites are closely linked to nitrogen availability; the benefits of low nitrogen application on the environment and herb quality are increasingly prominent. To analyze metabolic changes in the leaves and roots of I.indigotica in nitrogen deficiency conditions, and to identify the pathways and metabolites induced by low nitrogen availability, we used untargeted liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UHPLC-TripleTOF) to obtain metabolomics profiling of I.indigotica under two N-deficiency treatments (0 kg/hm(2); 337.5 kg/hm(2)) and normal nitrogen treatment (675 kg/hm(2)). A total of 447 metabolites were annotated. Principal component analysis separated the three nitrogen treatments. A greater diversity of metabolites was observed in roots than in leaves under N-deficiency treatments, suggesting that roots have a more important function in low N tolerance. Differential metabolites were mainly enriched in purine metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, the shikimate pathway, tryptophan metabolism, and flavonoid biosynthesis that notably induced only in leaves in low nitrogen stress. Moderate N-deficiency benefits carbohydrate accumulation, whereas accumulation of most amino acids decreases. Uniquely, L-tryptophan was maintained at a high concentration in N-deficiency conditions. Low nitrogen stress induced the accumulation of some specialized metabolites (matairesinol, dictamnine, 5-hydroxyindoleacetate (serotonin) in roots and vitexin, xanthohumol, sinapyl alcohol in leaves). N-deficiency also increased the accumulation of adenosine and quality indicators of I.indigotica (indirubin-indigo, epigoitrin and anthranilic acid) in a certain degree. Our findings showed that nitrogen deficiency modified roots and leaves conditions of I.indigotica, affecting both the primary and secondary metabolism. Moderate nitrogen reduction was beneficial to the accumulation of active ingredients. Our methods and analysis are expected to provide an insight regarding the diversity of metabolites and regulation of their synthesis in low nitrogen application, and better investigate the nitrogen deficiency effect on I.indigotica.

AB  - Drought is an extreme climate phenomenon that mainly results from abnormally low rainfall leading to water scarcity in an ecological system. Pakistan is already facing a serious threat of water shortages. The situation could further be intensified due to the prevailing drought conditions. Therefore, there is a need of consistent drought monitoring to observe drought severity; its duration and spread, to ensure effective planning to help mitigate its possible adverse effects. This study has utilized both satellite and in-situ data for consistent and accurate drought monitoring over Pakistan. Three major drought-intensive periods such as 1968-1975, mid-1980s and 1999-2003 were reflected in the standardized precipitation index (SPI) time series. The deviations of MODIS-NDVI values from their long-term mean were used as a tool to identify wetness and dryness conditions. The tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) precipitation (PPTN) data were used to derive monthly and annual accumulated rainfall. The deviations from the long-term mean (2001-2012) were calculated and mapped to identify drought-prone regions on country scale. It is hard to detect drought signal just from NDVI anomaly values on regional scale. Therefore, DSI index with high resolution and incorporated with MODIS-derived NDVI and ET/PET data was chosen as a tool for regional drought monitoring. The performance of MODIS-derived DSI was evaluated with satellite and in-situ precipitation data. The spatial correlation maps between DSI, TRMM-PPTN and SPI-3 were generated to evaluate the performance of DSI. Significant positive correlation values were present in winter (DJF); spring (MAM) and autumn (SON) seasons, in central parts of the country, portraying strong evidence that DSI is a good indicator for drought conditions especially for agricultural land in plain areas during these seasons. Most of this region is characterized by agricultural land cover and plays an important role in agricultural productivity of the country. Therefore, good performance of DSI would help scientists and policy makers to implement planning and risk reduction strategies in the region

AB  - One of the important goals in conservation biology is to determine reliable indicators of population viability. Sexual traits have been suggested to indicate population extinction risk, because they may be related to viability through condition dependence. Moreover, condition-dependent sexual traits may be more sensitive indicators of population viability than early life-history traits, because deleterious fitness effects of inbreeding tend to be expressed mainly at the end of the species' life history. However, empirical evidence of the significance of sexual behaviour for population viability is missing. In this study, we examined two male sexual traits and survival in 39 different-sized and isolated natural populations of the wolf spider, Hygrolycosa rubrofasciata. We also used several traits to estimate female reproductive success in 25 populations of H. rubrofasciata. According to previous studies, H. rubrofasciata males have a costly and condition-dependent acoustic signal, courtship drumming, which is the target of female choice. Males with a high drumming rate have considerably higher viability than males with a low drumming rate, and females that mate with the more actively drumming males gain genetic benefits in terms of increased offspring viability. Our results show that males in small populations had both lower survival and lower drumming rate than males in larger populations. However, we did not find any evidence for a decline in important early life-history traits (offspring number, hatching success or offspring body mass) or female body mass in small populations. Our results have two important messages for conservation biology. First, they show that sexual traits can be used as sensitive indicators of population viability. Second, the indirect benefits of female choice in terms of good genes might partially compensate for the reduction of viability in declining populations. Also, our results support the view that deleterious effects of small population size are expressed at the end of the species' life history.

AB  - Integrated management of irrigation and fertilization could meet global increasing demand from maize production and environmental pressures under water scarcity. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the long-term impact of irrigation scheduling and rates and timing of fertilization on water stress indicators, nitrogen uptake and leaching under maize on Chromic Luvisol (Sofia region). Modeling of the soil-plant system by the CERES-maize model was used. Adjusted and modified CERES-maize was run with different irrigation and fertilization scenarios and 30-year weather data. Scenario analyses proved that grain yield and N-uptake were severely affected on drylands under the conditions studied. Drought indicators showed that irrigation was required in 70% of the years. The sensitivity of maize drylands to precipitation in the critical (15 July-15 September) period caused great variability in maize yield (C-v=42%) and N-uptake (C-v = 25%) under nonlimited fertilization conditions. In addition, low vegetative precipitation proved to be a reason for fallow state leaching on drylands. All the irrigation scheduling tested improved N-uptake efficiency, mitigated drought and significantly reduced yield and N-uptake variability (C-v = 5-6%). An integrated management strategy of N-application timed to coincide with the period of maximum crop uptake and irrigation scheduled at 85% of field capacity reduced N available for leaching in the risky years. A drainage-controlling scenario, developed for 75-80% of the required irrigation depth and satisfying predominantly the most sensitive phases of maize development, saved up to 95 mm yr(-1) of water and reduced drainage in medium wet to wet fallow, states by 30-40%. Significant early-season N-losses (25% of applied N) were associated with precipitation extremes and poor N-dressing and could potentially happen in 3% of the years studied. Exceedance frequency of N-uptake under nonlimited fertilization conditions and different irrigation strategies was used to adjust more accurately the fertilizer rates and timing for the soil and climate variability studied.

AB  - Neutral red is a weakly cationic dye that is soluble in water, has a low toxicity for almost all classes of organisms, and has been used as a histological and vital stain since the early twentieth century. Estimating the volume of water cleared of indicator material by suspension feeding bivalves (clearance or filtration rate) was one of the earliest applications of neutral red; however, less than thirty studies have applied this methodology since it was first described in 1954. The feeding/clearance rate is used as a sensitive indicator of physiological stress and is therefore an early-warning tool that is suitable for monitoring the ecological status of water bodies. The aim of our study was to optimise a clearance index based on neutral red solution by addressing the effect of i) the acidifying pH; ii) the holding temperature before spectrophotometric reading; and the time iii) before and iv) after the acidification of solutions of neutral red used to carry out clearance assays. Furthermore, as a case study we fine-tuned the clearance assay for the edible estuarine bivalve, Cerastoderma edule. The results showed that there were no statistical differences as regards the absorbance of neutral red solutions holding at 4 or 20 degrees C or a solution acidified between the ranges of pH 4-5. However, the absorbance significantly decreased as the pH increased to pH 6. The time before acidification had no significant effect on absorbance. Once the neutral red solution is acidified, the absorbance decreases over time, signifying that the absorbance should be read in the first 24 h. The concentration of neutral red used in the experiences should be sufficient to allow final concentrations of over 0.5 mg/L after the clearance period, since we observed that the sensitivity of this protocol decreased at low concentrations. In the case of C. edule, the optimum clearance conditions per individual were found to be 100 ml of 4 mg/L of neutral red dye during a 30 min period in dark conditions. A bioassay using a clearance index of C. edule based on this simple colorimetric technique would appear to be a potential tool for implementation in environmental monitoring programmes for water quality assessment in accordance with European directives. We trust that the new harmonised protocol will become a widely used and cost-effective means to monitor the clearance index as an indicator of physiological stress for bivalves.

AB  - Benthic foraminifera are increasingly used as environmental bio-indicators of pollution in coastal and marginal marine settings. Their community structure provides information on the general characteristics of the environment and some species are sensitive to specific environmental parameters. Among various criteria, the occurrence of test abnormalities may represent a useful bioindicator for monitoring environmental impacts in coastal regions. A study of living benthic foraminifera was carried out in 42 sediment samples collected from the central Adriatic coast of Italy. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages from this area are rich, well preserved, and dominated by Ammonia parkinsoniana, and subordinately by Ammonia tepida, Aubignyna perlucida, Eggerella scabra, and Nonionella turgida. Heavy metal concentrations have been analysed which indicate low polluted environmental conditions. Foraminiferal species and heavy metal concentrations were investigated both with bivariate (correlation matrix) and multivariate techniques of principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis. Statistical analysis shows a possible control of these pollutants both on the taxonomic composition of the benthic foraminiferal assemblages and the development of test malformations. Increasing heavy metal contents lead to an increase in relative abundance of A. tepida A. perlucida, N. turgida and E. scabra, and a relative concurrent decrease in relative abundance of A. parkinsoniana and higher percentages of deformed specimens (FAI) and species (FMI). Our results confirm that A. parkinsoniana prefers clean to low polluted environments and show that it is a very sensitive and un-tolerant species to heavy metal pollution being deeply affected by heavy metal content even at low concentrations. Our findings also confirm the capacity of the A. tepida to tolerate increasing heavy metal concentrations, and highlights that A. perlucida, N. turgida and E. scabra can be considered as tolerant species at least in low polluted environments. Following this, A. parkinsoniana and A. tepida can be reciprocally considered good bioindicator of heavy metal pollution over the surveyed area. The development of test abnormalities with a variety of malformations is a noticeable feature over the study area where the living deformed assemblages are largely dominated by a few species. The low percentages of deformed specimens (Foraminiferal Abnormality Index up to 4.7, with 2 on average) match well with the low concentrations of heavy metals that lead to low polluted environmental conditions. This study confirms and supports the suitability of studying benthic foraminifera as a technique for the in situ continuous bio-monitoring of heavy metal pollution of coastal marine sediments.

AB  - Morphometric data are widely used in biology to assess intraspecific and inter-population variability and for bioindication and environmental condition assessment. The following hypotheses have been experimentally tested in the paper: 1) the vegetation type affects the change in the shell shape of Chondrula tridens martynovi Gural-Sverlova & Gural, 2010; 2) the change in the shell shape of this species is influenced by the biotope moisture regime; 3) the shell shape changes depending on the anthropogenic load level. The material in the form of empty, fully formed Ch. tridens shells was collected in 2019 in the north-western Azov region within the basin of the Molochna River. The collection points were located in settlements and outside them and differed in vegetation, moisture regime and level of anthropogenic load. The vegetation has been expertly attributed to two alternative types: herbaceous vegetation and tree plantations. By moisture level, the locations have been assessed as xerophytic and mesoxerophytic. The anthropogenic load levels have been assessed as low, medium and high. The study revealed that the morphological characteristics of Ch. tridens demonstrate a significant component of variability, which is due to the shell size. The shell size depends on the anthropogenic impact level. Under conditions of high anthropogenic impact, the shell size increases. Mollusks from locations with low and medium anthropogenic impact levels did not differ in shell size. After extraction of the size component, morphological properties develop three main trends of variability. The mouth apparatus development of mollusks does not depend on the vegetation type, but depends on the biotope moisture level and the anthropogenic transformation level. The mollusk shell elongation was observed to have the opposite dynamics of the height parameters in relation to the width and depended on the level of anthropogenic load. Rearrangement in the mouth apparatus depended on the biotope moisture level and the anthropogenic load level. There were distinguished four clusters, the quantitative morphological features of which allowed us to identify them as morphotypes. Each location was characterized by a combination of different morphotypes, according to which the sampling points may be classified. Morphotype 1 corresponds to biotopes with low level of anthropogenic load, morphotype 4 corresponded to biotopes with high anthropogenic load. Morphotypes 2 and 3 corresponded to moderate level of anthropogenic load. Vegetation type is not an important factor in determining the morphotypic diversity of populations. Under xerophytic conditions, morphotypes 2 and 3 are more common, and under mesoxerophytic conditions, morphotypes 1 and 4 are more common. The range of molluscs in different habitats needs to be expanded in the future to clarify climatic and other patterns.

AB  - The quality and potability of waters of the Tysmienica River Basin were determined in 2017 at eight measuring stations. The paper presents analyses of the physical and chemical parameters of surface waters of the basin. With regard to suspended solids, pH value, electric conductivity, sulphates, ammonia, chlorides and phosphate, the water was classified as having a very good ecological status. In the case of Kjeldahl nitrogen, the waters were classified as having a good ecological status. In the case of the remaining parameters, i.e. BOD, DO, TOC and COD, the status varied among stations. The values of all the physical and chemical parameters complied with the values for undisturbed conditions. Only ammonia and COD showed significant differences among stations. The WPI values for each measuring point ranged from 0.90 to 1.56, what corresponds to the descriptive indicators of moderately polluted water. The high concentrations of COD and TOC indicate that high-performance treatment processes (category A3) must be used to ensure that the water is suitable for drinking.

AB  - An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is compulsory in all types of new development. EIA is important to ensure that biological diversity is maintained and that development will not have any affect on the people and other species in that area. The aim of this study is to investigate the environmental impact on human wellbeing in the vicinity of quarrying. It will increase the awareness of the local population of the important factors that might affect the quality of their lives. A set of questionnaires was distributed to the community at Bandar Saujana Putra and Taman Kajang Perdana, in Selangor. A total of 60 residents were involved in the study. The results reveal that the community was concerned about health conditions and safety. However, there is still a lack of strategies to mitigate the problem. This study provides suggestions for mitigation that could be considered by the residents to reduce the effect of poor air quality caused by incorrect control and monitoring of activities in the area. It is anticipated that this study could assist both residents and authorities in improving the quality of the air as well as the residents' quality of life.

According to climate predictions, arid and semi-arid regions will become warmer, and a critical consequence for lake ecosystems is salinization. Salinity, a critical abiotic factor influencing zooplankton survival, changes the trophic interactions in a lake. We explored the potential effects of conductivity (an indirect measure of salinity) on the zooplankton taxa in three lakes located in the Konya Closed Basin, Turkey. Zooplankton taxa show significant differences between lakes of low and high conductivity but do not display significant seasonal difference except Cladocera. Species diversity is shown to decrease with conductivity. Large-sized cladocerans such as Daphnia and Simocephalus appear in freshwater lakes; conversely, the halobiont Brachionus plicatilis was observed only in the brackish lake. Our results show that the changes in salinity will have a substantial impact on aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - A review of the present state and future perspectives of the fishery in the Bulgarian marine part of the Black sea basin is presented. Following the approach suggested by the European Union (2008/56/EC) Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), particular species may be good indicators of specific environmental factors in their local environment. It is advisable to set the indicators for monitoring the healthy state of a marine fisheries ecosystem, concerning both pelagic and benthos organisms before making a suggestions and assessments about any given stock. Formal decision rules using these indicators for maintenance of the fishery ecosystem in a productive condition, and for stock recovery, need to be urgently implemented. In the present paper the example with sprat stock in the Black sea was emphasised. It was found that one of the main objectives for effective and sustainable management of the fish stocks is to make regular annual assessment of the parental stock biomass, length and weight growth, age determination, mortality estimation and reproductive potential estimation. Levels of fishing that break normal productivity of the given stock and to far-reaching effects caused by other environmental variations and anthropogenic activities.

AB  - The concept of viability envelopes (physical, chemical, biological levels) is developed as well as the general consequences and conditions to put in place a global and local sustainable development as defined by official institutions. The three logics and associated regulation processes that define a viable relation-space are presented. Some sentinel variables are proposed. There are, for example, the population life expectancy (PLE) and net photosynthetic production (NPP) on a soil or a sea of ecological quality, as well as the mean temperature and atmospheric CO2 variation velocities. These elementary indicators permit us to follow and evaluate the degree of interaction between human oxygen respiration and energetic consumption with the photosynthetic oxygen production by green plants, as well as the correlation with the thermic and greenhouse effect. The increase or decrease of PLE and NPP as well as the phase-space evolution of the thermic and CO2 pattern can give us a precocious information, for the near future, on the sense of sustainability (positive or negative way) provoked by a socio-economic pattern and energetic choice. A cybernetical model is presented as well as different ways of positive adaptation and management.

AB  - Environmental factors relating to soil pH are important regulators of bacterial taxonomic biodiversity, yet it remains unclear if such drivers affect community functional potential. To address this, we applied whole-genome metagenomics to eight geographically distributed soils at opposing ends of a landscape soil pH gradient (where "low-pH" is similar to pH 4.3 and "high-pH" is similar to pH 8.3) and evaluated functional differences with respect to functionally annotated genes. First, differences in taxonomic and functional diversity between the two pH categories were assessed with respect to alpha diversity (mean sample richness) and gamma diversity (total richness pooled for each pH category). Low-pH soils, also exhibiting higher organic matter and moisture, consistently had lower taxonomic alpha and gamma diversity, but this was not apparent in assessments of functional alpha and gamma diversity. However, coherent changes in the relative abundances of annotated genes between low-and high-pH soils were identified; with strong multivariate clustering of samples according to pH independent of geography. Assessment of indicator genes revealed that the acidic organic-rich soils possessed a greater abundance of cation efflux pumps, C and N direct fixation systems, and fermentation pathways, indicating adaptations to both acidity and anaerobiosis. Conversely, high-pH soils possessed more direct transporter-mediated mechanisms for organic C and N substrate acquisition. These findings highlight the distinctive physiological adaptations required for bacteria to survive in soils of various nutrient availability and edaphic conditions and more generally indicate that bacterial functional versatility with respect to functional gene annotations may not be constrained by taxonomy.
   IMPORTANCE Over a set of soil samples spanning Britain, the widely reported reductions in bacterial taxonomic richness at low pH were found not to be accompanied by significant reductions in the richness of functional genes. However, consistent changes in the abundance of related functional genes were observed, characteristic of differential ecological and nutrient acquisition strategies between high-pH mineral soils and low-pH organic anaerobic soils. Our assessment at opposing ends of a soil gradient encapsulates the limits of functional diversity in temperate climates and identifies key pathways that may serve as indicators for soil element cycling and C storage processes in other soil systems. To this end, we make available a data set identifying functional indicators of the different soils; as well as raw sequences, which given the geographic scale of our sampling should be of value in future studies assessing novel genetic diversity of a wide range of soil functional attributes.

AB  - Validation of soil moisture derived from space-borne passive microwave sensors remains a challenging task owing to the large variability in soil moisture within the coarse-resolution cell offered by passive sensors. In this article, nine spatial/temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data sets from Radar Satellite-1 (Radarsat-1) and Environmental Satellite-1 (Envisat-1) Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) were used as an interface to upscale the field-level soil moisture to soil moisture at a 25 km x 25 km grid, the scale at which the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the EOS (Earth Observing System) (AMSR-E) level-3 soil moisture product is available, leading to a total of 68 such grids where there is a pair of SAR-derived and corresponding AMSR-E-derived values. Out of the these 68 grid cells, each of size 25 km x 25 km, pair data from nine dates, data corresponding to 51 grid cell pairs (from six dates) were used for the development of the approach and data corresponding to 17 grid cell pairs (from three dates) were used for validating the approach. It is observed that while the spatial variation in SAR-and AMSR-E-derived soil moisture is broadly similar, there exists a bias in the difference between AMSR-E and SAR-derived soil moisture. The root mean square (RMS) difference between AMSR-E soil moisture and SAR-derived soil moisture at 25 km over the model development sample of 51 grid cells, each of 25 km x 25 km, was observed to be 4.2 (% g cm(-3)). The study shows that the bias is significantly affected by the AMSR-E vegetation/roughness parameter, g, which is an indicator of the prevailing vegetation/surface roughness conditions. This dependence of the bias on g was exploited to arrive at modified soil moisture estimates at 25 km. The RMS difference between the modified AMSR-E soil moisture at 25 km and the SAR-derived soil moisture was observed to be 2.13 (% g cm(-3)) over a validation sample of 17 grid cells each of size 25 km x 25 km, comprising extreme, dry and wet, and soil moisture conditions. This demonstrative study provides the feasibility of calibrating and improving the soil moisture product from coarse-resolution space-borne passive sensors with the help of soil moisture derived using SAR. The approach is demonstrated for validating passive radiometer-derived soil moisture over bare/crop-covered conditions through an experiment involving 68 25 km x 25 km grid cells spread over nine temporal/spatial Radarsat and Envisat-1 satellite SAR data sets and synchronous ground soil moisture measurements over farmers' fields, covering a large range of soil/crop conditions prevailing during the nine months of SAR data acquisition. Hence the results reported in this manuscript are encouraging.

AB  - Ecological Risk Assessment faces the challenge of determining the impact of invasive species on biodiversity conservation. Although many statistical methods have emerged in recent years in order to model the evolution of the spatio-temporal distribution of invasive species, the notion of extent of occurrence, formally defined by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, has not been properly handled. In this work, a novel and flexible reconstruction of the extent of occurrence from occurrence data will be established from nonparametric support estimation theory. Mathematically, given a random sample of points from some unknown distribution, we establish a new data-driven method for estimating its probability support S in general dimension. Under the mild geometric assumption that S is r-convex, the smallest r-convex set which contains the sample points is the natural estimator. A stochastic algorithm is proposed for determining an optimal estimate of r from the data under regularity conditions on the density function. The performance of this estimator is studied by reconstructing the extent of occurrence of an assemblage of invasive plant species in the Azores archipelago.

AB  - The rainwater system is an important part of the urban infrastructure as well as a key hub for maintaining the dynamic operation of the city and a clear indicator of the level of urban development. With the rapid development of urbanization, the hardened area of roads and residential areas has increased, and the construction of rainwater systems is so far insufficient, causing the urban waterlogging and water pollution problems to become increasingly serious. Accordingly, combined with the "sponge city" construction concept of the six-character policy of "seepage, retention, storage, use, purification, and drainage," we propose to adopt measures for the local conditions and to reasonably select sponge city engineering measures to increase rainwater utilization, effectively reduce rainwater runoff, and alleviate the city waterlogging and water pollution problems. We used the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to evaluate the effect of a sponge city "pocket park" rainwater system in Chaohu City before and after the transformation. The results showed that the pocket park after the renovation was well controlled, the waterlogging was basically eliminated, the water quality pollution was clearly improved, and the ecological environment was significantly improved.

AB  - Dr. Burk Dehority was an international expert on the classification and monoculture of ruminal ciliated protozoa. We have summarized many of the advancements in knowledge from his work but also in his scientific way of thinking about interactions of ruminal ciliates with the entire rumen microbial community and animal host. As a dedication to his legacy, an electronic library of high-resolution images and video footage catalogs numerous species and techniques involved in taxonomy, isolation, culture, and ecological assessment of ruminal ciliate species and communities. Considerable promise remains to adapt these landmark approaches to harness eukaryotic cell signaling technology with genomics and transcriptomics to assess cellular mechanisms regulating growth and responsiveness to ruminal environmental conditions. These technologies can be adapted to study how protozoa interact (both antagonism and mutualism) within the entire ruminal microbiota. Thus, advancements and limitations in approaches used are highlighted such that future research questions can be posed to study rumen protozoal contribution to ruminant nutrition and productivity.

AB  - Invertebrates constitute a substantial proportion of terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity and are critical to ecosystem function. However, their inclusion in biodiversity monitoring and conservation planning and management has lagged behind better-known, more widely appreciated taxa. Significant progress in invertebrate surveys, systematics and bioindication, both globally and locally, means that their use in biodiversity monitoring and conservation is becoming increasingly feasible. Here we outline challenges and solutions to the integration of invertebrates into biodiversity management objectives and monitoring in protected areas in South Africa. We show that such integration is relevant and possible, and assess the relative suitability of seven key taxa in this context. Finally, we outline a series of recommendations for mainstreaming invertebrates in conservation planning, surveys and monitoring in and around protected areas.
   Conservation implications: Invertebrates constitute a substantial and functionally significant component of terrestrial biodiversity and are valuable indicators of environmental condition. Although consideration of invertebrates has historically been neglected in conservation planning and management, substantial progress with surveys, systematics and bioindication means that it is now both feasible and advisable to incorporate them into protected area monitoring activities.

AB  - Two long-term (16 year) experiments on intensively managed pastures compared extensive grazing, abandonment and continued intensive grazing and were assessed for impacts on soil parameters, plant nutrient content and ecological indicator values. There was a reduction in soil carbon and nitrogen in the abandoned treatment compared to the intensively managed treatment at the wetter site. At the drier site, extensive grazing resulted in a build up of soil carbon. There was a build up of dead organic matter and a reduction in the nutritive value of the vegetation as grazing was reduced. Indicator values confirmed the reduced soil nutrients and a fall in site pH. There was also a rise in the dominance of plants preferring moist conditions, especially at the wetter site. As biodiversity gains are small, the management of these systems could be seen as a trade-off between managing for production and for soil organic carbon.
   At the drier site this trade-off is apparent, whereas at the wetter site managing for production also maximises soil carbon content. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A survey on the composition, abundance of macro invertebrates and application of some biological water quality indices at 36 sites in the West Aegean Sea River Basin District and the East Aegean Sea River Basin District was carried out as a part of a broad study on supplemental water quality survey. Totally 239 macro invertebrate taxa belonging to 21 benthic groups were established. The dynamics of the parameters number of benthic groups, number of taxa and total abundance depends on the specific ecological conditions. By the applied water quality indices the overall ecological estimation is made. Eight from the sampling sites belong to I category, 19 - II category, 5 - II- III category, 3 - III category and I - III - IV category. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to summarize the major patterns of variation within the physico-chemical parameters. Two Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) was used for classification of the species data. It divided the sites studied into 12 final groups and confirms to considerable extent the separation of the sites in PCA of physico-chemical parameters.

AB  - Rich foraminiferal assemblages from the Lower/Middle Devonian parastratotype at the Prastav Quarry near Prague (Barrandian area, Czech Republic) were studied in detail and correlated with foraminifers from seven sections of the same age from the Barrandian area. Forty-five taxa of foraminifers were recognized in the Lower/Middle Devonian boundary beds. Distribution of foraminiferal taxa in sections and their comparison with the respective paleoecological data show good potential for Devonian foraminifers to be used as paleoecological indicators. Psammosphaera cava, Pseudoastrorrhiza cf. irregularis, Saccorhiza pseudospiralis and Thuramminoides sphaeroidalis could tolerate unfavorable ecological conditions. Psammosphaera and Hemisphaerammina occurred in higher energy environments, while Ammodiscus ex gr. incertus required a low-energy environment. Morphometric variability of Ammodiscus ex gr. incertus (test size, number of whorls, size of proloculus) may indicate the presence of megalospheric and microspheric forms. Microspheric forms prevailed in unstable, higher energy environments. Multivariate analyses of foraminiferal assemblages enable differentiation of four types of foraminiferal assemblages whose spatial distribution corresponds well with lithofacies distribution. Changes in successive assemblages mirror shifts from low-energy to higher energy environments around the Lower/Middle Devonian boundary (= Basal Chotec Event).

AB  - Natural levels of heavy metals (HM) have increased during the industrial era to the point of posing a serious threat to the environment. The use of tree species to record contamination is a well-known practice. The objective of the study was to compare HM levels under different pollution conditions: a) soil pollution due to mining waste; b) atmospheric pollution due to coal-fired power plant emissions. We report significant HM enrichment in Pinus halepensis tissues. Near a burning power plant, Pb content in a tree wood was 2.5-fold higher that in natural areas (no pollution; NP). In mining areas, Cd content was 25-fold higher than NP. The hypothesis that HM contents in tree rings should register pollution is debatable. HM uptake by pines from soil, detoxification mechanisms and resuspended local soil dust is involved in HM contents in wood and bark. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Large, laboratory scale biological treatment tests of real industrial wastewater, generated in a large industrial laundry facility, was conducted from October 2014 to January 2015. This research sought to develop laundry wastewater treatment technology which included tests of a two-stage Moving Bed Bio Reactor (MBBR); this had two reactors, was filled with carriers Kaldnes K5 (specific area - 800 m(2)/m(3)) and were realized in aerobic condition. Operating on site, in the laundry, reactors were fed actual wastewater from the laundry retention tank. The laundry wastewater contained mainly surfactants and impurities originating from washed fabiics; a solution of urea to supplement nitrogen content and a solution of acid to correct pH were added. The daily flow of raw wastewater Qd varied from 0.6-1.0 m(3)/d. Wastewater quality indicators showed that the reduction of pollutants was obtained: BOD5 by 95-98%, COD by 89-94%, the sum of anionic and nonionic surfactants by 85-96%. The quality of the purified wastewater after the start-up period met legal requirements regarding the standards for wastewater discharged into the environment. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A list of alien ladybird (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) species to Europe was prepared and the history and circumstances of their introductions were determined. Currently there are 12 alien ladybird species in Europe, originating from Australian, Oriental, Nearctic, Palearctic and Afrotropical regions. All of the species were intentionally released as biological control agents and most are coccidophagous species. The aphidophagous Harmonia axyridis is the only ladybird regarded as invasive in Europe. The main factors leading to successful establishment were food relationship, living in different habitats in different geographical regions and geographic origin. We found that successful invaders, in their native areas, showed adaptability to a wide range of conditions compared to non-invasive species. Larger aphidophagous alien ladybirds were found to develop as fast as native species. Characteristics that did not differ between native and alien species are thermal requirements for development, fecundity and body size. However, unlike other alien ladybirds, H. axyridis had higher potential dispersal ability.

AB  - A battery of ecotoxicological assays of different trophic chain levels has been performed for water and sediment samples of two Greek vulnerable freshwater ecosystems (Karla Lake in Thessaly Region and Koronia Lake in Central Macedonia Region, respectively). These lakes, despite remediation programs, are still characterized by varied water quality. Furthermore, the quality of aquatic reservoirs aimed for human consumption as well as this of treated and untreated wastewater samples was also assessed through these bioassays. The outcome of the present research shows that condition of the studied lake ecosystems is still poor and intervention is needed for rectification of their continuous decline. Samples from treated municipal wastewater from the same regions were of medium to satisfactory quality, as measured by ecotoxicological assays. Despite causative relationships between burdened physicochemical parameters and increased toxicity, this toxicity could not always be attributed to these parameters. Results of bioassays in combination with standard physicochemical measurements of water samples may aid the integrated assessment of environmental risk arising from presence or release of these water samples in the ecosystem.

AB  - There is growing recognition that humans are faced with a critical and narrowing window of opportunity to halt or reverse some of the key indicators involved in the environmental crisis. Given human activities' scale and impact, as well as the overly narrow perspectives of environmental research's dominant natural sciences, a major effort is necessary to place the perspectives and insights of the humanities' and social sciences' perspectives and insights at the forefront. Such effort will require developing integrated approaches, projects, and institutions that truly do so. This article's goal is to help mobilize the social sciences and the humanities on the topic of sustainability transitions, but also call for a meaningful research agenda to acknowledge the profound implications of the advent of the Anthropocene epoch. We formulate the need for an innovative research agenda based on a careful consideration of the changing human condition as linked to global environmental change. The humanities and social sciences will need to change and adapt to this pressing, historic task. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pest Arrest in Central Queensland is an example of an emerging suite of initiatives that puts the theory? of management effectiveness evaluation into action. The program was initiated with the vision of maintaining, recovering and restoring the biodiversity and ecosystems of protected areas. Pest Arrest places importance upon high quality research, planning, pest control, monitoring, evaluation and reporting. Using ten showcase projects, Pest Arrest aims to move thinking and practice front pest management outputs (e.g. number of pigs controlled) to on-ground outcomes (e.g. restoration of a threatened ecosystem), and from a single species to a whole-of-ecosystem approach. Each showcase project adopts a comprehensive performance management framework. Particular attention is given to articulating desired outcomes that delineate the required condition of natural, cultural and recreational values in the protected area within a set timeframe. Detailed objectives with associated indicators and targets are provided to allow performance assessment. The program encourages a multi-disciplinary, team-based approach; community engagement; formation of partnerships; and 'learning by doing'. This article explores the major elements and adaptive framework of Pest Arrest.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH

KW  - ZIMBABWE
AB  - For sustainable crop production in semi-arid environments with low and erratic rainfall (<800 mm), runoff must be minimized and water conserved. However, little is known about how soils in semi-arid southern Africa respond to cultivation. This study investigated the hydrological and physical responses of a fersiallitic soil to conventional (flat) and improved (tied ridge) tillage practices over four seasons under natural and simulated rainfall conditions in Zimbabwe. Changes in soil surface roughness and the development of crusts were investigated and related to variation in the runoff ratio (total volume of runoff/total volume of rain). Relationships between runoff, rainfall intensity and antecedent precipitation index (API is an indicator of soil moisture content based on daily rainfall) were established for both systems. For the tied ridge system, API showed no significant contribution to runoff prediction. This reflects the greater and more stable depression storage capacity of the furrow in the tied ridge system. By comparison, the depression storage capacity of the flat system is temporary in nature and, as the micro relief of the soil surface weathers and crusts develop, its capacity declines, as does the time to pending and runoff generation.

AB  - Fluctuating resources and conditions can regulate the community structure of ants, affecting their activities and interactions. This has important implications for the selection of sampling periods during bioindication studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate if the chosen sampling period influences the response of ant assemblage diversity and ecological function to mining impacts and rehabilitation age after mining. We used ant assemblage parameters, including arboreal, epigaeic and hypogaeic ant species richness and composition, seed-removing ant species richness and composition, and seed removal rate in areas impacted by mining and with different rehabilitation ages. We showed that in most cases the response is the same, regardless of sampling period. However, we suggest that ant sampling is best undertaken in the rainy period, when ant species richness reaches higher values and the assemblage composition presents a well-marked difference among the areas. We also indicate that the epigaeic ant assemblage is sufficient for evaluating mining impacts, but arboreal strata should also be sampled in rehabilitation scenarios.

AB  - The richness and abundance of bryophytes in urban areas may be an indicator of environmental quality. In Mexico studies about moss diversity in urban areas and their use in environmental monitoring are scarce. This study identified the richness of epiphytic mosses of the metropolitan area of the Toluca Valley from the collection of all species present. Additionally, colonies of mosses were sampled plot method to determine the variations of their diversity in 16 parks. Floristic richness comprised 41 species and varieties included in 16 families among wich the Pottiaceae was the most numerous and frequent family. Sixty-five percent of the species have a wide geographic distribution. The Jacknife 1 and bootstrap estimators indicate that the inventory has between 71 and 85% of expected taxa. The epiphytic moss colonies tend to be diverse (H=2.3) and are represented, in order of importance by Syntrichia amphidiacea, Leskea angustata, S. fragilis, S. pagorum and F. ciliaris that were those with high ecological weight. The green areas analyzed have low average similarity (ISj=0.30) potentially associated with their microclimatic conditions and their proximity to urban centers.

AB  - Anthropogenic nitrogen autotrophy of a territory is defined as the nitrogen flux associated with local production of harvested crops and grass consumed by livestock grazing (in kg N/km(2)/yr). Nitrogen heterotrophy is the nitrogen flux associated with local food and feed consumption by humans and domestic animals. These two summarizing characteristics (anthropogenic nitrogen autotrophy and heterotrophy (ANAH)) indicate the degree of anthropogenic perturbation of the nitrogen cycle by agriculture and human consumption: their balance value provides information on either the potential for commercial export or the need to import agricultural goods; in a watershed, their vector sum is related to the nitrogen flux delivered to the sea. These indicators were calculated for all the watersheds in the Global Nutrient Export from Watersheds (NEWS) database for 1970 and 2000, as well as for 2030 and 2050, according to Millennium Ecosystem Assessment scenarios. During this 30 year period, many watersheds shifted from relatively balanced situations toward either more autotrophic or more heterotrophic conditions. This trend is predicted to become more pronounced over the next 50 years.

AB  - This paper presents the use of physics of failure (PoF) methodology to infer fast and accurate lifetime predictions for power electronics at the printed circuit board (PCB) level in early design stages. It is shown that the ability to accurately model silicon-metal layers, semiconductor packaging, printed circuit boards (PCBs), and assemblies allows, for instance, the prediction of solder fatigue failure due to thermal, mechanical, and manufacturing conditions. The technique allows a life-cycle prognosis of the PCB, taking into account the environmental stresses it will encounter during the period of operation. Primarily, it involves converting an electronic computer aided design (eCAD) circuit layout into computational fluid dynamic (CFD) and finite element analysis (FEA) models with accurate geometries. From this, stressors, such as thermal cycling, mechanical shock, natural frequency, and harmonic and random vibrations, are applied to understand PCB degradation, and semiconductor and capacitor wear, and accordingly provide a method for high-fidelity power PCB modelling, which can be subsequently used to facilitate virtual testing and digital twinning for aircraft systems and sub-systems.

AB  - The need to respect environmental considerations in terms of resource consumption and harmful production has led to formulate regulations for green building. While some countries have started developing green building rating systems, some others are following the existing systems. Iran does not comply with any of the existing systems due to political reasons and does not utilize such a system officially. The purpose of this study is to add environmental water attitudes to Madad's Green Building Model, which was developed solely on the basis of environmental climatic factors. The model of each city is a function of its climatic and demographic conditions and is implemented on the basis of expert advice and AHP methodology. The results of the monetary valuation studies were used to improve the selection of indicators and to accurately define their weighting in the model. The indicators in the current study are to reduce runoff volume, water consumption, and the reuse of grey-water. The assessment results of the study area showed that only 11% of these green building capabilities had been used.

AB  - Fish farming in net cages causes changes in environmental conditions. We evaluated the resilience of zooplankton concerning this activity in Rosana Reservoir (Paranapanema River, PR-SP). Samples were taken near the net cages installed at distances upstream and downstream, before and after net cage installation. The resilience was estimated by the decrease in the groups' abundance after installing the net cages. The zooplankton community was represented by 106 species. The most abundant species were Synchaeta pectinata, S. oblonga, Conochilus coenobasis, Polyarthra dolichoptera and C. unicornis (Rotifera), Ceriodaphnia cornuta, Moina minuta, Bosmina hagmanni and C. silvestrii (Cladocera) and Notodiaptomus amazonicus (Copepoda). The resilience of microcrustaceans was affected in the growing points as this activity left the production environment for longer, delaying the natural ability of community responses. Microcrustaceans groups, mainly calanoid and cyclopoid copepods, had a different return rate. The net cage installation acted as a stress factor on the zooplankton community. Management strategies that cause fewer risks to the organisms and maximize energy flow may help in maintaining system stability.

AB  - Generally, great efforts are made in measuring features of landfill covers. However, conventional physical or chemical parameters reach their limits in indicating the small scale changes of the habitats. Bio-indication is a proven tool to assess habitat conditions. The advantages of vegetation monitoring are obvious: cheap, easy, and integrating over time and space. Our study displays, how vegetation can indicate landfill cover features by adapting some common evaluation methods. Ellenberg's ecological indicator values were used, but ubiquitous species were excluded from multivariate data analysis of the Ellenberg values. Four groups of habitats were distinguished according to their cover material: (i) loamy substrates; (ii) wet hollows and areas with mature compost; (iii) fresh compost and mechanically biologically treated waste; (iv) slag from municipal solid waste incineration and leachate-influenced areas with fresh untreated waste or sewage sludge. The differences were assessed by ecological indices. The results give a promising impression of the potential vegetation monitoring has in the indication of landfill cover features.
