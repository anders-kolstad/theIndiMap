"iDescriptionSnippet","This indicator aims to evaluate how the percentage of forest protected by Natura 2000 site has being changed  against time. The changes could be due to changes of ecosystem extent, for example due to agricultural abandonment, or also be associated with changes in the protection zones, either by the designation of new  areas or by the modification of the limits of those already existing. Both cases are included in this assessment  since the indicator values are from overlap the spatial information, by means of spatial analysis tools, of CLC  2000, 2006 and 2012 with Natura 2000 network informed by MS end of 2013 (previous versions of spatial data  of Natura 2000 present gaps and geometric inconsistences), and from CLC 2018 with Natura 2000 version  provided by 2018.

Progress in designating sites was slow at first but currently the protected area is over 18 % of the EU?s  land area being the largest network of protected areas in the world (EEA, 2012).
