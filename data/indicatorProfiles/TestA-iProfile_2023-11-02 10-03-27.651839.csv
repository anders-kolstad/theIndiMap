"iDescriptionSnippet","Crop diversity in agroecosystems is a measure of the variety of different crops in a given spatial unit. In  general, higher crop diversity is considered to be beneficial for soil quality, to contrast the emergence of  weeds and pests outbreaks and to support biodiversity, as diverse crops provide a more variegated and  temporally distributed sources of food (e.g. for birds and bats).  JRC Unit D5 collects data on crop acreage in arable land, based on statistics provided by National Institutes  of Statistics and to Eurostat. Based on this, yearly arable crop area is modeled on a 25 Km grid covering the  EU-28. This data has been used to derive, for each grid, the Shannon Diversity Index (SDI) , a common  measure of diversity used in ecology, for arable crops. To this end, data were preprocessed by merging  some categories to avoid double counting. The higher the value, the higher the  level of crop diversity. The index is sensitive to both the total number of crops occurring in a cel l and their relative shares. When there is only one crop in a cell (minimum diversity), the index equals 0. The maximum  possible value would be when all 17 crops are present in a cell with an equal share. "
